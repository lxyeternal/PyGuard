{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'systoring' that provides cross-platform system monitoring functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; reading package requirements from install_requires and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted input; the code does not process user input or untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The package description mentions 'For Educational Purposes ONLY!!!' but this is likely just a disclaimer. No suspicious or unusual code behavior is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging. It reads a README file for the long description and specifies package dependencies for different OSes. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The dependencies are typical for system monitoring tools and do not appear malicious. The presence of OS-specific extras suggests intended cross-platform use. No anomalies or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The disclaimer appears to be for informational purposes only. Overall, the script is safe and unremarkable from a security perspective.",
