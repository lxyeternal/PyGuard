  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for distributing a system monitoring library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, defining dependencies in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network calls, no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. It reads a README file, specifies dependencies, and calls setup() with metadata. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The minimal security risk score (0.1) in the first report is justified as very low, but overall, the code is benign. All reports correctly identify the static, safe nature of the script and assign appropriate scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate; the malware and obfuscation scores should be 0, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
