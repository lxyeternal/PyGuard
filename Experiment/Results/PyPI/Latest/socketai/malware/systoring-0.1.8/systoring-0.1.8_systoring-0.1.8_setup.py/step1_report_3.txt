{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'systoring', including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description, specifies package dependencies in install_requires and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing; no external data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; setup configuration is static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The description claims the library is for system monitoring and is for educational purposes only; no hidden malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions, reads a README file for package description, and specifies dependencies and classifiers. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. No suspicious code, obfuscated sections, or malicious behaviors are present. The dependencies are typical for system monitoring libraries, and the setup script does not execute any runtime code beyond static configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script appears legitimate, standard, and free from malicious behavior. It does not contain any anomalies or malware indications. The code is straightforward and suitable for package configuration without security concerns.",
