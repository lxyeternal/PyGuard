{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'systoring', including metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long_description, package metadata declarations, and dependencies specified in install_requires and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code primarily sets up package metadata and dependencies without executing untrusted data or performing I/O beyond initial file reading.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md (source) -> setting up package parameters (sink). Dependencies specified for installation but not executed here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The description claims educational use but does not contain malicious content. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file for description, specifies package details, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are static and standard for Python packaging. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or sabotage are present. The dependencies listed are common for system monitoring tools, aligning with the package description. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies without executing or retrieving external data during runtime.",
