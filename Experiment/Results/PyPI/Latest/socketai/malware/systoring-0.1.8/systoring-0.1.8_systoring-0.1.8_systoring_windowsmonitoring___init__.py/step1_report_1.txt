{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports for a Python package, importing specific classes and enums for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; the code only performs imports and defines __all__",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules to make classes and enums available externally; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and enums from internal modules and sets the __all__ list for module exports. There are no data inputs, network operations, or suspicious behaviors. The imports suggest modular design; however, without the implementation of imported modules, no malicious activity can be inferred from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module interface definition with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply exposes certain classes and enums for use elsewhere.",
