  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a package's __init__.py file, used for defining module exports.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes and enums from local modules (windowsmonitoring, enums, utils). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or external data; only module imports and __all__ declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely performs imports and an __all__ declaration; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initialization script, importing specific classes and enums and defining what is publicly accessible. It does not process or handle external data, nor does it contain dynamic code execution or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
