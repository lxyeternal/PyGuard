  "purpose": "Module initialization and export declaration for a Python package, exposing classes and enums for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import statements establish source-to-export flows; no data flows or dynamic behaviors detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard import and __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ list, typical for a package's __init__.py. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns indicate benign intent. All reports correctly identify this as a standard, safe module setup, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initialization file with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk accurately reflect the code's nature.",
