  "purpose": "This code is setting up module exports for a package, importing specific classes and constants for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no handling of untrusted data, external network connections, or sensitive data processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible here; this is purely import and export statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and typical for module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and constants from local modules and defines __all__ for exports. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or credential handling. There is no obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks present. The code appears to be standard package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports and exposes components from local modules for use elsewhere.",
