  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that imports specific classes and enums for use elsewhere, likely related to Windows monitoring or system utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils; imported classes and enums: WindowsMonitoring, Senders, Features, Utils, Prtts, Lfr, Grb.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data is processed or transmitted within this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows or function executions; just imports and __all__ declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, indicating it is a module's initialization or export file. It imports classes and enums from sibling modules but does not perform any data processing, network operations, or sensitive handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely exposes certain classes and enums for external use.",
