  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate abstract class template with a significant security concern: the ability to disable SSL verification globally. While not malicious or obfuscated, its potential misuse warrants a high security risk score (~0.6). The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at zero. Proper caution should be exercised when calling _create_unverified_https(), especially in production environments."
