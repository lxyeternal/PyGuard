  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines an abstract class `AbstractSender` for data transmission.\n- Contains an SSL configuration method `_create_unverified_https()` that disables SSL certificate verification globally.\n- Uses abstract methods for data retrieval (`__get_sender_data`), data sending (`__send_archive`), and execution (`run`).\n- No executable logic in the class itself; relies on subclasses.\n- No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The `_create_unverified_https()` method disables SSL verification globally, which is a security risk if misused.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent within this code snippet.\n\n### Flaws & Reasoning:\n- The reports correctly identify the security concern with disabling SSL verification.\n- All reports agree that the code is a template, not malicious on its own.\n- The security risk is mainly if `_create_unverified_https()` is called in production or malicious modules.\n\n### Scores & Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.6; considering the potential for misuse, a score of **0.4** seems reasonable, but some reports suggest slightly higher (0.6). Given the potential for misuse but no evidence of actual malicious use, **0.4** is justified.\n- **Overall risk score:** Also varies, but since the code is a template with a dangerous SSL method, a risk score of **0.4** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The main concern is the presence of `_create_unverified_https()`, which disables SSL verification globally.\n- If this method is called in subclasses or elsewhere, it could facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks.\n- The code itself does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.4 (potential security concern due to SSL bypass, depending on usage)\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The use of `_create_unverified_https()` should be restricted or used with caution.\n- The code should include warnings or restrictions about disabling SSL verification.\n- The template itself is legitimate but potentially dangerous if misused.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                     |\n| Security Risk   | 0.4                   |\n\nThe code is a standard abstract class with a notable security concern (SSL verification bypass). No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present, but the SSL method's presence warrants caution.\n\n**Would you like me to generate a summarized security advisory based on this analysis?**",
