  "purpose": "Template for data transmission modules, providing an abstract class with SSL configuration control.",
  "sources": "The static method _create_unverified_https() that disables SSL verification globally.",
  "sinks": "Calling _create_unverified_https() can lead to insecure SSL connections, exposing data to interception.",
  "flows": "If _create_unverified_https() is invoked before network communication, it disables SSL verification for subsequent requests.",
  "anomalies": "The method _create_unverified_https() overrides default SSL context globally, which is unusual and risky in production environments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class for sending data, with a method that disables SSL verification globally. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The primary concern is the security risk introduced by _create_unverified_https(), which, if called, undermines SSL security and could facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks. The code itself is clear and intended as a template; the security concern depends on its usage. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, but the security risk score should be elevated due to the SSL bypass potential. The scores across reports are consistent; a risk score of approximately 0.6 is justified given the security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate abstract class template with a significant security concern: the ability to disable SSL verification globally. While not malicious or obfuscated, its potential misuse warrants a high security risk score (~0.6). The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at zero. Proper caution should be exercised when calling _create_unverified_https(), especially in production environments.",
