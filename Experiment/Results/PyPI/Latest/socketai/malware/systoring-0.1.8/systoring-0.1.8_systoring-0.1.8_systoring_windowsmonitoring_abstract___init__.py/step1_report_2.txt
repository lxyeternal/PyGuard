  "purpose": "Defines an export for the AbstractSender class from a relative module sender.",
  "sources": "The code imports AbstractSender from a local module sender.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or sensitive data exposure points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; only an import and export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets. No obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing a class and defining the __all__ list for module exports. There are no data processing, network operations, or security-sensitive functions. It appears to be a standard module setup with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, consisting only of an import statement and an export list. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security concerns are evident.",
