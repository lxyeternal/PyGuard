  "purpose": "This code module imports a class 'AbstractSender' from a local sender module and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .sender import AbstractSender",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data output",
  "flows": "Import from sender module to __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a simple import and export of a class. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with full confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code aligns with standard Python module practices and presents no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module export with no malicious or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
