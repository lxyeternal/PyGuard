  "purpose": "This code module exports an abstract sender class for use in a larger project, likely related to message or data transmission.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing AbstractSender from a relative module; exports list __all__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input; code simply defines an export.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement and an __all__ declaration, which are standard practices for module exports in Python. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, no data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious code constructs. The minimal structure indicates a straightforward module definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple module export with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
