{
  "purpose": "This code defines an import from a local module and specifies an export for that class, likely part of a larger package for sending data.",
  "sources": "The code reads only from the local module .sender to import AbstractSender.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external communication occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows are evident as the code only performs an import and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for Python package modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module and declares __all__ for module exports. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs. It appears to be a simple, clean module fragment setting up a class for external use.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard module snippet with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely exports a class from a local module, with no external data handling or suspicious patterns.",
