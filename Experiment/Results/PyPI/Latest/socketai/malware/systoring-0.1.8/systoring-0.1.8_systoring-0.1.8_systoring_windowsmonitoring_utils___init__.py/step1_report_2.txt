  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from local modules and defines an export list, likely for a package's API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (ast, mssg, lfr, prtt, grb).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; the code only imports modules and defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not handle external input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements and a list defining exported symbols. There is no data processing, user input handling, or dynamic execution. All imported modules are from local files, and the code appears straightforward. No suspicious behavior, malware indicators, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization snippet for a Python package, importing classes from local modules and exposing them via __all__. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
