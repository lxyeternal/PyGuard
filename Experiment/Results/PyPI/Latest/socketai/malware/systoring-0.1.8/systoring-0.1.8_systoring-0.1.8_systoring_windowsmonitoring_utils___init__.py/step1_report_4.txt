  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes from relative submodules and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no data output or external communication",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks; purely import statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements from internal modules and an __all__ declaration. No external data input, no untrusted data handling, and no suspicious behavior detected. It functions solely as an aggregator or interface to expose specific classes from other modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
