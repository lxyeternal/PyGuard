  "purpose": "Module initializer importing classes from local submodules and exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (.ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external communication, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Import statements load classes; no data flows or external interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export of classes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports classes from local submodules and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's nature. No issues or vulnerabilities are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
