  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes from local modules and defines the public API of the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands are present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only imports modules and defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes from sibling modules and exposes them via __all__. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The structure indicates a typical package __init__.py file. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious logic are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a package initializer that defines available classes. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
