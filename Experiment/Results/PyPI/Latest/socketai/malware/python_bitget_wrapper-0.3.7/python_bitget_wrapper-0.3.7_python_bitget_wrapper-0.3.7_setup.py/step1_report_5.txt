  "purpose": "To define and configure the setup parameters for packaging the 'python-bitget-wrapper' Python project, including metadata and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code primarily sets package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content flows into 'long_description' parameter in setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md').read() without handling potential file exceptions; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata and configuration for distribution. It reads a local README.md file to set the long description, which is standard practice. No user input or untrusted data is processed; no network or system commands are executed. The code structure is typical for a setup script, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. There are no hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, benign setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily handles package metadata and uses common practices. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
