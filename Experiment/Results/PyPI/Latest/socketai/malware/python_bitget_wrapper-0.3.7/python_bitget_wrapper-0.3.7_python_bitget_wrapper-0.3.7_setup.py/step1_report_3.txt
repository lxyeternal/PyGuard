{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'python-bitget-wrapper', including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network or file output beyond reading the README file.",
  "flows": "The only flow is reading 'README.md' to include as long description during package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read a file for long description is typical; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. It reads a local file 'README.md' for the long description and sets package metadata. No network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling are evident. The code does not contain any suspicious behavior or malicious patterns. It follows common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
