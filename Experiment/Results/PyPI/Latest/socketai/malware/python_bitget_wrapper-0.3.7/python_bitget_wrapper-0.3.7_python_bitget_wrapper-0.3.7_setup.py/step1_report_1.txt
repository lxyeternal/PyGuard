{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'python-bitget-wrapper', defining its metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package information from the 'setup()' function, specifically the 'long_description' from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; no external data processing or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content to include as long_description during packaging; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The script is straightforward and standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for packaging, specifies package metadata, and reads 'README.md' for the long description. It does not execute any dynamic code or external commands. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious operations are present. The use of 'open' is for reading a static file, which is typical in setup scripts. All parts align with standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a normal Python setup script for packaging a library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
