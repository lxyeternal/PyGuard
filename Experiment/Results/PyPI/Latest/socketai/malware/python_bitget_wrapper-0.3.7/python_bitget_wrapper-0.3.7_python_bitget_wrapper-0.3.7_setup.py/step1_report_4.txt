{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'python-bitget-wrapper' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points; no untrusted data handling or external calls beyond standard setup functions.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md file during setup flows into the long_description parameter; no other data flow or untrusted input processing detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and follows standard Python packaging practices. The open() call on 'README.md' is typical for including long descriptions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools to configure package setup parameters. It defines package metadata such as name, version, packages, description, URL, author info, and Python version requirements. The only file operation is reading 'README.md' to set the long_description, which is standard and safe. There are no suspicious functions, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or network operations. The code structure and content indicate a typical setup script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard for Python package distribution and does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe to use.",
