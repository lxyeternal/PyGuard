  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a library, defining metadata and reading README.md for description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Static reading of local file; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of open() without exception handling, but this is common in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or processing of untrusted input. It reads a local file for documentation, which is standard. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are justified and accurate.",
