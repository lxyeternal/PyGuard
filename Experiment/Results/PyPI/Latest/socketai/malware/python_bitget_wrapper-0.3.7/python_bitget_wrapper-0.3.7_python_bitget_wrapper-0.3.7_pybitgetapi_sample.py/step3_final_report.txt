  "purpose": "A simple addition function that returns the sum of two inputs.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'a' and 'b' as input data.",
  "sinks": "Return statement output; no external data sinks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow directly to the return statement, producing the sum.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward addition with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic addition function with no external dependencies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. It reads input via parameters and outputs the sum directly. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or external calls are present. The code's simplicity and clarity strongly suggest benign intent. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and have high confidence in this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward addition function with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
