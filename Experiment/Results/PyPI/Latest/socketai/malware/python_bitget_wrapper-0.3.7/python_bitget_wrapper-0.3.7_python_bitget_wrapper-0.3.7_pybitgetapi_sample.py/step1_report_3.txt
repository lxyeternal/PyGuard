{
  "purpose": "Simple addition function, likely for basic arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'a' and 'b' received from function call, no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the sum; no external sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow directly to the return statement as 'a + b'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward addition operation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function that adds two parameters and returns the result. No input validation, no external data sources, no obfuscated code or suspicious constructs. There are no hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or dynamic code execution. The function appears benign and typical for utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign addition function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
