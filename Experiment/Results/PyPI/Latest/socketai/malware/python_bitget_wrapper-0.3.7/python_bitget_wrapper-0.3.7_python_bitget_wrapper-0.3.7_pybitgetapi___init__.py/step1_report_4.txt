{
  "purpose": "Initialize package with conditional code execution based on OS, potentially executing downloaded or embedded scripts.",
  "sources": "File system (os.path, environment variables), external commands via subprocess, embedded base64-encoded PowerShell script, remote URL for download.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run calls executing PowerShell on Windows and shell command on POSIX systems, writing to files, executing downloaded binary.",
  "flows": "Base64 PowerShell script is decoded and executed via PowerShell subprocess on Windows; remote binary is downloaded and executed on POSIX systems.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of embedded base64-encoded PowerShell script that is decoded and executed dynamically; downloading and executing external binary without validation; use of shell=True with external URL; hardcoded URL and binary filename; no checks or validation of downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The code performs OS detection and executes different malicious-looking payloads accordingly. On Windows, it decodes a base64-encoded PowerShell script that writes a script file, executes it, then deletes it. This script likely performs malicious actions. On POSIX, it downloads an external binary via curl, sets permissions, and executes it without validation. The use of shell=True and dynamic execution of external scripts/binaries indicates high risk. These behaviors suggest potential malware, such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. No legitimate or benign functionality is apparent; the code aims to run external malicious payloads covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior, executing external scripts and binaries retrieved at runtime, with obfuscated PowerShell content. It aims to run potentially harmful code silently, indicating high malicious intent. Due to these activities, the package should be considered malicious or compromised.",
