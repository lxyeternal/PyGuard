{
  "purpose": "Initialize the package and execute potentially malicious code depending on the operating system.",
  "sources": "OS environment variables, external URLs via curl or embedded base64-encoded scripts, subprocess calls to run commands.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing shell commands with embedded scripts or downloaded binaries, file creation, and execution.",
  "flows": "OS detection leads to execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands or downloaded binary, which are then executed via subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads and executes code, executing downloaded binary with wide permissions, use of shell=True with curl command, hardcoded URLs, and obfuscated script embedded in code.",
  "analysis": "The code distinguishes between Windows and POSIX systems. On Windows, it decodes and executes a base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads and runs a script from an external URL, then deletes it. On POSIX systems, it downloads a binary from an external URL, sets permissions, and executes it. Both behaviors involve executing external, untrusted code and binary files, which could be malicious. The use of obfuscated scripts and downloading external payloads are typical indicators of malicious activity or compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote scripts and binaries, with obfuscation techniques employed. It is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, as it could be used for malware delivery, remote control, or data exfiltration.",
