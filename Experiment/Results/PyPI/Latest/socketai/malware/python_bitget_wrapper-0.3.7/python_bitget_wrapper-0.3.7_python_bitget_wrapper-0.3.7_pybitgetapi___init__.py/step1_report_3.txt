  "purpose": "Initialize package and execute platform-specific scripts that may perform remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "os.name check, embedded base64-encoded PowerShell script, external URL download via curl.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run calls executing potentially malicious commands, including PowerShell script execution and binary download.",
  "flows": "Based on platform detection, executes embedded PowerShell script or downloads and runs external binary, possibly leading to code execution or data theft.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated base64 PowerShell script, download and execution of remote binary, use of shell=True with curl command, hardcoded URL pointing to external resource, potentially malicious if executed.",
  "analysis": "The code first checks the operating system. On Windows (nt), it decodes and executes a base64-encoded PowerShell script that writes to a PowerShell script file, executes it, then deletes the script. The script appears obfuscated and potentially malicious. On POSIX systems, it downloads a binary from an external URL, sets its permissions to executable, and runs it in the background, which could be a malicious payload. The use of shell=True and external URLs suggests a high risk of malicious activity. The embedded PowerShell code and external binary downloads are classic signs of malware behavior, such as remote code execution, persistence, or exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, potentially malicious scripts that execute external commands and download external binaries, indicative of malicious activity and security risk. It should be treated as malware with a high probability score.",
