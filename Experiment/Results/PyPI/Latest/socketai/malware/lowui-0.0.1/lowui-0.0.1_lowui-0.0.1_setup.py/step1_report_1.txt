{
  "purpose": "To define the package metadata and setup configuration for the Python package 'lowui'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings and package information; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present; no untrusted data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is purely declarative package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses the setuptools library to define package metadata for distribution. All data are static and predefined. No external inputs, dynamic code execution, or network activity are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for package setup scripts, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides package metadata without any suspicious elements.",
