  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Content**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. The code only contains static strings defining package metadata, with no dynamic input, network calls, or obfuscated code. There are no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \nNo errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports. They all correctly interpret the code as a benign setup script.\n\n3. **Score Justification & Consistency**  \n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Correct, as the code is straightforward and contains no obfuscation.  \n- **Malware Score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity or code is present.  \n- **Security Risk Score (0):** Correct, the code is static and does not pose any security risks.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**  \nThe reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code as a standard setup script.\n\n5. **Score Reasonableness & Adjustments**  \nAll scores seem appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Justification:\nThe code is a typical package setup script with static data, no dynamic or external inputs, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
