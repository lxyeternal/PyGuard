  "purpose": "Define package metadata for 'lowui' using setuptools in a static setup script.",
  "sources": "Static strings in the setup() call: name, version, author, description, packages",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input is processed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static data used directly in setup()",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic input, network activity, or obfuscation. It contains only hardcoded package metadata, which is typical for Python package configuration. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature make it highly unlikely to contain malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All signals and reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate.",
