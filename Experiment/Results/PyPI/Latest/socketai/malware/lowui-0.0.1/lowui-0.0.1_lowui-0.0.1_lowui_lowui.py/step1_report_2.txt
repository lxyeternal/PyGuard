{
  "purpose": "Download and execute a file from a remote URL using PowerShell commands embedded in Python.",
  "sources": "Reading current working directory, fetching file via curl.exe through PowerShell, checking file existence, and executing the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "Executing the downloaded file with Start-Process, which can run potentially malicious code silently.",
  "flows": "curl.exe download command → PowerShell execution → check file existence → Start-Process to run the file.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading an executable from an external URL and immediately executing it without verification or user consent. No validation of the downloaded file. Use of PowerShell commands embedded within Python code. No explicit checksum or signature verification for the download.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL and then runs it silently. The download URL is hardcoded, pointing to a specific file on GitHub. The use of PowerShell commands via subprocess is a common technique for executing system commands; however, executing remote code without validation is a significant security concern. The script does not perform any checks on the downloaded file's integrity or authenticity. Running the downloaded file immediately poses high risk of executing malicious payloads, especially given the context of fetching from an unverified source. The code does not include any obfuscation or evasion techniques, but its behavior indicates potentially malicious intent due to automatic execution of external content.",
  "conclusion": "This script automatically downloads and executes a remote executable file, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior or supply chain attack potential. The lack of validation, combined with silent execution, significantly increases security risk.",
