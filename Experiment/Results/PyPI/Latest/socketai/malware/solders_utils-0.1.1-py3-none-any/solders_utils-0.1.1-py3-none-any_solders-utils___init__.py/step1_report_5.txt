  "purpose": "Import various functions and variables from a local modules package, and define package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions and variables from the .modules package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only imports modules and defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; standard import and metadata definition.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a local package and the definition of version and author metadata. There are no functions, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or other suspicious activities. The imported functions are not shown here, so potential malicious behavior could reside within those modules, but based on this snippet alone, no malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and functions solely to organize module imports and metadata. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this fragment.",
