  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward import statement from a local module and defines metadata variables. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious activity is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard import and metadata assignment. No anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard import from local modules, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard import and metadata setup. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as previous; benign import and metadata declaration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code presence:** The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of import statements and metadata definitions.\n- **Malware risk:** None of the reports or the code snippets indicate malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is present; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** The code is harmless, with no data leaks, dynamic execution, or external network activity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should stay at 0, given the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, reflecting no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the provided code snippets and reports, the overall assessment is that this is a benign, standard module setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should not be adjusted upward.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
