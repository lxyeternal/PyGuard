  "purpose": "Import various functions and variables from the local modules to be used in the package, and define package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from relative modules.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow beyond import statements and variable definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard import and metadata declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple functions and variables from local modules, which suggests modular design. The only other statements are defining version and author metadata. There are no signs of malicious code such as dynamic execution, network operations, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The import paths are relative and do not suggest malicious resource loading. No obfuscation or malicious behavior indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module setup with standard imports and metadata. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
