  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward import statement plus metadata. No anomalies, no malicious activity, no obfuscation. The confidence is high (0.9), and the malware score is 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; the report is accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it notes standard import and metadata definitions. No suspicious patterns or anomalies. The confidence is perfect (1), and malware is 0.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the analysis finds no anomalies or suspicious activity. The code is standard module import and metadata setup. Confidence is 1, malware 0.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—nothing suspicious, no obfuscation, no malware. The code is a simple import plus metadata.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no anomalies, no malicious activity, standard import and metadata. Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still aligned.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Presence:** The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of import statements and metadata variables.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify the absence of malware and obfuscation.\n- **Security Risks:** No signs of vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- If future code includes dynamic execution, network calls, or suspicious patterns, these scores should be revisited.\n- The current assessments are consistent and justified based on the provided code snippets.\n\n**In conclusion, the current reports are accurate and appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.**",
