  "sinks": "None",

  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard import and metadata definition",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple functions and variables from a relative module, indicating modular code structure. The metadata variables (__version__, __author__) are standard and do not introduce security risks. No input or data reading from untrusted sources or external inputs is present. No sinks or data flows are observed that could lead to vulnerabilities. The import appears to be for code organization, with no suspicious or malicious activity evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard module imports and metadata assignment without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
