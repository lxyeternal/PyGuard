  "purpose": "Import various functions and variables from a local modules package and define package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module '.modules'",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow analysis needed as code is only import and variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple functions and variables from a local modules package, which appears to be part of a larger project. It then sets version and author metadata. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations. The import statements are standard and do not involve dynamic execution or untrusted data sources. The metadata assignments are typical for package identification. The code is straightforward and contains no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and metadata declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears safe and typical for a Python package.",
