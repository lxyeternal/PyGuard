{
  "purpose": "This code imports functions from a local module and defines package metadata, serving as a module setup or initialization script.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .modules; no external data sources or inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks, network connections, or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions without data flow to external systems; no source-to-sink data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and metadata definitions, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling. The import functions are standard and assumed benign. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, reflecting its harmless nature.",
