  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Functions for message handling and a transaction confirmation via Telegram.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Private key from `wallet.secret()` flows into the message, which is sent via `requests.post` to Telegram.\n- **Anomalies:** Private key is converted to hex and embedded directly into a message, which is then transmitted externally.\n- **Analysis:** The main security flaw is the inclusion of the private key in plaintext in an external message, exposing sensitive credentials. The functions are placeholders, indicating incomplete implementation, but the critical issue is the leakage of secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.2, Security Risk 0.75. These seem reasonable; the malware score is low because there's no active malicious payload, but the security risk is high due to secret exposure.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, constructing messages for blockchain transactions, including secret keys.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Wallet secret flows into the message and is sent via Telegram API.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded token and chat ID, private key included in plaintext.\n- **Analysis:** The consistent pattern of leaking private keys in plaintext over an external API is highly suspicious. No malicious code per se, but severe security vulnerability.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.8, Security Risk 0.85. Slightly higher malware score due to the potential for malicious exfiltration if misused, which is justified given the exposure of secrets.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar purpose, with the same pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Private key in hex form sent over Telegram.\n- **Anomalies:** Same hardcoded token, private key in message.\n- **Analysis:** Same security concern—exposing secrets via external API. No malicious payloads.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.75. The malware score is zero because no active malware or backdoor is detected; it's a security lapse.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with stub functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Private key leaks via Telegram.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded credentials, private key in message.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern—leaking secrets, no active malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.9, Security Risk 0.95. The malware score is high, perhaps overestimating; no malicious code, but the severity of secret leakage warrants a high security risk score.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with focus on constructing and verifying transactions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Private key flows into messages sent to Telegram.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded token, private key in plaintext.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern of secret leakage, no malicious payload.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.6. Appropriate; no malware, but notable security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports, except possibly report 2 and 4, indicate no active malicious code. The high malware scores in reports 2 and 4 seem to be driven solely by the secret leakage pattern, which is more of a security vulnerability than malware. I would reduce these scores accordingly.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports indicate no obfuscation, which aligns with the code being straightforward and placeholder-like.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The core issue is the exposure of private keys via external messaging, which is a severe security flaw. The risk should be high, especially if used in production.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code is **not actively malicious** but **contains serious security vulnerabilities**—primarily, leaking private keys over an external API (Telegram). This pattern could be exploited maliciously if the code were used in a real environment.\n\n- The **malware score** should be **lowered** from the reported 0.8-0.9 to around **0.2-0.3**, reflecting that no malware payload is present, just secret leakage.\n\n- The **security risk** should remain **high (around 0.75-0.85)** due to the potential for credential theft.\n\n- The **obfuscation score** remains **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0.2     | 0            | 0.75  |\n| 2       | 0.3     | 0            | 0.85  |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.75  |\n| 4       | 0.3     | 0            | 0.95  |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.6   |\n\n**Overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** ~0.2 (due to secret leakage, not active malware)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** ~0.75 (high, due to secret exposure)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is primarily a security hazard because it leaks sensitive private keys via unencrypted external communication. It is not malicious in the traditional sense but should be considered highly insecure and potentially malicious if misused.",
