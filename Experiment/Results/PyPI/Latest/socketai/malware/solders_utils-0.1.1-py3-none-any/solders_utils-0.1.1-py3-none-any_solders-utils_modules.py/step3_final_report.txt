{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for message creation, signing, verification, and transaction handling, with a specific function to confirm transactions by sending details via Telegram.",
  "sources": "Retrieval of wallet secret via wallet.secret(), and hardcoded credentials within confirm_transaction function.",
  "sinks": "Requests to Telegram API, transmitting plaintext private key and transaction details.",
  "flows": "wallet.secret() → message string construction → requests.post to Telegram API with private key and transaction info.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of private key in plaintext within external message; hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; placeholder functions with no real implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code leaks private keys by embedding them directly into messages sent over an external API, exposing sensitive credentials. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present, but the insecure handling of secrets constitutes a severe security vulnerability. The functions are mostly placeholders, indicating incomplete implementation. The leakage pattern suggests potential misuse if exploited maliciously, but the code itself does not perform malicious actions beyond secret exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the intentional or negligent exposure of private keys via external messaging, which is highly dangerous. While not malware in the traditional sense, this pattern creates a critical security risk that could be exploited maliciously. The malware score should be high due to the severity of secret leakage, and the overall security risk is very high. Obfuscation is not present.",
