      "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the intentional or negligent exposure of private keys via external messaging, which is highly dangerous. While not malware in the traditional sense, this pattern creates a critical security risk that could be exploited maliciously. The malware score should be high due to the severity of secret leakage, and the overall security risk is very high. Obfuscation is not present."
