{
  "purpose": "Send private key data to a remote API and check a switcher endpoint to determine a return value.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'private_key' parameter as input and uses it to create 'transaction_data'. It also makes GET and POST requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "The 'private_key' data is sent via POST request to an external API; switcher response is fetched via GET request, potentially exposing or relying on external data.",
  "flows": "Input 'private_key' flows into 'transaction_data' and is transmitted through a POST request to the external API. The GET request to 'switcher' retrieves data that influences the function's return value.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a misspelling 'ptivat_key' instead of 'private_key' in the data payload. It directly sends private key data over the network without any encryption or security checks. No validation of input or response handling is present. The external URL appears suspicious and is hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The function 'perm' takes a private key as input and constructs a data payload with a misspelled key. It then posts this data to an external API, which could be malicious if the endpoint is controlled by an attacker or if the data is sensitive. The function also performs a GET request to another endpoint to retrieve a 'switcher' value, which influences the return value. The lack of input validation, error handling, and secure transmission raises security concerns. The hardcoded external URLs and transmission of private data without encryption are suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent such as exfiltration of sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code potentially leaks private keys by sending them to an external, possibly malicious server, and uses external data to determine control flow. The misspelled key and lack of security measures increase suspicion of malicious behavior. Overall, this code exhibits signs of data exfiltration and insecure practices, warranting a high security risk assessment.",
