  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'tronyx' Python package including metadata, dependencies, and repository info.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description, static string values for package metadata and URL.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no external data output or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "N/A; all operations are static and configuration-based.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code follows standard setup pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file for the long description, specifies package requirements, author info, and repository URL. There are no dynamic or user input operations, no obfuscated code, no network calls, and no suspicious behavior. The repository URL appears legitimate. Overall, the code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard package configuration with no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
