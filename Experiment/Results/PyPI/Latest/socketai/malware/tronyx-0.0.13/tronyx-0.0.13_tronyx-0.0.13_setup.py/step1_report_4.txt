  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'tronyx' Python library, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static package configuration data; external requests library dependency.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted within this script.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the script primarily sets configuration parameters for package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution present. Use of standard setup tools and straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures using setuptools, reads a README file for long description, and specifies package dependencies and metadata. All actions are typical and safe. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. No external data is fetched at runtime beyond static file reading, and no network connections or sensitive data handling is involved.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is safe for use.",
