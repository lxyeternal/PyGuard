  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this single import statement; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this snippet; it only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any unusual or suspicious constructs. The import is from a relative module, which is common in package code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic execution, or data exfiltration. The import suggests reliance on local module functionality, which is standard. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears benign, performing a straightforward import from a local module. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks within this single line of code.",
