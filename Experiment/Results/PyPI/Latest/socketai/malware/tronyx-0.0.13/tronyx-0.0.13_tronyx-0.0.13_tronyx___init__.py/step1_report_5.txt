  "purpose": "The code imports the 'perm' object or function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'perm' from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external data output is observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; only a single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol from a local module, which is a common practice in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The minimal nature of this code makes it unlikely to be malicious. However, the actual behavior depends on the content of the 'main' module, which is not provided. As it stands, this code snippet alone does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no indications of malicious activity or security risks. It appears benign but is insufficient alone to determine the full security posture of the package.",
