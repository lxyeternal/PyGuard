{
  "purpose": "The code imports a variable or function named 'perm' from a module named 'main' in the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .main import perm'",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "The code imports 'perm' from 'main', but does not execute or use it here",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; minimal code provided, straightforward import statement",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, which is a standard Python operation to include a component from a local module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No environment variables, external data sources, or untrusted inputs are involved. The simplicity and common usage of import statements make this benign. Since this is only a fragment, it's not possible to evaluate potential malicious uses of 'perm' elsewhere, but within this snippet, there are no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a benign part of a larger codebase.",
