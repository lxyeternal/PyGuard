  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a relative module. It does not include any input handling, data processing, or network operations. Since it only imports a local component, there are no apparent security risks or malicious behaviors. However, this analysis is limited by the brevity of the code; more context is needed to assess the overall security posture.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet alone poses no security threats or malicious behavior. It is a standard import statement with no suspicious activity detected.",
