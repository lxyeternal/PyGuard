{
  "purpose": "To assess whether the code 'from .main import perm' exhibits malicious behavior or security risks within the supply chain context.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local module 'main' and symbol 'perm'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if 'main' or 'perm' contain malicious code, they could execute harmful actions upon import.",
  "flows": "Importing 'perm' from 'main' is a direct source-to-sink flow; execution of 'perm' could lead to malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import, common in Python projects. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are evident. The security implications depend on the content of 'main' and 'perm', which cannot be assessed here. The minimal nature and standard syntax suggest benign intent. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and security risk score to 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging the importance of the imported module's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate given the limited context. Further review of the 'main' module is recommended for comprehensive security assessment.",
