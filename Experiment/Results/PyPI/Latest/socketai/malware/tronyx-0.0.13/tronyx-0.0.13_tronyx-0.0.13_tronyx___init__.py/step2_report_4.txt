  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple Python import statement: `from .main import perm`.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The import is from a local module, which is standard practice.\n- The code snippets are minimal, providing no context for malicious activity.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code in all reports is accurately described: a straightforward import statement.\n- No issues are present in the code snippets themselves.\n- The analysis and conclusions in each report are consistent with the code.\n\n### Flaws or logical mistakes:\n- No flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code based on the provided snippet.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8 to 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n- Malware scores are correctly set to 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are very low, reflecting the minimal code and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since the code is only an import statement, and no further context is provided, it's reasonable to keep the malware score at 0.\n- The security risk score could be slightly increased if the 'main' module is from an untrusted source, but with no evidence, keeping it low is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score remains 0, as there's no obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, due to minimal code and standard practice)\n\n**In conclusion:**\nThis code snippet is benign, and the scores assigned are appropriate. Without additional context or code, there's no reason to suspect malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are reasonable.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the minimal nature of the code.",
