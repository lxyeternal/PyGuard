{
  "purpose": "The code imports a specific attribute or function named 'perm' from a local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; only a static import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs. The import is from a relative module, which is standard in Python projects.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement, which is a common practice for modular Python code. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. Since it only imports 'perm' from a local module, there is no evidence of malicious intent. The absence of additional code makes it impossible to determine any malicious behavior beyond this line.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard code structure used in Python projects. No malicious activity is indicated.",
