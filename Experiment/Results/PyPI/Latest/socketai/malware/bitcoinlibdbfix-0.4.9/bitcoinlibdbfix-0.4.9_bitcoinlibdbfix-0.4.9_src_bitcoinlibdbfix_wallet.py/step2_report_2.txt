  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code matches the description; no discrepancies noted.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The code prints sensitive info like passphrases and WIF keys, which is insecure but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0. The report's scores seem reasonable.\n- **Justification for risk scores:** The low risk score (0.2) is appropriate given the sensitive data handling but no malicious activity.\n- **Overall assessment:** No malware, no obfuscation, and the security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code aligns with the description; no issues found.\n- **Errors or flaws:** Similar to Report 1, sensitive info is printed, which is insecure.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.2, obfuscated = 0. Reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; the risk is primarily from insecure handling of secrets, not malicious intent.\n- **Overall:** No malware or obfuscation; security risk is low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code matches; no discrepancies.\n- **Errors or flaws:** Same pattern—printing passphrases and keys, insecure but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.2, obfuscated = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior; security concern is the exposure of secrets, not malicious code.\n- **Overall:** No malware, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code aligns; no issues.\n- **Errors or flaws:** Printing sensitive data is insecure, but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.2, obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent, just insecure handling.\n- **Overall:** No malware, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code matches; no discrepancies.\n- **Errors or flaws:** Similar pattern—printing secrets, but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.2, obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification:** No malware or sabotage; security risk is low.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity (score 0). Given the code's behavior—standard wallet management, no network exfiltration, no obfuscated code, no malicious payloads—this is accurate.\n  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports give 0, which is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** The main concern is printing sensitive data, which is a security issue but not malicious. The reports' scores of 0.2 are reasonable, reflecting a low security risk primarily due to insecure practices rather than malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — consistent with the reports; the insecure handling of secrets (printing passphrases and private keys) is a security concern but not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the security risk is minimal but should be addressed in practice.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No supply chain sabotage or malicious intent is evident in this code. The main security concern is the insecure handling of sensitive data, which should be improved but does not constitute malicious activity.",
