{
  "purpose": "Manage Bitcoin wallets, generate keys, import transactions, and send transactions using the bitcoinlib library.",
  "sources": "User inputs via args (wallet_name, network, passphrase, database, etc.), JSON transaction files, and command-line parameters.",
  "sinks": "Printing sensitive data (passphrases, WIF keys, transaction hashes), file reading (JSON), network transactions via wallet.send_to and tx.send().",
  "flows": "Input args → wallet creation/import functions → sensitive data printed or written to network → transaction data loaded from files → transaction broadcasted or imported.",
  "anomalies": "Printing passphrases and private keys to stdout, lack of validation for imported JSON data, no encryption or secure handling of secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard wallet operations with no signs of malicious behavior. It reads user inputs and files, and outputs sensitive information directly, which is insecure but not malicious. No obfuscation, network exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The main security concern is the insecure handling of secrets, but this does not indicate sabotage or malware. The code relies on trusted libraries and standard practices, with no suspicious external connections or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical wallet management script with insecure practices (printing secrets) but no malicious intent or supply chain sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the insecure handling of secrets. Overall, it is safe from a security perspective, but best practices should be followed to avoid exposing sensitive data.",
