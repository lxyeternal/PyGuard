  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is a standard wallet management script with no malicious intent. It notes that sensitive info like passphrases and WIF keys are printed, which is a security concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; the assessment aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to report 1, emphasizing standard operations, no malicious behavior, but printing sensitive data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; security concerns are standard.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard wallet functions, printing sensitive info, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Highlights that sensitive data (passphrases, private keys) are printed, which is insecure but not malicious. No suspicious code or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; security best practices are not followed but no sabotage.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others; uses standard libraries, no suspicious code, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports identify any malicious code, network exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risks:** The main concern is printing sensitive data (passphrases, private keys), which is a security vulnerability but not malicious activity.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All assigned scores are consistent with the analysis—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n### My Reasoned Estimates:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code appears clear.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — security concern due to printing sensitive info, but no active threat or sabotage.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code performs legitimate wallet operations.\n- No evidence of supply chain sabotage, malware, or malicious payloads.\n- The security concern is mainly due to insecure handling (printing secrets), which warrants a low risk score but not higher.\n- The consistent absence of suspicious network activity or obfuscated code supports these scores.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the overall assessment that the code is standard, with some insecure practices but no malicious intent.",
