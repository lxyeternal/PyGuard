{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information, gather files from specified directories, encode them, and exfiltrate data via Telegram, Discord, and a custom API endpoint, potentially for surveillance or data theft.",
  "sources": "Requests to external IP geolocation API, local file reads, hardcoded tokens, URLs, and static hashes.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to messaging platforms and custom API, file uploads, and data encoding for transmission.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system info and files (sources) into payloads that are sent over HTTP to external servers (sinks), often without validation or encryption.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded API keys, tokens, webhooks, URLs, and static hashes; typo in 'send_directory_files' method referencing 'send_to_all' which is undefined; no data sanitization or encryption; straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code facilitates data exfiltration by collecting system info and files, encoding them, and transmitting to external services. Hardcoded secrets and multiple exfiltration points suggest malicious intent or high malicious potential. No malware payloads or obfuscation are present, but behavior aligns with covert data theft tools. The code's structure and signals indicate it could be misused for surveillance or data theft in a supply chain context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious with high exfiltration capability driven by hardcoded secrets. It does not contain overt malware or obfuscation but poses significant security risks if deployed maliciously. The malware score is justified at 0.75, and the security risk is high at 0.8, reflecting its potential for abuse.",
