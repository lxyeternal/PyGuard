{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system and network information, gather files from directories, and send this data through various communication platforms (Telegram, Discord, and a custom API).",
  "sources": "Requests to external APIs for IP geolocation; reading local files for sending attachments; reading environment variables for credentials; reading files from specified directories.",
  "sinks": "Requests to messaging APIs (Telegram, Discord, custom API) with potentially sensitive data; file reading and uploading to external services; use of hardcoded credentials.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system inputs (files, environment variables) into functions that package and send data to external services, including IP info, files, and messages. Credentials are used directly in request URLs and payloads, potentially exposing sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded API tokens and webhook URLs are present, which pose security risks. The code collects and uploads files without explicit user consent, and the method 'send_directory_files' automates mass data collection and transmission. No explicit user input sanitization is evident. The 'authority_hash' is hardcoded. No obfuscated code detected, but the use of hardcoded secrets and unrestricted file uploads are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script automates data collection (IP info, files) and sends this data to external platforms using hardcoded credentials and URLs. It appears to be intended for covert data exfiltration, given its ability to gather system info and files without clear user prompts or restrictions. The inclusion of hardcoded tokens and webhook URLs, along with functions that upload potentially sensitive files, indicates malicious intent or at least malicious potential if misused. The code's structure facilitates automated, silent data exfiltration, which is characteristic of malware. No obfuscated code or typical malware signatures like reverse shells are present, but the behavior strongly suggests malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior primarily due to hardcoded credentials, automated data collection, and transmission to external services. It appears designed for covert data exfiltration rather than legitimate functionality. The security risk score is high due to these factors, and malware likelihood is also elevated. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the deliberate data exfiltration mechanisms.",
