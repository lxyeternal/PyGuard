  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface for managing Bitcoin wallets, importing transactions, and handling private keys with options for file and text input.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, including file paths and text data for passwords, passphrases, and private keys.",
  "sinks": "Methods that send data to 'send_to_all' and 'send_directory_files' in the database object, potentially transmitting sensitive data. Also, printing errors to console.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are checked for file paths or text. File paths are sent via 'send_to_all' as files, and sensitive text is conditionally sent with anonymized labels. Error messages and data are sent to external functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of len(arg_value) > 20 to determine if input is encrypted, which is arbitrary. Sending all sensitive data or errors via 'send_to_all' without clear validation. No explicit encryption or security controls on transmitted data.",
  "analysis": "The code reads command-line input for wallet management tasks, including importing files and private keys, with some checks for file existence. Sensitive data (passwords, private keys) are transmitted to external 'send_to_all' functions, which could lead to data leakage. The logic for detecting encrypted input is simplistic and unreliable. Error handling involves transmitting error messages and directory files, which may inadvertently expose sensitive information. No obfuscation is present, and third-party library usage appears standard. No malicious network activity or harmful system modifications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard command-line wallet manager with potential security concerns related to transmitting sensitive data via external functions without encryption or validation. No malicious code, backdoors, or malware behavior is detected. The main risk is potential inadvertent data leakage due to transmitting sensitive info. Overall, it does not exhibit malicious intent but warrants caution regarding data transmission practices.",
