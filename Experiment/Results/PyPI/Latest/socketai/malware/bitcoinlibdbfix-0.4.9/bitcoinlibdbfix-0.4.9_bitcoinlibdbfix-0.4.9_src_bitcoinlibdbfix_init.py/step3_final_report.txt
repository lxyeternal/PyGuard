  "anomalies": "Execution of run_pre_install() during import without clear validation or restrictions",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing modules and executing run_pre_install() if available. No malicious code or obfuscation is evident. The main concern is that run_pre_install() could contain malicious actions, but without its implementation, this remains speculative. The pattern of executing setup routines during import is common but can be exploited if the function is malicious. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate. The security risk score could be slightly increased from 0.1 to 0.2 to reflect the potential risk of executing arbitrary code during import, but overall, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package setup code with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The main risk is the execution of run_pre_install() during import, which warrants review of that function's implementation. The scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2). A conservative approach suggests setting the risk score to 0.2 to account for potential misuse, but overall, the code is benign.",
