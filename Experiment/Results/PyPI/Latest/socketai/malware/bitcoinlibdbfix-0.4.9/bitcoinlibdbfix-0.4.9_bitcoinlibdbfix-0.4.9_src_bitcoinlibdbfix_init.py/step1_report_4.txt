{
  "purpose": "To define package exports and run pre-install checks during installation",
  "sources": "Import statements for main, __version__, and run_pre_install",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or malicious data handling observed",
  "flows": "Execution flow from importing modules to conditionally calling run_pre_install",
  "anomalies": "Use of a try-except block to run a pre-install function; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports core components and exports them via __all__. It conditionally executes run_pre_install during import if the installer module is available, which is typical for setup routines. No evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful behavior. The pre-install function's implementation is not shown, but its invocation here is standard for setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard package initialization and setup routines without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
