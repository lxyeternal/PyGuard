  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package by importing main functions and version info, and attempts to run a pre-install check if available.",
  "sources": "Import statements for cli, version, and installer modules; execution of run_pre_install() if present.",
  "sinks": "run_pre_install() could execute code from the installer module, which may perform various actions depending on implementation.",
  "flows": "Import of modules -> optional execution of run_pre_install() during import -> potential execution of code within run_pre_install().",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import and execution of run_pre_install() could potentially hide malicious behavior if run_pre_install() contains harmful code, but this depends on the module's implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports main functions and version info, which is typical. It attempts to run run_pre_install() if available, which may perform setup tasks. The safety depends on the contents of run_pre_install(), which is not shown here. No malicious code or suspicious behavior is evident in this snippet alone. The try-except block prevents errors if run_pre_install() is missing, which is normal. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package initialization with optional pre-install checks. No evidence of malicious behavior is present in this snippet. The potential risk hinges on the implementation of run_pre_install(), which cannot be assessed from this code alone.",
