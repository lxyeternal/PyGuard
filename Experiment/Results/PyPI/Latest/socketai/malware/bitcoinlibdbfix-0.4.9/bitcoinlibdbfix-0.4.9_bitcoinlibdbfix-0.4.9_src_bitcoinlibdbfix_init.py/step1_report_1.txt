  "purpose": "Module initialization and setup, including importing main functions and version info, and running pre-install checks if available.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.cli, .version, .installer) and the execution of run_pre_install() during import.",
  "sinks": "The run_pre_install() function call could potentially execute code with side effects if the module is imported during installation.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> execution of run_pre_install() (if available) during module import.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional execution of run_pre_install() during import is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module exports and attempts to run a pre-install routine if the installer module is available. The try-except block ensures that failure to import run_pre_install() does not cause errors. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are evident. The conditional execution of pre-install checks is typical for setup scripts but could be misused if run_pre_install() contains malicious code, which cannot be determined from this snippet alone. Overall, the code appears benign and standard for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard package boilerplate for setting up module exports and executing optional pre-install routines. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is observed within this snippet.",
