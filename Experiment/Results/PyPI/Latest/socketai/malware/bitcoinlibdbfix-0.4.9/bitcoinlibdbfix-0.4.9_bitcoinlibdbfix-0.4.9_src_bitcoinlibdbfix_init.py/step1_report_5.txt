{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a package initialization script that imports core functions and version info, and runs pre-install checks if available.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.cli, .version, .installer), execution of run_pre_install during import",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; run_pre_install may perform checks, but no evidence of untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Import statements and conditional execution flow, primarily package setup logic",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of run_pre_install executed during import; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports core components and exposes them via __all__, a standard pattern. The conditional execution of run_pre_install occurs during import, which is typical for setup scripts. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are evident. The try-except block handles ImportError gracefully, avoiding crashes if installer module isn't present. Overall, the code follows standard package initialization practices without signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script performing setup routines and exposing key components. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this snippet.",
