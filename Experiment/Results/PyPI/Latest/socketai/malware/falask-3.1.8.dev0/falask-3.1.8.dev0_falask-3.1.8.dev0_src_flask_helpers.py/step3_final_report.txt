  "purpose": "Utility functions for Flask applications, including environment variable handling, response creation, URL generation, file serving, and session-based messaging.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., FLASK_DEBUG, FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV), request context, session data, Flask globals, Werkzeug utilities.",
  "sinks": "Response objects, URL endpoints, file paths, session storage, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence configuration; request context provides request/session data; functions generate responses, URLs, or serve files based on input data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard Flask utility functions, leveraging Werkzeug for secure file handling and response management. Environment variables are used for configuration, which is typical. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code is well-structured, readable, and follows best practices for web application utilities. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The security risk scores assigned in the reports (around 0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the reliance on environment variables and user input paths, but these are handled securely. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask utility module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
