  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for a Flask web application, including response handling, URL generation, request context management, and security features such as sending files and flashing messages.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (get_debug_flag, get_load_dotenv), request context (_cv_request), session data (flash, get_flashed_messages), request environment (send_file, send_from_directory), module import specifications (get_root_path).",
  "sinks": "werkzeug.utils.send_file, werkzeug.utils.send_from_directory, current_app.redirect, current_app.aborter, current_app.response_class, werkzeug.exceptions.abort, response headers in make_response.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → get_debug_flag, get_load_dotenv; request context → stream_with_context; session data → flash, get_flashed_messages; file serving functions → send_file, send_from_directory; URL generation and redirects → url_for, redirect; exception handling → abort.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are evident. The code uses standard Flask and Werkzeug functions, with no obfuscated code or dynamic execution beyond standard pattern matching. No external network connections or data exfiltration methods are present. Use of request environment and session is typical for Flask apps. The functions operate within expected parameters for a web framework.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Flask utility module, providing response creation, URL building, request context management, and security-related helpers. The functions rely on standard Flask globals and Werkzeug utilities. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. The use of environment variables for debugging flags and dotenv control is standard. File sending functions correctly sanitize paths, and no untrusted input appears to be used in a way that could lead to code injection or data leaks. Flash message handling and response creation are straightforward. There is no evidence of covert channels, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is well-structured, uses recommended practices, and does not contain obfuscated logic or unusual code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask utility module without signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It implements common web framework functionalities securely, with no suspicious behavior detected. Overall security risk is low, and no malicious activity is evident.",
