  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard Flask utilities with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is low (0.2). The confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Verdict:** The assessment appears accurate. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes standard Flask functions, with no suspicious behavior. Malware score is 0, and security risk is minimal.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical Flask utility module, with no signs of malware or malicious logic. Malware score is 0, and confidence is 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Correctly identified as safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The functions are standard, with proper handling of environment variables, request context, and session data. No obfuscation or malicious patterns. Malware score is 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is typical Flask utilities, with proper use of Werkzeug's secure functions, no signs of malicious activity. Malware score is 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's nature—standard Flask utilities with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk scores:** Very low (mostly 0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (standard Flask utilities with minimal configuration concerns)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code appears safe, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.",
