  "purpose": "Provides testing utilities for Flask applications, including environment setup, request building, session management, and CLI testing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, request objects, session interfaces, CLI invocation parameters",
  "sinks": "Request environment, session storage, CLI command execution",
  "flows": "Input data flows into environment copying, request creation, session handling, and CLI invocation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Flask testing patterns, environment management, and request handling. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. Use of copy() for request objects and environment copying is typical. Version fetching via importlib.metadata is benign. No suspicious data flows or obfuscated code are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, standard testing utilities for Flask applications with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
