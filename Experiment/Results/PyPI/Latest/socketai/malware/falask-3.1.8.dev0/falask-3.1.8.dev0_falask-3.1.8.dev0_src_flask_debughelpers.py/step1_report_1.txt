{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions, error classes, and debugging aids for a web application framework, likely Flask or similar, including error handling, request patching, and template debugging.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from request.form, request.files, and request context; template attempts are based on loader and source objects.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage through error messages and logging; possible modifications to request.files.__class__, but no dangerous code execution points identified.",
  "flows": "Input from request.form or request.files can trigger custom error handling; template loading attempts read loader info; patching request.files.__getitem__ can influence request handling behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; code uses assertions and exception handling properly; no obfuscated code, cryptic dynamic execution, or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily utility and debugging support for a web framework. It defines custom exceptions to improve error reporting, patches request objects for better error messages, and provides detailed logging for template loading attempts. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communications, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications. The request patch alters the class of request.files for better error handling, which is a standard debugging technique. The logging functions and error classes are consistent with enhancing developer experience, not malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate utility and debugging support code for a web framework, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It enhances error reporting and template debugging without introducing vulnerabilities.",
