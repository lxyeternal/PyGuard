  "purpose": "Utility functions, error classes, and debugging aids for a web framework, including request patching for better error reporting.",
  "sources": "request.form, request.files, request_ctx.request.blueprint, loader.__dict__",
  "sinks": "Error messages, request.files.__class__ override, logging output",
  "flows": "Request data accessed via request.form and request.files; request.files.__class__ patched to override __getitem__ for debugging; loader info logged",
  "anomalies": "Patching request.files.__class__ is unconventional but used here for debugging; no malicious code or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code provides debugging utilities and custom error classes, with request object modifications for enhanced error messages. No external network activity or malicious behavior is present. The class patching is a known debugging pattern, not malicious. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are evident. The scores reflect low security risk and no malware, with a slight increase due to class patching, which is acceptable in debugging contexts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign debugging and utility support code for a web framework, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The class patching, while unusual, is a standard debugging technique and does not pose a security threat. The overall security risk is low.",
