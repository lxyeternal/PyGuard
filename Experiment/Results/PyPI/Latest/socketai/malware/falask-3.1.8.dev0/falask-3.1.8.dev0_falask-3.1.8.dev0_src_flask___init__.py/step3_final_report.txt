{
  "purpose": "Import statements from internal modules related to a web framework, likely Flask, setting up the namespace with components such as Flask, Blueprint, Config, request context, globals, helpers, signals, templating, and wrappers.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules; no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "None; purely static imports without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, typical for setting up a web framework environment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The high confidence scores (close to 1) are justified due to the straightforward, static nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a setup or configuration module for a web framework, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, non-malicious nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
