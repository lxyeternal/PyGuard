  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, data flows, and scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard import statements from local modules, likely for a web framework like Flask.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data handling or external input/output; purely static imports.\n- **Anomalies:** None; straightforward code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign setup code with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.95 seems too high given the benign nature. Since no malicious activity is detected, a risk score of 0.1 or 0.2 would be more appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1—static imports from local modules, no data processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=1.0 appears overly cautious. Given the lack of any suspicious activity, a risk score of 0.1 or 0.2 is more reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Re-exporting components for convenience; no data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=1.0 again seems excessive. A low risk score is justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: static imports, no data flow or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=1.0 should be lowered.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar benign import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=1.0 should be reduced.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly have malware=0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly have obfuscated=0, no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—purely import statements with no data handling, no external communication, no dynamic code execution—the risk scores should be very low, around 0.1 to 0.2.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The current high securityRisk scores (mostly 0.95 or 1.0) are unreasonable for such static import code.\n- I suggest adjusting all risk scores to **0.1** for a conservative but accurate assessment, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Overall:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (per report) — adjusted for accuracy\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is benign, standard setup code for a web framework, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
