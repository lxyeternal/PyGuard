  "purpose": "Type annotations and import statements for a web framework's request and response handling, facilitating static type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing module, and conditional type checking imports for WSGIApplication, Headers, Response.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data processing or untrusted data handling; purely static type definitions.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only defines type aliases and imports without runtime execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for static type annotations in Python.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions, import statements, and conditional imports for static type checking. It does not process data, execute logic, or handle untrusted input. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of type variables, unions, and forward references is standard for such type annotation modules. The import statements are safe and typical for static type support. The scores assigned (malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are appropriate given the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard static type annotation module for a web framework, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware and security risk.",
