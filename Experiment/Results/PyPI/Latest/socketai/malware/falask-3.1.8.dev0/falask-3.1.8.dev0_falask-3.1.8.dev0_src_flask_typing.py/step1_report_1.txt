{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and type aliases for a web application framework, primarily for request/response handling, middleware, and callback functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from Python typing module, conditional imports for type checking, type alias definitions, and type variable declarations.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly executes or processes untrusted input; it only defines type annotations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows are established; the code is purely type annotation without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard for defining type hints and static type checking support in a web framework context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports and defines multiple type aliases and generics for HTTP response types, headers, callbacks, and other web framework constructs. Conditional imports are used for static type checking purposes only. There are no executable statements, network operations, or data processing that could be exploited maliciously. The structure and content are typical for a type hint module in a web framework, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign type annotation module for a web framework. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves to improve static type checking and code clarity.",
