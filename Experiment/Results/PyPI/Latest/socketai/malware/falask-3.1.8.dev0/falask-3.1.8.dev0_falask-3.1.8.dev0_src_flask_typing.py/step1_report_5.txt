{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations and type aliases for a web framework, likely Flask or Werkzeug, to specify the expected types of responses, headers, and callback functions used within the framework.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and imported modules such as 'typing', 'werkzeug.datastructures.Headers', 'werkzeug.sansio.response.Response', and conditional import of 'WSGIApplication'.",
  "sinks": "Type aliases and function signatures (e.g., ResponseReturnValue, AfterRequestCallable, BeforeRequestCallable) that could potentially process untrusted data if misused elsewhere, but no direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Type definitions establish expected data types; no runtime data flow or untrusted data processing occurs within this static code. The code only declares types and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code are present. The code is purely type annotations and import statements, with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for a web framework's response types, header types, and callback functions. It imports standard modules and third-party libraries related to web responses. There is no dynamic code execution, data handling, or logic that could be exploited. The imports and type aliases are standard for type hinting and do not pose security risks. The use of 't.Union' and other type hints is appropriate. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flow are evident. The code is purely declarative and for static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, standard set of type annotations for a web framework, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any runtime operations or handle untrusted data directly. The overall security risk is negligible.",
