  "purpose": "Define type annotations and type aliases for a web framework, likely Flask or Werkzeug, to specify various request, response, and callback function types.",
  "sources": "Type hints and annotations for various response, header, callback, and route function types; import statements for type checking.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No data flows or untrusted data handling are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines type annotations and import statements without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of type annotations, import statements, and type aliases. No suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for various web framework components such as responses, headers, callbacks, and routes. It uses conditional imports for type checking and defines multiple union types for flexible function signatures. No runtime logic, data handling, or execution paths are present. The code appears standard and intended solely for type safety and code clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard type annotation module for a Python web framework, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or execute runtime logic that could be exploited. It is a benign and typical part of a codebase intended for type checking.",
