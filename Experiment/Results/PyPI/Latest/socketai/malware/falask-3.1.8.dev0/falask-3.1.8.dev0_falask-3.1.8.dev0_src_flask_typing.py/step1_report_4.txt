{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and structure definitions for a web framework, specifically related to request/response handling and callback signatures.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type alias definitions, and type variable declarations.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no data processing, network communication, or data output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code mainly provides type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive use of type hints and forward references, but no signs of malicious code such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely dedicated to defining type aliases, import statements, and callable signatures for a web framework (likely Flask or Werkzeug). It does not execute any logic, handle user input, or perform network operations. The import statements are standard and do not pose a security risk. The type annotations facilitate static type checking and do not introduce runtime behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. Overall, the code appears to be a typical part of a larger codebase focused on type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotation module for a web framework, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is intended for static type checking and does not perform any runtime operations that could be malicious.",
