{
  "purpose": "This code defines type aliases, type variables, and callable signatures for a web framework, likely Flask or Werkzeug, to facilitate type checking and improve code clarity.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and imports at the beginning; type definitions throughout the code.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input processing are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code primarily establishes type structures; no runtime data flow or data handling occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes comprehensive type aliasing and conditional imports; no suspicious or unusual code behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely focused on type annotations and type safety definitions, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. It uses standard Python typing features to specify response types, headers, callbacks, and other web framework components. No hardcoded credentials, network communication, or security-sensitive operations are present. The use of conditional imports for type checking is common practice. Overall, this is a well-structured type annotation module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard type alias and interface definition for a web framework, with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves as a foundation for type safety and clarity in a larger application.",
