  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is solely dedicated to defining type aliases, imports, and annotations for a web framework, likely Flask or Werkzeug.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, or untrusted input handling is present.\n- The code uses standard Python typing practices, conditional imports for type checking, and no obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The scores assigned are consistently zero for malware and security risk, which aligns with the code's static and benign nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not process untrusted data directly; it only provides type hints.\n- No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscation are present.\n- The use of type variables, unions, and forward references is standard for such type annotation modules.\n- The import statements are safe and typical for static type checking support.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is justified.\n- The security risk score is 0, as there are no runtime operations or data handling.\n- The confidence score is 1, indicating high certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, benign type annotation module for a web framework.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary; they are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code is purely for static type checking, with no malicious or security-sensitive behavior. The reports are accurate and thorough in their assessment.",
