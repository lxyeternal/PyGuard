  "purpose": "Define a Blueprint class for a web framework, extending SansioBlueprint, to manage static files, resource access, and CLI commands.",
  "sources": "Configuration access (current_app.config), static folder and filename parameters, environment variables, method parameters, imported modules.",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory function call, open() system calls, access to static_folder and root_path paths.",
  "flows": "Configuration value (SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT) influences get_send_file_max_age, which affects send_from_directory parameters; filename parameter used in send_static_file and open_resource methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of open() without security checks for resource files is standard but should be noted for potential directory traversal if root_path is not validated (though not explicitly shown). No suspicious external network calls or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a subclass of SansioBlueprint with added methods for static file handling and resource access, as well as CLI integration. It reads configuration values from current_app.config, which is standard in Flask-like frameworks. The send_static_file method retrieves static files and applies max_age logic, and open_resource opens files for reading from the filesystem. The code does not contain any network connections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The overall structure and code are typical for a web framework blueprint class.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard framework code for managing static files and resources within a web application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The use of open() is safe in context, assuming root_path is validated elsewhere. Overall, it is a normal, non-malicious component.",
