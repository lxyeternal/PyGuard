{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Blueprint class for a Flask-like framework, managing static files, resources, and cache control, relying on configuration and filesystem operations.",
  "sources": "Configuration access via current_app.config; filename and resource parameters in methods; filesystem operations (open, send_from_directory).",
  "sinks": "Filesystem access through open() and send_from_directory; potential directory traversal if paths are not validated externally.",
  "flows": "Configuration values influence cache control; filename/resource parameters flow into filesystem functions for serving files.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard validation for modes; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard extension of Flask's Blueprint, with safe file handling and configuration access. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. Potential path traversal risks depend on external validation but are typical in such frameworks. The code's structure and logic are sound, with appropriate validation of modes and use of well-understood functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified, assuming proper validation of paths elsewhere. Malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, indicating a safe, standard implementation.",
