  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential security implications, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a custom `Blueprint` class for Flask-like applications.\n- Extends `SansioBlueprint`.\n- Adds methods for static file serving (`send_static_file`), cache control (`get_send_file_max_age`), and resource opening (`open_resource`).\n- Uses configuration values (`current_app.config`) and filesystem operations (`open`, `send_from_directory`).\n- No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no suspicious control flow.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Standard extension of Flask Blueprint, handling static files and resources.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Uses `current_app.config`, file operations, and `send_from_directory`.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward, safe, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The low risk score is appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, describing static/resource management.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Same as above.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as standard, safe, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Similar functionality, focusing on static/resource handling.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Same pattern.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the code as typical, safe, with no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Similar, emphasizing static files and resource management.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Same as above.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, standard framework extension.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1–0.2, Obfuscated 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The risk score could be slightly lower, perhaps 0.1, since no risky behaviors are observed. But 0.2 remains acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous, focusing on static/resource handling.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Same pattern.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the code as typical, with no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or supply chain issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n**Estimated scores based on the code:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since the code interacts with filesystem and configuration, but in a safe manner)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe extension of Flask's Blueprint for static file and resource management. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
