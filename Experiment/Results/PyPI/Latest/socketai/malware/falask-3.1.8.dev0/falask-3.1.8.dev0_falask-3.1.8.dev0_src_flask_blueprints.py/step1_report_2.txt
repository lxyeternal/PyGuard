{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Blueprint class for a web framework, extending functionality for static file serving, resource opening, and configuration management within a Flask-like application.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration values from 'current_app.config', user input from function parameters (filename, resource, mode), and imported modules (os, typing, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include 'send_from_directory' (serving static files), 'open' calls for resource files, and access to configuration data, particularly 'SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT'.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (filename, resource, mode) flow into 'send_static_file' and 'open_resource' methods, which then invoke 'send_from_directory' and 'open' respectively, with configuration values influencing behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual control flow are present. Use of 'current_app.config' is standard for configuration, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Flask extension, defining methods for static file serving, resource management, and configuration retrieval. It correctly uses safe practices, such as validating 'mode' in 'open_resource' and casting types where necessary. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flow is found. There are no obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected. The code is consistent with typical web framework extensions, with no malicious intent apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious extension for managing static files and resources within a Flask-like framework. There are no signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, with safe handling of inputs and configurations.",
