{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom Blueprint class for a Flask-like web framework, extending SansioBlueprint, with methods for static file handling, resource opening, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Configuration access via current_app.config, method parameters (filename, resource, mode), and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory function, open() calls, access to current_app.config, and class attributes like static_folder and root_path.",
  "flows": "Configuration value retrieval (current_app.config) influences send_static_file behavior; method parameters (filename, resource, mode) are used in open and send functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The use of open() is restricted to reading modes; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Blueprint class that handles static file serving, resource opening, and configuration management in a web application context. It accesses configuration values via current_app.config, which is standard. The methods enforce safe usage, such as restricting open modes to reading only. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. No suspicious network activity or malicious payloads are present. The code structure appears normal and in line with typical web framework practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, implementing standard web framework functionality with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It safely manages static files and resources with proper restrictions. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
