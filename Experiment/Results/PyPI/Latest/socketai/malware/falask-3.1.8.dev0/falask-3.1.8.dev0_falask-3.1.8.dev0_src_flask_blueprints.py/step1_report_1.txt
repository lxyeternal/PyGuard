{
  "purpose": "Define a custom Blueprint class for Flask applications, extending sansio blueprints, with methods for serving static files, managing cache age, and opening resources.",
  "sources": "Configuration access via current_app.config; input parameters such as filename, resource, mode, encoding.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (open), send_from_directory function, and response return which could potentially leak data or serve malicious files.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (filename, resource, mode, encoding) flow into file operations; configuration values influence cache settings; static file serving utilizes send_from_directory which reads from static folders.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code, no code that performs network communications or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward extension of Flask's Blueprint to include custom static file serving and resource opening functions. It uses configuration values and safe file handling practices. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of open() for resource files appears limited to reading and controlled by input parameters. No external network or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Flask extension for managing blueprints and static resources, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It mainly provides convenience methods for file serving and resource management.",
