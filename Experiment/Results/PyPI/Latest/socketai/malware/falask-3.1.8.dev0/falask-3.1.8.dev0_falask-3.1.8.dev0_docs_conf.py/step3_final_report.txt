  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation of the Flask project, setting up extensions, themes, links, and a custom role for GitHub source linking.",
  "sources": "get_version() function providing release/version info, environment data from app.config, user input from documentation content for URL construction.",
  "sinks": "URL construction in github_link function, referencing version info and user-provided text for link generation.",
  "flows": "get_version() supplies release info → github_link constructs URL based on release and text → URL used in documentation links.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious external calls. URL generation depends on trusted version info and documentation content, with no external data fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration with a custom role for linking to GitHub files. URL construction is based on trusted release data and documentation content, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or external network activity. The dynamic URL logic is safe given the trusted sources. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate; risk scores around 0.1-0.2 reflect minimal concern over URL generation based on version info, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and does not pose a supply chain security threat. The assigned scores are consistent with its behavior.",
