  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code configures Sphinx documentation, relying on imported functions (`get_version`) and environment data (`app.config`).\n- **Key Logic:** The custom role `github_link` constructs URLs based on version info and user input.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious external calls.\n- **Analysis:** The URL construction is safe, relying on trusted version data. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate; security risk 0.1 is minimal, given the dynamic URL creation but no external data fetching or code execution.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on documentation setup with dynamic URL generation.\n- **Key Logic:** The `github_link` function constructs URLs based on release info and text input.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** Slight concern about the trustworthiness of `release` info, but it's obtained via `get_version`, which is presumably trusted.\n- **Analysis:** The dynamic URL creation is standard for documentation tools. No external network activity or code execution.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is justified; security risk 0.2 is acceptable given the dynamic URL logic, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Configuration for Sphinx with a custom role for GitHub links.\n- **Key Logic:** Similar URL generation logic, based on version info and user input.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** The URL creation is safe and typical for documentation systems.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.2, consistent with the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard documentation setup with custom roles.\n- **Key Logic:** URL generation based on version info, with no external data fetching.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward configuration; no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0, appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar configuration with URL logic based on version info.\n- **Key Logic:** URL creation is standard, differentiating dev and release versions.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No hardcoded secrets, no external calls, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, consistent with the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns primarily related to dynamic URL generation, which is standard for documentation tools.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity or code.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — Slight concern about dynamic URL generation but justified as low risk.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — considering the dynamic URL construction based on trusted version info, the risk remains minimal.\n\n**Note:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured Sphinx configuration script with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
