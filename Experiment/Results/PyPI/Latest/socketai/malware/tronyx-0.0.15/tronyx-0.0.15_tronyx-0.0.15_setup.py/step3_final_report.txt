  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for configuring and distributing the package 'tronyx'.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external output processing.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Comment suggesting to add a comma, but code syntax is correct; no malicious or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, importing necessary modules, reading a local README file, and calling setup() with package info. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues. The assigned scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
