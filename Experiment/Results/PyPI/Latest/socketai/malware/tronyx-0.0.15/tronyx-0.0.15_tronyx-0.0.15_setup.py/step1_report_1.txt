  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'tronyx' Python package including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup functions, and package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Reading file content for description, then passing configuration to setup(), with no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected. The code appears to be standard package setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup functions, reads a local README.md file for long description, and defines package metadata and dependencies. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The 'install_requires' only includes 'requests', a common library. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard configuration file for package distribution.",
