  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'tronyx', including metadata, dependencies, and repository info.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long_description; no other external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not execute untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: read the README file -> configure package setup parameters -> do not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup utilities, reads a local README file for documentation, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All operations are typical for package configuration. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code flows. The code does not execute external commands or handle untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
