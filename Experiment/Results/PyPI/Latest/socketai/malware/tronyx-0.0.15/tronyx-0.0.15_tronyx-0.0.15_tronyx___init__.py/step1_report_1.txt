  "sources": "The code imports from a relative module within the package; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, with only an import statement. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports an item from a local module, which is a common practice in Python projects. There are no inputs, data processing, or suspicious patterns detected. As it is only an import statement, it does not perform any harmful actions by itself. Without additional context, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a typical part of Python code structure, serving to include functionality from a local module.",
