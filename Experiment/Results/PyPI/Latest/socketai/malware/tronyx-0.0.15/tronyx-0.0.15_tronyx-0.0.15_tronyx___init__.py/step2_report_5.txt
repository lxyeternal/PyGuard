  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement: `from .main import perm` (or similar). There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The code is minimal and typical in Python projects.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that this is a benign import statement.  \n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.  \n   - They correctly identify the absence of data flows, external communication, or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores Review & Justification:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious activity.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with a couple of reports assigning 0.1, likely due to the use of relative import syntax (`.main`) which could be slightly suspicious in some contexts but is common in package structures. Given the minimal code, these are reasonable.\n\n4. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores:**  \n   - Since the code only imports a component and no other actions are taken, higher risk scores are unwarranted.  \n   - The presence of relative import syntax alone does not imply malicious intent, unless combined with obfuscation or malicious code elsewhere.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about what `perm` does elsewhere.  \n   - They acknowledge that without additional context, there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code snippet and analysis.  \n   - The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is acceptable, given the potential (though unlikely) concern with relative imports in some malicious contexts, but overall, the evidence points to benign code.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues based solely on this snippet.  \n- The malware score should remain at 0.  \n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.  \n- The security risk score should be 0, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall consensus and the minimal nature of the code snippet.",
