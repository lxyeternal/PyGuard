  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'perm' from a relative module '.main'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports a module component.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import could be suspicious if part of obfuscated or malicious code, but is common in package structure.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import of 'perm' from the local module 'main'. There are no data inputs, external communications, or other operations. This minimal code fragment does not exhibit malicious behavior, nor does it contain obfuscation or suspicious constructs. Since it only imports a component, the potential for malicious activity depends on what 'perm' does elsewhere, but from this snippet alone, there are no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evident malicious behavior or security issues based solely on this snippet.",
