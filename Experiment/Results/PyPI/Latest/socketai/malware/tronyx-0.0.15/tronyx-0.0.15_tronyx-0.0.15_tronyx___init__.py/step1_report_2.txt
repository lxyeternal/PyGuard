  "purpose": "The code imports the 'perm' object or function from a module named 'main' within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module 'main'",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow present in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual language features, and no obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement, which is a common and benign Python construct. It does not involve any data input, processing, or output. The code relies on the 'main' module within the same package and imports 'perm', but provides no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Without additional context or code, it appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard practice in Python packaging and module structuring.",
