  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current directory, then send this data to multiple external URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system info, random.randint() for generating a number, base64 encoding of MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send data to external URLs, passing collected data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) is collected and encoded, then included in URL parameters, which are sent via HTTP GET requests to specified external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded external URLs with suspicious domains; encoding of MAC addresses with base64; no validation or sanitization of data before sending; attempt to send data to multiple external endpoints without any evident purpose. No clear user benefit, and the URLs do not correspond to legitimate services.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system-specific data, encodes MAC addresses, and constructs URLs pointing to potentially malicious domains. It then attempts to send this data silently via GET requests. The external URLs are suspicious and possibly malicious domains used for data exfiltration. The use of multiple URLs, encoding, and silent exception handling indicate an attempt to hide or obfuscate data collection activities. There are no signs of malicious payload execution or command execution, but the pattern of data collection and exfiltration is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for stealthy data collection and transmission to suspicious external domains. While it does not execute malicious payloads, its behavior resembles data exfiltration typical of spyware or tracking malware. The domains involved are suspicious, and the purpose of collecting system info and sending it to these URLs is not justified for legitimate software. Overall, the code exhibits high risk for malicious intent.",
