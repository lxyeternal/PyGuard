  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs for tracking or data collection.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), MAC addresses (via platform.system() and subprocess calls), and generates a random number (random.randint()).",
  "sinks": "URL requests to external domains using urllib.request.urlopen() with constructed URLs containing collected data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses, random number) is encoded and embedded as URL parameters, then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domains (e.g., oast.cn, oast.fun) suggests tracking or command-and-control activity. Base64 encoding of MAC addresses before transmission may indicate obfuscation. No explicit data exfiltration beyond system info, but the domains and data collection behavior are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code collects various system identifiers and encodes MAC addresses with base64, then sends this information via GET requests to third-party URLs that are potentially malicious or used for tracking. The URL patterns and domains resemble those used in red teaming, threat simulations, or malicious data exfiltration setups. No malicious payload execution or backdoors detected. The code is straightforward but exhibits behaviors typical of surveillance or tracking scripts. Use of subprocess for MAC address retrieval is consistent with normal system info collection but combined with external URL communication to suspicious domains raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script gathers system information and transmits it to known or suspicious external domains, indicating potential tracking or data exfiltration behavior. There are no signs of malicious payload execution, backdoors, or system damage, but the activity is privacy-invasive and could be used maliciously.",
