  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data to specific external URLs.",
  "sources": "Reading system info from platform, getpass, os, and subprocess; generating random number; encoding MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen calls that send data to external URLs with system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Data from get_mac_addresses and system info functions flow into URL parameters, which are then transmitted via HTTP GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external domains; encoding MAC addresses in base64 before transmission; no validation or encryption of data; silent exception handling. The URLs are not standard endpoints and are associated with potential malicious domains.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) and encodes the MAC addresses in base64. It constructs URLs pointing to suspicious external domains and sends the collected data via HTTP GET requests. The use of such domains and transmission of potentially sensitive data indicates possible malicious intent, such as reconnaissance or data exfiltration. The exception handling is silent, which could be used to mask failures or unwanted activity. The code appears to perform surveillance or data theft, especially considering the context of the URLs involved.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system identifiers and transmitting them to suspicious external domains without user consent or transparency. The encoded MAC addresses and use of covert URLs strongly suggest malicious intent, likely for surveillance, tracking, or data exfiltration.",
