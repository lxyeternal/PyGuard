  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to specified external URLs.",
  "sources": "Reading platform information (platform.system(), platform.node()), user credentials (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), MAC addresses via subprocess commands, and system environment.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via HTTP GET requests to external URLs using urllib.request.urlopen().",
  "flows": "System data (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) are collected, encoded, and then sent as URL parameters to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with obfuscated domain names, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and network requests to suspicious, non-standard domains. No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors, but the data collection and exfiltration pattern is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system details including hostname, user, current directory, and MAC addresses via platform-specific commands. MAC addresses are encoded with base64. The data is then sent to multiple external URLs through GET requests with parameters. The URLs are obscure and potentially malicious, designed for data exfiltration or tracking. No malicious code execution or destructive actions are present, but the behavior resembles a reconnaissance or info-stealing script. There is no indication of malicious payload execution or backdoors, but the external communication pattern is suspicious and could be used for tracking or exfiltration. No obfuscation of code structure is evident, and no malicious intent appears explicit beyond data collection and transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The script primarily collects system info and exfiltrates it to external servers, which is suspicious behavior in contexts where user consent and transparency are lacking. While it does not contain clear malware, the data exfiltration pattern and obfuscated external URLs suggest a potentially malicious or privacy-invasive intent. The overall security risk is moderate, warranting review before use.",
