  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'imageoi' Python package, including custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method in the CrazyInstallStrat class, which imports and executes main() from main.py after installation.",
  "sinks": "The call to main() in the custom install command, which could execute arbitrary code from main.py.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'install' command triggers CrazyInstallStrat.run(), which then imports and executes main() from main.py, potentially executing arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class automatically executes 'main()' from main.py post-install without any validation or security checks. No input validation or restrictions are present. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation command that, after completing standard installation steps, imports and executes 'main()' from a local module named main.py. This behavior is unusual because it runs arbitrary code during installation, which could be exploited to execute malicious code if main.py is compromised or maliciously modified. No other suspicious behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, network connections, or obfuscation, are detected. The code relies entirely on the contents of main.py to determine behavior, making it potentially dangerous if that module is malicious or compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The script executes arbitrary code from main.py during installation, which could be exploited for malicious purposes. This behavior is suspicious and warrants caution, especially if the source of main.py is untrusted.",
