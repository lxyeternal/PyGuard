  "conclusion": "The setup script executes external code ('main()') during installation, which is a high-risk behavior that could be malicious. While the code itself is simple and not obfuscated, this pattern is dangerous and should be treated with suspicion. The scores should reflect a high probability of malicious intent and security risk, given the potential for supply chain abuse."
