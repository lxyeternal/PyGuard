      "conclusion": "The setup script executes external code ('main()') during installation, which is a high-risk behavior that could be malicious. While the code itself is simple and not obfuscated, this pattern is dangerous and should be treated with suspicion. The scores should reflect a high probability of malicious intent and security risk, given the potential for supply chain abuse."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a data collection and exfiltration script with suspicious external URLs. It does not contain malicious payloads or destructive actions but exhibits behaviors typical of spyware or reconnaissance tools. The scores should reflect moderate malware suspicion (~0.5) and high security risk (~0.7-0.8). The activity pattern justifies a cautious stance, emphasizing the need for further analysis of external domains and potential payloads."
