{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to gather system information and send it to a specified server endpoint.",
  "sources": "Data sources include socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), and subprocess.check_output(['ls']).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data is sent via requests.get() to an external IP address, potentially leaking sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Collected system data flows from sources (hostname, cwd, username, ls_output) to the network request sink in requests.get().",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to execute 'ls' and send its output along with system info to an external IP without user consent; IP address hardcoded; no validation or encryption.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system details including hostname, current directory, username, and output of 'ls'. These are assembled into a payload and transmitted to a remote server. The data collection occurs during the custom installation process, which could be malicious if done without user knowledge or consent. The IP address appears to be a private or malicious server. No obfuscation or encryption is used. The code’s intent seems to be gathering environment info for possibly malicious purposes such as surveillance or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to intentionally collect sensitive system information and exfiltrate it to an external server during package installation, indicating malicious behavior. The hardcoded IP address and data transmission without user approval are suspicious.",
