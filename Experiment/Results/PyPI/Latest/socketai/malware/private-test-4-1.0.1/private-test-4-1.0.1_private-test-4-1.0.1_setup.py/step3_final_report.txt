    "Data exfiltration occurs during package installation"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code performs system information collection and directory listing during installation, then transmits this data to an external IP address via an HTTP GET request. No obfuscation is present. The behavior indicates an attempt at data exfiltration, likely malicious, especially given the lack of user consent and the hardcoded external IP. The code's actions resemble spyware or backdoor activity, raising high security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through data exfiltration during package installation, with high confidence. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, with malware score around 0.85 and security risk near 0.9, reflecting the serious privacy invasion and potential backdoor activity.",
