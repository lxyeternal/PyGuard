  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it to a specified server.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), username (getpass.getuser()), and output of 'ls' command (subprocess.check_output).",
  "sinks": "requests.get() function sending data to an external IP address, potentially exfiltrating sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, cwd, username, ls output) collected during installation flow, then transmitted via HTTP GET request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to run 'ls' and collect its output, then immediately sending this data externally. Hardcoded external IP address (192.198.82.14:3000) without clear legitimate purpose, and data collection during installation. No user consent or notification.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the standard setuptools installation process by defining a custom install class. During installation, it executes 'ls' to list directory contents, retrieves system info (hostname, current directory, username), and sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a specific IP address. The external server's IP and port suggest suspicious activity, possibly data exfiltration or reconnaissance. The data collection occurs without user knowledge or consent, and the collected information includes potentially sensitive system details. No encryption or obfuscation is used when sending data. The code does not contain typical obfuscation techniques but performs actions that resemble malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent by collecting system information during installation and transmitting it to an external server without user consent. This pattern resembles data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior. No benign justification for such data collection is evident.",
