  "purpose": "The script customizes the installation process to collect system information and send it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), subprocess.check_output(['ls'])",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with data containing hostname, cwd, username, and ls_output",
  "flows": "source functions (hostname, cwd, username, ls_output) -> data dictionary -> requests.get() to remote server",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of subprocess to execute 'ls' during installation; sending system info to an external IP without clear purpose; hardcoded IP address",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to execute 'ls' and gather system info such as hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious IP address. This behavior is unusual during package installation, especially with no user consent, and resembles data exfiltration or system reconnaissance. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present beyond data collection. The IP address appears arbitrary and potentially malicious. The use of subprocess and the timing of data transmission raise concerns about privacy invasion or malicious tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection during package installation and transmits this data to an external server without user consent, indicating potentially malicious behavior. No obfuscated or malicious payloads are present, but the behavior is suspicious and could compromise user privacy.",
