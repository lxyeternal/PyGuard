{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that performs a custom installation process, including executing system commands and sending system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), username (getpass.getuser()), and output of 'ls' command (subprocess.check_output).",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data via an HTTP GET request to 'http://192.198.82.14:3000/log' using the requests library.",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, username, ls_output) flow into the 'ploads' dictionary, which is then sent over the network through requests.get to the specified URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, directory, directory listing) and exfiltrates it to an external IP address without any user consent or notification. The target IP address is suspicious, and the data exfiltration occurs during installation, which is unusual behavior for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the setuptools installation process by executing 'ls' to list directory contents and gathering system information (hostname, username, current directory). It then sends this data to an external IP address via a GET request. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, possibly malicious, especially considering the absence of user awareness or consent. The IP address used appears suspicious and untrusted. There are no obfuscation techniques or malicious payloads like code injection, reverse shells, or malicious files, but the unauthorized collection and transmission of system data are concerning. The script's purpose appears malicious or at least highly suspicious due to privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly collecting system information and exfiltrating it to a remote server during installation. This indicates a potential supply chain attack or malicious package intended to spy on users' systems. The overall security risk is high, and the behavior should be reviewed thoroughly before use.",
