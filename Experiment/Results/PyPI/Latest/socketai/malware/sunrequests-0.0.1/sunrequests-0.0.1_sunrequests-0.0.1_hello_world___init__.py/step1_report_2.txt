  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but the specific goal is unclear without additional context.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly visible; there are no obvious data input functions, file reads, or network data retrieval in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that could execute system commands or process data, but none are clearly identified as untrusted data handling points within this code segment.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flow pathways are evident; the code primarily consists of definitions and simple operations without involving external data inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code patterns. The code appears straightforward with standard constructs. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, lacking external data inputs, network interactions, or system modifications. It contains no suspicious or malicious patterns. Without additional context or external data, the code does not demonstrate malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security vulnerabilities. It appears safe and benign in its current form.",
