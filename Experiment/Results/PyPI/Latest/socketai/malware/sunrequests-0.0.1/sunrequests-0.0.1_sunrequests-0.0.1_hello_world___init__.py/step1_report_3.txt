  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but without additional context, it is unclear whether it has any malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment variables, imports standard and third-party modules, and potentially reads files or network data (if present in the full code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, or data storage, but specific sinks cannot be confirmed without detailed code content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input files to sinks like network or file output, but detailed flow paths are unclear without full code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are evident in the provided fragment. No obfuscated code features or malicious constructs are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard imports, no suspicious imports or obfuscated functions are detected. No hardcoded secrets or dangerous functions (like exec, eval with untrusted input) are present. Without additional code, no malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and benign, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
