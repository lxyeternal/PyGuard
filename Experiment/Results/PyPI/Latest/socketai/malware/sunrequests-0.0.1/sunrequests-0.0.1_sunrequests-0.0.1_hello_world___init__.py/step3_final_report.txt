{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign utility or data processing script with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, modules, stdin, env, file, user input",
  "sinks": "Potential outputs to system, network, or files, but no explicit untrusted data sinks identified",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables, stdin, or files to processing functions; no malicious or suspicious flows detected",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and lacks suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code reads inputs from environment variables, stdin, or files, but these are typical in utility scripts. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified by the minimal potential attack surface, and malware score (0) aligns with the benign assessment. Confidence is high (0.9) due to the clear, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware score should remain at 0. Overall, the code poses minimal security concerns.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
