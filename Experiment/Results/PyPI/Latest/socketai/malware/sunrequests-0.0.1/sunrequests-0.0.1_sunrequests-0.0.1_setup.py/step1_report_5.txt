{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package for distribution via setuptools, including reading the README file for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, importing setuptools, and calling setuptools.setup() with metadata and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that could lead to data leaks or code execution. The setup() function is used for package configuration, not for executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Read file input from README.md → Pass metadata to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard package setup tasks without suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a well-known packaging library (setuptools), reads a README file, and calls setup() with package metadata. All operations are typical for Python package distribution. No user input is processed, no untrusted data flows, and no suspicious code behaviors are present. Commented out dependencies do not introduce security risks. The code appears straightforward and adheres to common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious elements. It functions solely to package and distribute a Python project with no evident security concerns.",
