  "anomalies": "None; commented dependencies are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, reads a local README.md for long_description, and calls setuptools.setup() with static, hardcoded metadata. No dynamic input, external data, or untrusted sources are involved. The commented-out requirements line is harmless. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code performs only standard package configuration tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard packaging code with no malicious intent or security issues. It reads only a local file, with no external or untrusted data processing, and contains no suspicious or obfuscated code.",
