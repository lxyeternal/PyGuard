{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'sunrequests', used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, package discovery via setuptools.find_packages().",
  "targets": "No untrusted input sources; the script primarily uses static data and file reading.",
  "flows": "N/A, as no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The commented-out 'requirements' variable is benign and standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for packaging Python code. It reads a README file to set a long description, specifies package metadata, and calls setuptools.setup() with static arguments. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. No external inputs, network activity, or insecure practices are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
