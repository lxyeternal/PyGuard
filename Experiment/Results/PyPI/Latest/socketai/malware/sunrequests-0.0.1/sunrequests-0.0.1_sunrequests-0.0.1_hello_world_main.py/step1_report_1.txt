{
  "purpose": "The code extracts saved login credentials from various browsers (Chrome, Opera, Edge, Firefox), decrypts them, and sends the data via Telegram. It also retrieves the system's IP address.",
  "sources": "Reads local browser data files, including 'Local State' files and 'logins.json' in Firefox profiles. It reads environment variables for user profile paths.",
  "sinks": "Sends extracted credentials as CSV files to a Telegram bot via HTTP POST requests. Writes decrypted passwords and login info to files before transmission.",
  "flows": "Reads browser data -> decrypts stored passwords -> writes credentials to CSV files -> sends files over network to Telegram API.",
  "anomalies": "Code is designed to access and decrypt saved browser passwords without user consent, indicating potentially malicious intent. Uses win32crypt and AES decryption for password recovery. Sends data to an external server (Telegram). The use of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID is suspicious. The code does not perform any user interaction or validation. Exception handling is broad and silent, hiding errors. No user prompts or notifications are present, which is unusual for legitimate credential recovery tools.",
  "analysis": "The script automates the extraction and decryption of stored browser passwords from Chrome, Opera, Edge, and Firefox profiles. It reads sensitive data from local browser storage, decrypts encrypted passwords using system-specific methods (win32crypt and AES), and then compiles the credentials into CSV files. The files are subsequently sent over the internet to a Telegram bot, using hardcoded API credentials. The code is structured to operate silently, with minimal error reporting. The purpose appears to be collecting user credentials without user consent, and the method of exfiltration indicates malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a credential stealer, harvesting stored passwords from browsers and transmitting them to an external server (Telegram). It does not perform any user notification or validation, suggesting malicious intent. The use of system-specific decryption methods and the exfiltration mechanism strongly indicate malicious behavior.",
