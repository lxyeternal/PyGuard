{
  "purpose": "The code extracts saved login credentials from browsers (Chrome, Opera, Edge, Firefox), decrypts them, and sends the collected data via Telegram, potentially for malicious data theft.",
  "sources": "Reads browser profiles, login databases, and logins.json files; reads local state files for secret keys; reads environment variables for user profile paths.",
  "sinks": "Writes decrypted credentials to CSV files; sends these files over the network to a Telegram bot using the Telegram API.",
  "flows": "Sources include browser profile directories and login files; decryption functions process encrypted data; decrypted credentials are written to CSV files; files are then transmitted via send_to_telegram function over HTTP POST to Telegram API.",
  "anomalies": "Contains hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, which is a security risk and indicative of malicious intent. The code copies browser login databases for decryption, which can be suspicious. No user prompts or warnings are present, indicating stealthy operation.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically extracts login credentials from popular browsers by accessing profile data, decrypting stored passwords using platform-specific methods, and compiling the data into CSV files. It then automatically uploads these files to a Telegram account using hardcoded API tokens. The presence of hardcoded credentials, silent decryption, and data exfiltration points strongly suggest malicious intent. No user consent, obfuscation, or protective measures are evident. Overall, the code appears designed to steal sensitive user data covertly.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by harvesting stored browser credentials and exfiltrating them via Telegram. The presence of hardcoded API tokens, silent data collection, and decryption routines indicate it functions as a credential stealer. It should be considered highly malicious and potentially dangerous.",
