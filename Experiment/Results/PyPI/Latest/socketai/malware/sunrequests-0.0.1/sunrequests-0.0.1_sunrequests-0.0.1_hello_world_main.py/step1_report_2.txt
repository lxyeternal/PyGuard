{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract stored login credentials (URLs, usernames, and passwords) from various browsers (Chrome, Opera, Edge, Firefox) on the system, decrypt them, and send the data via Telegram.",
  "sources": "It reads browser data files such as 'Local State' for Chrome/Edge, 'logins.json' for Firefox, and 'Login Data' SQLite databases for Chrome/Opera/Edge. It also reads environment variables and system hostname.",
  "sinks": "It writes decrypted credentials to CSV files and then uploads these files to a Telegram chat via the Telegram Bot API.",
  "flows": "Sources include browser data files and environment variables; flows involve reading encrypted data, decrypting it using system secrets or cryptographic keys, writing decrypted data to CSV files, and transmitting these files over the network to Telegram.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, which is suspicious. It copies and deletes browser login databases without user consent, indicating possible data exfiltration. No user prompts or permissions are present. The script runs silently, catching all exceptions without logging or alerting.",
  "analysis": "The script automates the extraction of saved credentials from multiple browsers by locating their data directories, decrypts passwords using OS-specific methods (Windows cryptography APIs), and saves the information to CSV files. It then sends these files via Telegram. Hardcoded credentials for Telegram and silent exception handling are indicators of malicious intent. The code does not include any user interaction, logging, or opt-out mechanisms, and it operates stealthily, which are typical behaviors of malware targeting credential theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to steal stored login credentials from popular browsers and exfiltrate them via Telegram. It exhibits malicious behavior through unauthorized access, decryption, and transmission of sensitive user data without consent. The presence of hardcoded credentials and silent failure handling further supports malicious intent.",
