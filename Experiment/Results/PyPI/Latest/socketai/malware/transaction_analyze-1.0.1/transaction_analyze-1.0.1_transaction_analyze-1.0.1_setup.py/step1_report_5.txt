  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the 'transaction_analyze' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package information and a list for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no data leaks or external interactions occur.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted input data to sensitive functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "License specified as 'Python Script' which is unconventional; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses standard setuptools syntax to specify package name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies. Dependencies include 'blessings' with a version specifier and 'pytest' as a dev dependency. No external data inputs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The license field is non-standard but not malicious. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
