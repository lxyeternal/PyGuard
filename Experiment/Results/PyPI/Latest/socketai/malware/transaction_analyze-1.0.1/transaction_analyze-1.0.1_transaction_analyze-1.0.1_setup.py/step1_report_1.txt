  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'transaction_analyze'.",
  "sources": "Input sources are the parameters provided to the setup() function, such as package name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the installation of dependencies listed in install_requires and extras_require, which could introduce malicious packages if those dependencies are compromised.",
  "flows": "The setup() function reads metadata and dependency lists, which are then used during package installation. There are no dynamic or external data flows that could be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The license field is set to 'Python Script', which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It does not contain any dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The dependencies are common, and the structure follows typical packaging conventions. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate, with no indications of malicious intent. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
