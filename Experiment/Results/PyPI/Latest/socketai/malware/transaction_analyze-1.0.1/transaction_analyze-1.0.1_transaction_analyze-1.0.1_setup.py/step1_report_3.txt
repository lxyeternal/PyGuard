  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'transaction_analyze'.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function: package name, version, description, author, license, dependencies, and extras.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input are present; the code only defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration without external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; standard setup script for a Python package with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with package metadata and dependency specifications. Dependencies include 'blessings' version approximately 1.7 and 'pytest' for development. No code execution, data input, or untrusted data handling occurs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. The license 'Python Script' is non-standard but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical package setup configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
