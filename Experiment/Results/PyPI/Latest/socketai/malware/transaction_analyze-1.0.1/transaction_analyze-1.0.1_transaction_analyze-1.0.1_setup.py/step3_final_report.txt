  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static parameters within setup() such as name, version, description, packages, author, license, install_requires, extras_require.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input is processed.",
  "flows": "None; static configuration without dynamic data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional license string 'Python Script', but no malicious implications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script configuring package metadata and dependencies. It contains no dynamic code, external data inputs, or suspicious behaviors. Dependencies are common packages, and the license field, while non-standard, does not pose security issues. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with the minor risk due to the unusual license label.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the security risk score can be set to 0 given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
