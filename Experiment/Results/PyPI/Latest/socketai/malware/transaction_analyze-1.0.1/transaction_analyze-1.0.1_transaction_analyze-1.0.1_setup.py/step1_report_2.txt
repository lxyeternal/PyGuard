  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'transaction_analyze' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Code reads static package metadata and dependencies specified as strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines static setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The license 'Python Script' is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses 'setuptools' to define package setup parameters, including name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies. All data are static strings, and dependencies are standard. No code execution, user input handling, or dynamic behavior is present. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures identified.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
