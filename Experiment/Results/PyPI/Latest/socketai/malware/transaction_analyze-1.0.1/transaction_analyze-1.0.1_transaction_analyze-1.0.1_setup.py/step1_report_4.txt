  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'transaction_analyze' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static values assigned to parameters within the setup() function, such as package name, version, description, author, license, dependencies, and extras.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or user inputs; no sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; all data are static configurations for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "License specified as 'Python Script', which is unconventional and may not be a valid license. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to configure package metadata and dependencies. It specifies package info, dependencies, and extras. The license field is unusual but not malicious. No code execution, data leaks, or malicious actions are present. The dependencies are standard and benign. No suspicious or malicious code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a typical package setup configuration without any malicious behavior or security risks. The only unusual element is the license field value, which may be a mislabel but does not introduce security issues.",
