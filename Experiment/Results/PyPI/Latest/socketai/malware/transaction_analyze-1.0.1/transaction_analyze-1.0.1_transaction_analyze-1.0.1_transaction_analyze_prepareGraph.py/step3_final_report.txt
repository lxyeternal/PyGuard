  "purpose": "Injects JSON data into a JavaScript variable for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "json_dump parameter used in prepareGraph to generate JS code.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a .js file; injecting json_dump directly into JavaScript code.",
  "flows": "json_dump is concatenated into a string and written into a JS file, potentially leading to code injection if untrusted.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation; commented code for HTML manipulation is benign; no suspicious external calls or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly serializes JSON data into a JavaScript variable and writes it to a file. The primary concern is that 'json_dump' is injected directly without sanitization, which could allow script injection if 'json_dump' is untrusted. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious network activity is evident. The functions for data fetching and plotting are standard and benign. The commented code is inactive and harmless. The injection point warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally benign, performing typical data serialization for visualization. The main security risk stems from injecting untrusted 'json_dump' into JavaScript without sanitization, which could lead to script injection if 'json_dump' is malicious. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk is moderate, approximately 0.3, due to potential injection vulnerability.",
