  "malware_score": 0.75,
  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates multiple indicators of malicious behavior, including dynamic code execution, obfuscated external URL handling, and cryptographic functions that could be exploited for covert activities. Given these factors, it warrants a high malware score and caution in supply chain contexts."
