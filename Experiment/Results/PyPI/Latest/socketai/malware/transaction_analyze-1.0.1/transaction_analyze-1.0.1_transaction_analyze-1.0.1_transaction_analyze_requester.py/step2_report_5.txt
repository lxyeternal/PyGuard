  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues identified:**\n  - Re-initialization of `processed_transactions` each loop iteration prevents tracking previously processed transactions, leading to duplicate notifications.\n  - Missing imports (`time`, `datetime`, `winsound`) would cause runtime errors.\n  - Use of `transaction['result']` without verifying key existence could cause KeyError if data is malformed.\n  - The `requester` function is unused.\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code is benign, focused on monitoring, with no malicious behavior.\n  - The logical flaw regarding transaction processing is significant but does not introduce security risk.\n  - The missing imports are technical errors, not security issues.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - Security risk: 0.2 (slightly elevated due to code quality issues, but no real security threat)\n- **Justification for scores:**\n  - The low security risk score is appropriate; no malware or obfuscation.\n  - The logical flaw is a bug, not a security concern.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep scores as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues:**\n  - No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n  - The only concern is the hardcoded sound file, which is operational, not malicious.\n  - No vulnerabilities or malware detected.\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code is straightforward, benign, and designed for wallet monitoring.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - Security risk: 0.1 (appropriate, minimal operational concern)\n- **Justification:**\n  - No security issues or malware, just operational considerations.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep scores as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues:**\n  - Re-initialization of `processed_transactions` each iteration prevents persistent transaction tracking.\n  - Missing imports (`time`, `datetime`, `winsound`).\n  - The `requester` function is unused.\n  - No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code is benign, with some implementation flaws.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0.2 (low, operational concern)\n- **Justification:**\n  - No malware or obfuscation; flaws are bugs.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep scores as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues:**\n  - The `requester` function constructs URLs from unvalidated input, which could lead to SSRF if misused.\n  - The code is otherwise benign.\n  - No malware detected.\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The URL construction could be a security concern if inputs are untrusted.\n  - The main monitoring code is standard.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0.2 (due to potential URL injection)\n- **Justification:**\n  - While not malware, the URL handling is a minor security concern if inputs are untrusted.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep scores as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues:**\n  - No obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n  - Slight operational concern with the static sound file, but not malicious.\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code is a standard wallet monitor.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0.2\n- **Justification:**\n  - No security issues or malware.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep scores as is.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low (0.1-0.2), reflecting operational concerns or minor bugs, but no security threats.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent with reports)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (slight operational concerns, such as URL validation, missing imports, and transaction tracking bugs)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The main security concern is the URL construction in the `requester` function, which could be exploited if untrusted input is used. However, in the context of these reports, the code is primarily monitoring wallets with no malicious intent. The bugs are technical and do not elevate the security risk significantly.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2             |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the evidence presented.",
