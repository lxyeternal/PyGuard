{
  "purpose": "Monitor specified cryptocurrency wallets for balance changes and transactions, log events, and alert via sound notifications.",
  "sources": "API responses from blockchain.info for each wallet; local file for logging; external sound file for notifications.",
  "sinks": "Writing logs to a file; printing to console; playing sound via winsound.",
  "flows": "API response data flows from requests.get to JSON parsing, then to balance and transaction processing, with outputs to logs and notifications.",
  "anomalies": "Re-initialization of 'processed_transactions' each cycle causes duplicate processing; missing imports ('time', 'datetime', 'winsound'); unused 'requester' function; hardcoded sound filename.",
  "analysis": "The code monitors wallets by polling an external API, detects balance and transaction changes, and logs/alerts accordingly. Logical flaw: 'processed_transactions' set resets each cycle, leading to duplicate notifications. Missing imports would cause runtime errors but are not security issues. The 'requester' function constructs URLs from input but is unused, posing no active threat. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration observed. External sound file and API calls are typical for such scripts. Overall, the code is benign but has implementation flaws that do not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward, benign wallet monitoring tool with some logical and implementation flaws. No malware or obfuscation detected. Security risk is low (~0.2) due to bugs, but no active threats are present.",
