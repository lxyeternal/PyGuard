  "purpose": "This code checks for the presence of a file and, if missing, downloads and installs the Quark tool from GitHub to assist with graph visualization.",
  "sources": "os.listdir(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "os.system() commands executing git clone and move operations, os.remove()",
  "flows": "Detection of missing 'quark.html' triggers system calls to clone repository, move files, and delete directories",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.system() to execute shell commands including cloning a repository and moving/removing files, which can be manipulated if inputs are altered (though here inputs are static). No hardcoded credentials or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The script checks if 'quark.html' exists in the current directory. If not, it clones a GitHub repository containing Quark, moves some files into the current directory, deletes the cloned repository, and reports success. The use of os.system() for shell commands is standard but can pose security risks if inputs are manipulated. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident beyond the potentially risky use of system calls. The repository URL is hardcoded and static. The overall behavior appears to be installing a visualization tool, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a setup operation to ensure Quark is available for graph visualization. No malicious intent or malware signs are present. The use of system calls is typical for such install scripts, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
