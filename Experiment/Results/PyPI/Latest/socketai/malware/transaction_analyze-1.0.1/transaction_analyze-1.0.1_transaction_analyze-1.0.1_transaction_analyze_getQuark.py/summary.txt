  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no embedded malware or malicious intent. Its primary security concern is the reliance on external repositories without validation, which introduces supply chain risk. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the security risk around 0.5 to 0.6 to account for potential exploitation if the external source is compromised."
