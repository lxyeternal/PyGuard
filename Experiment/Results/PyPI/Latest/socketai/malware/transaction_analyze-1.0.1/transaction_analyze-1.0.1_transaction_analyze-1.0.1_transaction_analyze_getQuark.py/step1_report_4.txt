  "purpose": "Download and set up the Quark tool if it is not already present in the current directory.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() for checking existing files, os.system() commands to clone and move files from a GitHub repository.",
  "sinks": "os.system() commands executing shell commands, including cloning repositories and moving files.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'quark.html' -> executes 'git clone' -> moves files -> deletes the cloned repo.",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.system() with unsanitized commands, which could be exploited if input is manipulated, but here inputs are static. No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for a specific file ('quark.html') in the current directory. If missing, it clones a GitHub repository 'https://github.com/s0md3v/Quark' using os.system(). It then moves certain files from the cloned repository into the current directory and deletes the remaining cloned directory. The process is straightforward but involves executing system commands that could be risky if inputs were dynamic; here, commands are static and controlled. The use of 'git clone' and file moves is standard for setup scripts, with no evident malicious behavior or malicious payloads. The code does not exfiltrate data or execute malicious actions beyond setting up a tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a setup operation to download and prepare the Quark tool if it's not already present. There is no malicious intent or malicious code embedded. The use of os.system() is a potential security concern if inputs are not controlled, but in this context, commands are static. Overall, this appears to be a benign setup script with no malicious behavior.",
