  "purpose": "Convert JSON data into a GraphML XML format if filename ends with '.graphml', otherwise return pretty-printed JSON.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'filename' and 'jsoned'.",
  "sinks": "Returning formatted GraphML string or JSON string. No untrusted data is written externally or to network.",
  "flows": "Input 'filename' and 'jsoned' are processed; if conditions are met, data flows into string formatting; otherwise, data is returned as JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data formatting: it constructs a GraphML string based on 'jsoned' data if the filename ends with '.graphml'. The loop constructs are standard string concatenations, converting 'nodes' and 'edges' data into XML format. The only potential concern is the use of string interpolation without sanitization, but this is typical in formatting code. No external calls, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The code doesn't handle untrusted inputs insecurely, nor does it include malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data formatting utility without any malicious intent or security risks. It straightforwardly transforms JSON to GraphML format or returns JSON. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
