  "purpose": "Convert JSON data representing nodes and edges into GraphML format or return the JSON data as a string if the filename does not end with '.graphml'.",
  "sources": "jsoned['nodes'], jsoned['edges'], filename",
  "sinks": "string formatting operations, return statement",
  "flows": "jsoned['nodes'] and jsoned['edges'] data -> string formatting -> return output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Usage of string formatting with data from jsoned, but no malicious impact evident.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the filename extension; if it ends with '.graphml', it constructs an XML string representing a graph from the provided JSON structure, including nodes and edges. The node and edge data are inserted into the XML via string interpolation, converting numeric values to floats. If the filename does not end with '.graphml', it returns the JSON data as a formatted string. The code operates solely on data passed to it and performs typical string concatenation and data formatting. There are no signs of malicious code, external network activity, or dangerous behavior. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data format conversion utility with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It processes input data into a different format without external dependencies or hidden behaviors.",
