  "purpose": "Terminal color configuration based on OS detection to enhance output readability.",
  "sources": "sys.platform, platform.platform(), platform.version()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only setting variables for terminal output",
  "flows": "OS detection -> setting 'colors' flag -> defining color escape sequences",
  "anomalies": "Potential assumption that platform.version() always has at least three parts; use of os.system('')' as workaround",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system and version to decide whether to enable colored terminal output. It disables colors on Windows, macOS, and iOS, unless Windows 10 version >= 10586, where it attempts to enable ANSI sequences via os.system(''). Color variables are set accordingly. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. Minor robustness issues exist in version parsing, but no security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, primarily handling terminal output formatting based on OS detection. No malicious intent or security risks are detected. The main concern is robustness in version parsing, but overall, the code is safe and straightforward.",
