  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process that customizes the installation step.",
  "sources": "Requests library for HTTP GET request; socket for hostname; getpass for username; os for current working directory.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call transmitting system information (hostname, current working directory, username) to an external URL.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code collects system data and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits system-specific information (hostname, cwd, username) to a remote URL during installation without user consent, which is unusual and suspicious. The URL appears to be a potential C2 or data collection server, especially given the comment about replacing it with other suspicious domains.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation class that overrides the run method. After executing the standard install process, it gathers system details: hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends these details to a remote server via an HTTP GET request using the requests library. The URL used for data transmission appears suspicious, as it does not belong to a typical trusted domain and is noted to be replaceable with known malicious domains (e.g., burpcollaborator.net). The behavior indicates data exfiltration during installation, which is a security concern. The rest of the setup code is standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, specifically data exfiltration of system information during package installation. This behavior is suspicious and indicates a security risk. The rest of the setup code is standard package configuration.",
