{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to define a Python package setup process with a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname via socket.gethostname(), current working directory via os.getcwd(), and username via getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to an external URL with collected system information (hostname, cwd, username).",
  "flows": "System info sources are collected and sent via requests.get to an external URL during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects sensitive system information and exfiltrates it to an external server without user consent. The URL used for data exfiltration appears suspicious and is hardcoded. The code executes this action during package installation, which is intrusive.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and additional modules for network and system info collection. A custom install class is defined that overrides the run method to perform the usual installation and then exfiltrate system details. The exfiltration occurs via a GET request to a suspicious external domain, which is indicative of potential data leakage or malicious activity. The purpose appears malicious, as it covertly collects system data during package installation without user awareness or consent. The code does not perform any other malicious actions such as executing commands, modifying files, or establishing persistent connections, but the exfiltration behavior alone is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior through the covert collection and exfiltration of system information during installation. The intent seems malicious, and it poses a security risk due to data leakage without user consent.",
