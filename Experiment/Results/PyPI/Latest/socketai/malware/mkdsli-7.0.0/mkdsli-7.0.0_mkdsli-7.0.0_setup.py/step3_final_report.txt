{
  "purpose": "The code performs a covert data exfiltration during package installation by sending system information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), username (getpass.getuser())",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to external URL with collected data as parameters",
  "flows": "Data is collected after the standard install run and sent via requests.get() to the specified URL",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration occurs during package installation without user consent; URL is suspicious; code is straightforward but performs covert activity",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, after executing the normal installation, gathers system info and sends it to an external server. The URL appears malicious or suspicious. The behavior is clearly covert data exfiltration, which is malicious. The code is not obfuscated, and no other malicious payloads are present. The data transmission is silent and occurs during installation, indicating malicious intent. The signals include data collection from system variables and network transmission to a suspicious domain. The activity violates user privacy and could facilitate further malicious actions. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.75-0.8, security risk 0.75-0.85) are appropriate, but considering the severity, the malware score should be increased to 0.8, and overall risk to 0.85.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious covert data exfiltration during package installation, with high potential privacy and security implications. The existing reports correctly identify this behavior; scores should be slightly adjusted upward to reflect the severity. It should be flagged as malicious until remediated.",
