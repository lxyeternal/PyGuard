{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process that includes a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "The data collected is sent via an HTTP GET request to an external URL (http://qpaw5pjg.requestrepo.com).",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, cwd, username) flows into the requests.get() call as URL parameters, sending potentially sensitive information to an external server during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system information during package installation without user consent. The URL used is suspicious and resembles a command-and-control or testing server. No validation or user prompts are present before data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities from setuptools and extends the install command with a custom run method. During installation, it collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then transmits this data to an external URL via an HTTP GET request. This behavior can be used for malicious tracking or data exfiltration. No other malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation is present. The URL looks suspicious and may be used to monitor or gather system info surreptitiously. The code is straightforward but includes a privacy-invasive action during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent. This is suspicious and potentially harmful, constituting a security risk.",
