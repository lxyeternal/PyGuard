{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process with a custom post-installation script.",
  "sources": "The requests library, platform module, and URL construction within the send() function.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call that sends data to a webhook URL, potentially leaking system info.",
  "flows": "The send() function is called during installation, collecting system info and sending it to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "The send() function transmits system hostname, OS, and IP address to an external webhook during install without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package setup, with a custom install command that executes the send() function after installation. The send() function gathers system hostname and OS info via platform module, retrieves external IP via requests.get('https://api.ipify.org'), and then constructs a URL to send this data to a specified webhook URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration. The code does not appear to have obfuscated parts or typical malicious code structures but performs an action that could be considered malicious or privacy-invasive. The primary concern is the automatic transmission of system data during package installation, which could be used for tracking or malicious data collection without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a post-installation script that exfiltrates system information to an external webhook, which is suspicious and could be malicious. This behavior indicates privacy invasion or malicious intent, especially since it operates silently during package installation without user consent.",
