{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup with a custom post-installation step that sends system information to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' to retrieve external IP address, and a constructed URL with system node and OS info for a GET request.",
  "sinks": "Requests sent to a webhook URL constructed with system data, which can potentially leak user/system information.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, OS, external IP) is collected, concatenated into a URL, and a GET request is made to send this data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The post-install script automatically transmits system information to a remote URL without user consent, which is unusual behavior. The use of platform data combined with an external IP for external communication during installation is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses 'setuptools' to define a package. It overrides the install command to include a 'send' function, which prints a message and then performs two HTTP GET requests: one to obtain the external IP address, and another to a constructed webhook URL embedding system info. This process occurs during package installation, potentially without user awareness. Such automatic data transmission could be used for tracking or malicious data collection. The code does not perform any malicious activity like damaging files or executing harmful commands but exhibits suspicious behavior by sending system info externally during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes a post-installation step that transmits system information to a remote URL, which could be used for tracking or malicious purposes. While no explicit malicious code such as backdoors or destructive actions is present, the automatic data exfiltration during install is a security concern and constitutes suspicious behavior.",
