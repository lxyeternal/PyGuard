{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package with post-installation behavior that executes a custom command.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via platform.node() and platform.system(), and makes HTTP requests to external URLs (https://api.ipify.org and a webhook URL).",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected system data to a remote webhook URL via an HTTP GET request, which can lead to data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The function send() collects system info and the external IP, then constructs a URL with this data and sends an HTTP GET request to the webhook, potentially leaking sensitive environment information.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes the automatic sending of system and network info to an external server during package installation, which is not typical for standard setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a send() function that outputs a message upon completion. It collects system hostname and OS type, and retrieves the external IP address via requests. The send() function constructs a URL embedding this data and sends a GET request to a specified webhook URL. The custom install class executes send() after the standard installation process. This behavior suggests data exfiltration during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. No hardcoded credentials are present, but the automatic reporting of environment data to an external URL during setup is highly suspicious. The purpose appears to be covert data collection, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a hidden data exfiltration mechanism that sends system info to an external webhook during package installation. This behavior is malicious, as it can leak user environment details without consent. The overall security risk is high due to this covert operation, and it should be considered unsafe to use.",
