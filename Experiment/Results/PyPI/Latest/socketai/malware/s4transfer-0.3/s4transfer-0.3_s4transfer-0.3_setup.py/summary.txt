  "conclusion": "The package contains covert data exfiltration behavior during installation, which is highly suspicious and can be considered malicious in terms of privacy invasion. While it does not execute malicious payloads or destructive commands, the activity warrants a high malware and security risk score. The behavior should be flagged as malicious or at least highly suspicious, and use should be discouraged unless explicit user consent is obtained."
