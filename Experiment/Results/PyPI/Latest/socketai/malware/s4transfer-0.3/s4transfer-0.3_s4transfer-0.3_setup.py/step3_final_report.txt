{
  "purpose": "The code performs a post-installation action that collects system hostname, OS, and external IP address, then sends this data to an external webhook URL without user consent.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), platform.system(), requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')",
  "sinks": "requests.get(url) where url contains embedded system info and external IP",
  "flows": "Data collected from platform and requests.get() used to send info to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Automatic data exfiltration during package installation without user notification or consent; no obfuscation; straightforward code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that executes a send() function after installation. The send() function gathers system hostname, OS, and external IP, then constructs a URL embedding this info and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external webhook. This behavior is covert and privacy-invasive, resembling data exfiltration or tracking. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads, but the activity is suspicious and potentially malicious due to unauthorized data collection during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains covert data exfiltration behavior during installation, which is highly suspicious and can be considered malicious in terms of privacy invasion. While it does not execute malicious payloads or destructive commands, the activity warrants a high malware and security risk score. The behavior should be flagged as malicious or at least highly suspicious, and use should be discouraged unless explicit user consent is obtained.",
