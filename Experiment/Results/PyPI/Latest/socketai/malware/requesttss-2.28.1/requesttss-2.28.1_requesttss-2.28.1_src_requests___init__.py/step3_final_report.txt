  "purpose": "Dependency validation, environment setup, and compatibility checks for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Version assertions, import statements, environment checks, SSL fallback mechanisms, warnings, and dependency imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network activity or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Dependency imports and version checks flow into environment validation and fallback mechanisms; no malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Standard dependency assertions and environment fallback code; no suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment validation through version assertions, warnings, and fallback mechanisms for SSL support. It imports dependencies like urllib3, cryptography, chardet, and charset_normalizer, and manages warnings appropriately. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The assertions and warnings are standard for dependency validation and environment setup, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. Slightly elevated risk scores (0.1) in some reports reflect dependency management complexity but are justified and do not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate dependency and environment validation script for the 'requests' library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
