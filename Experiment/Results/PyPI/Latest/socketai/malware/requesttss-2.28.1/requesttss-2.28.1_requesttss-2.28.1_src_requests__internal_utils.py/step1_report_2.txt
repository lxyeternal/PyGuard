  "purpose": "Utility functions for internal use within the Requests library, primarily for header validation and string encoding handling.",
  "sources": "import statements, regex pattern compilations, function parameters, and string inputs within functions.",
  "sinks": "decoding strings, encoding verification, and regex validation functions that operate on header names/values and input strings.",
  "flows": "Input strings are decoded or checked for ASCII compliance; regex patterns validate header names and values. No external data or untrusted sources are explicitly involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of regex for header validation is standard. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides header validation utilities and string handling functions that are typical for a network-related library. It compiles regex patterns to validate headers, and defines functions to convert and check strings for ASCII content. The regex patterns and functions are standard, and there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. No code injections, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are apparent. The functions operate on input data with standard validation logic, with no external network interactions or suspicious file operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for request header validation and string encoding, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate purposes within the Requests library.",
