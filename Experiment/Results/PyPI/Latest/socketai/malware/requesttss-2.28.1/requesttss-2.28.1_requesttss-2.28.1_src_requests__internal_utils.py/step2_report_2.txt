  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines regex patterns for header validation.\n- Provides `to_native_string` to convert input to a native string, decoding bytes if necessary.\n- Provides `unicode_is_ascii` to check if a Unicode string contains only ASCII characters.\n- All functions are standard, straightforward, and involve no network, file, or external data operations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- Regex patterns are standard for header validation.\n- String conversions are typical and safe.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears benign, standard utility functions for internal use in the Requests library.\n\n---\n\n### Review of reports:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns, no malicious behavior, standard regex and string handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minor, justified as the code handles untrusted input but is safe.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard utility code, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — justified.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; straightforward utility functions, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.0 — justified.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard regex and string functions, no malicious logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — justified.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — justified.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) due to handling untrusted input, which is acceptable for such utility code.\n\n### Overall recommendation:\n- The code is safe, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor, due to handling untrusted data, but justified.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard utility module with no security concerns.",
