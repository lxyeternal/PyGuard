{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for header validation and string conversion within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, such as 'string' in 'to_native_string' and 'u_string' in 'unicode_is_ascii'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; functions process data internally without external effects.",
  "flows": "Input data (bytes or str) flows through 'to_native_string' decoding process; 'unicode_is_ascii' checks string content. No external or network flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; regex patterns are standard; string handling is straightforward; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for header validation and two utility functions. 'to_native_string' decodes bytes to str using specified encoding, and 'unicode_is_ascii' verifies ASCII content. No malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The regex patterns are standard for header validation. Functions perform safe, typical string operations. No external data handling or network activity. The code is clear, readable, and serves internal utility purposes. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for header validation and string handling with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports accurately assess its safety, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
