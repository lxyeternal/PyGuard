{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions for handling header validation and string conversions in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, input parameters ('string', 'u_string'), and class/type checks.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output through return statements and performs string decoding and encoding operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('string', 'u_string') are checked or processed, possibly decoded or encoded, and then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. Regular expression patterns and string handling functions are used in standard ways.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines regex patterns for header validation, a function 'to_native_string' that converts input to a native string with optional decoding, and a function 'unicode_is_ascii' that checks for ASCII-only Unicode strings. All functions perform standard string operations, type assertions, and regex validations. No data is sent over network, stored insecurely, or handled in a way that suggests malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for header validation and string manipulation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended solely for internal processing within the Requests library.",
