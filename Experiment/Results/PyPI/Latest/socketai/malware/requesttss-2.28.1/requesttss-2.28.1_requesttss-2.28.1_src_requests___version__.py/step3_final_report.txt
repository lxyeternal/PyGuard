  "purpose": "Static package metadata declarations including version, author, description, URL, and decorative elements.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments for package information and decorative comments/emojis.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignments without external or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative ASCII art and emojis, which are purely aesthetic and do not influence code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata, with no functions, data processing, network activity, or executable logic. The ASCII art and emojis are decorative, not functional. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's benign nature is consistent across multiple assessments, with scores appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code does not read external inputs or contain any suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static metadata declaration with decorative elements, posing no security risks or malicious intent. All assessments and scores are consistent with its harmless nature.",
