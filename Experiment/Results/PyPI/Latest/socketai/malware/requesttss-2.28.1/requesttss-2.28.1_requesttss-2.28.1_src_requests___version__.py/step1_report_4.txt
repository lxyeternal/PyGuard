  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python HTTP library.",
  "sources": "Constants defining metadata such as __title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; the code only assigns static string and integer values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of static metadata assignments and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only metadata assignments for the 'requests' library, including version, author, license, and description. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are used. No functions, network activity, or data processing occur. The ASCII art at the top is purely decorative and not executable logic. The absence of code execution, data handling, or external interactions indicates a benign purpose. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward metadata declaration for a Python package, containing no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe and serves only to provide package information.",
