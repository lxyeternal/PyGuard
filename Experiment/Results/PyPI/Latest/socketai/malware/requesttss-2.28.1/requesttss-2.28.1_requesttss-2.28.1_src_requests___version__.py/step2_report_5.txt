  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely static metadata declarations for the 'requests' package.\n- No external inputs, data processing, network activity, or code execution are present.\n- The use of ASCII art and emojis is decorative, not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are identified.\n\n**Confirming issues:**\n- The code matches the description: static variable assignments with no suspicious or malicious content.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the logic or reasoning of the reports.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign maximum confidence (1) and zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are reasonable.\n\n**Justification of risk scores:**\n- Since the code contains only static metadata with no external inputs, no data flows, and no suspicious patterns, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as there is no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, given the benign nature.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are made; all reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The decorative ASCII art and emojis do not impact security.\n\n**Consistency check:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is purely static metadata with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are needed.",
