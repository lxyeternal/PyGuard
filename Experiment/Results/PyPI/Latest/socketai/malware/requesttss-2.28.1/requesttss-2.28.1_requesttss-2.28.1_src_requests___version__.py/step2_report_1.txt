  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is solely static metadata assignments for the 'requests' package. There are no external inputs, no data flows, no network activity, or executable logic. The ASCII art and emojis are decorative and do not influence behavior. No issues or malicious activity are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly state that the code is benign, static, and metadata-only. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   \n   These are appropriate given the code's nature. No changes are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, and the code is purely static metadata, there is no justification for higher scores. The same applies to `malware` and `obfuscated` scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports assign `malware` = 0, which is correct. The code contains no malicious behavior or indicators of malware.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static nature of the code. They correctly identify that no suspicious or malicious activity is present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is purely metadata with no dynamic or executable content. The decorative elements do not introduce any security concerns. Therefore, all scores are appropriately set to zero.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThis is a benign, static package metadata declaration with no security issues. No further action or concern is warranted.",
