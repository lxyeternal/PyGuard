{
  "purpose": "Define exception classes for the Requests library to handle various error scenarios during HTTP operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions and imports; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up exception classes and their inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward class definitions with inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of exception classes used within the Requests library, including custom errors like RequestException, HTTPError, ConnectionError, and others. It imports exception classes from urllib3 and compat modules. The __init__ methods and __reduce__ method are standard, with no evidence of malicious logic. No dynamic execution, external inputs, or side effects are present. The code is purely structural and error handling related.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical exception class hierarchy for a HTTP client library, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and intended for error handling purposes only.",
