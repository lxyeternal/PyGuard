  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for handling various errors and warnings related to HTTP requests in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "None (this is a definitions module for exceptions, not input data handling).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data processing, no sinks for data leaks or injections).",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as this code only defines exception classes without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code contains standard exception class definitions and inheritance. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides exception class definitions for the Requests library, including custom error types for HTTP errors, connection issues, timeouts, URL errors, and warnings. The class structures follow standard Python inheritance patterns. The import statements are for standard exceptions and compatible JSON error classes. No input handling, data processing, or network operations are present that could be exploited. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious code or behaviors. No signs of malware, backdoors, or data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard exception module for a HTTP request library, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious flows, and no obfuscated or harmful code. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
