  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Requests library to handle various error scenarios during HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exceptions from urllib3 and internal compatibility modules; class definitions that utilize these imports and define exception hierarchies.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiation occurs within class constructors, but no untrusted input handling or data processing that could lead to vulnerabilities is present.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised in various error scenarios within the requests library but no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up exception hierarchies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code strictly defines exception classes with clear, standard inheritance. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions and defines a series of custom exception classes for handling request errors. The constructors initialize exceptions with optional response and request objects, following standard patterns. There is no handling of untrusted input or network data within this code, nor does it execute any dynamic code or make network connections. All classes serve as structured error types for use elsewhere. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes for a HTTP request library. It contains no malicious code, suspicious patterns, or security risks. The code is well-structured for its purpose and does not pose any security threat.",
