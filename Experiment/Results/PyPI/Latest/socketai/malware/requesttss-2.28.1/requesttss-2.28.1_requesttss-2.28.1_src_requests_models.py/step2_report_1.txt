  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code's content, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard, handles encoding, request/response lifecycle, no malicious activity, high confidence (0.95), malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard request/response handling. No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malware. The low security risk score (0.1) is reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n- **Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard implementation, no malicious activity, high confidence (0.95), malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's structure. The slightly higher risk score (0.2) is acceptable but still low. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard request/response handling, no malware, high confidence (0.95), obfuscated=0, malware=0, risk=0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The detailed analysis confirms no malicious patterns. The data flows and sources/sinks are typical. No suspicious activity.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard implementation, no malware, high confidence (0.9), obfuscated=0, malware=0, risk=0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard, secure, no malware, confidence 0.9, malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis matches the code's purpose. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, consistent with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation but generally low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the code's purpose as a request/response handling library with minimal security concerns.\n\n- **Potential for higher scores?** No. The code is a standard HTTP client implementation, with no signs of security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical, well-structured HTTP request/response library component.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious data flows.\n- The data flows and sinks are typical for such libraries and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n### **Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, understandable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, standard request handling)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that. No adjustments needed.",
