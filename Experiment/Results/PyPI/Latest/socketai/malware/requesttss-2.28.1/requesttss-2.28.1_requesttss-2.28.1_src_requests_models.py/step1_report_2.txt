{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for constructing, preparing, sending, and handling HTTP requests and responses in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "User inputs for URL, headers, data, files, JSON payload, cookies, and hooks; internal method calls such as parsing URLs, encoding parameters, and preparing headers and body.",
  "sinks": "Sending HTTP requests; encoding and decoding data; reading from file-like objects; setting headers including cookies and content length; potential network transmission of data.",
  "flows": "Input data (URL, headers, data, files, JSON, cookies) -> preparation methods (prepare_url, prepare_headers, prepare_body, prepare_cookies, prepare_auth, prepare_hooks) -> request body/body encoding -> transmission over network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code contains standard HTTP request/response handling logic. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors. All data encoding, decoding, and request preparation are standard and appropriate for an HTTP client library.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a typical implementation for an HTTP request/response handling library, including URL parsing, header management, body encoding, cookie handling, and response decoding. No unusual or malicious code patterns, such as network exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors, are present. The URL encoding and request preparation functions are standard. All data handling appears safe and in line with expected functionality. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious data flows. The code’s structure and functions are consistent with secure, normal operation of an HTTP client.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of an HTTP request and response handler, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity. The code functions as expected for a network communication library and is free from malware indicators.",
