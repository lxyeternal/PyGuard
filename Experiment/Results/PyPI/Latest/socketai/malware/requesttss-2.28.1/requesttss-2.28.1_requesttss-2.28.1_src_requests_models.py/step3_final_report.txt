{
  "purpose": "The code implements a comprehensive HTTP request and response handling library, managing request construction, encoding, headers, cookies, and response parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data from user parameters, request data, headers, cookies, URL, and files.",
  "sinks": "Request body content, headers, cookies, URL, and response content, which could potentially leak data if malicious data were present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs and parameters into request objects, through encoding and header processing, into the request body, and then from the server response back into response objects and content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected. The code uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an HTTP client component, handling encoding, headers, cookies, request preparation, and response parsing securely. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The data flows are typical for such libraries, with proper error handling and encoding practices. The absence of hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation indicates a high level of security and integrity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of an HTTP request/response handling library, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
