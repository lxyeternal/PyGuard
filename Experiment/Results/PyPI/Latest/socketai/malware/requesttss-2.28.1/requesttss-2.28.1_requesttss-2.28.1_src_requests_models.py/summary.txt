  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of an HTTP request/response handling library, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's purpose and structure."
