{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for cookie management, including extraction, creation, merging, and header handling within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Request headers, response headers, cookie objects, request URL, environment variables (indirectly via standard libraries).",
  "sinks": "Cookie header generation, cookie jar modification, cookie deletion, cookie extraction into jar.",
  "flows": "Request headers are read to produce cookie headers; response headers are parsed to extract cookies; cookies are created or modified in the jar; cookie headers are generated for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie management utilities using Python's http.cookiejar and related modules. It handles cookie extraction, creation, merging, and conversion with typical patterns. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and rely on standard libraries. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The security implications are minimal; the code's permissiveness is typical for cookie utilities and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library. It poses no malware threat, obfuscation, or significant security risk.",
