  "sources": "Reading request headers, response headers, and cookie data from cookie jars.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifying or accessing cookie data, producing cookie headers for requests, and extracting cookies from responses.",
  "flows": "Request headers and response headers flow into cookie parsing functions; cookie data is stored and retrieved via cookie jar methods; cookies are converted between different formats and stored in jars.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Use of thread locking is standard. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names. No network activity or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides cookie handling functionalities including creating, copying, merging, and extracting cookies. It wraps standard cookiejar functionalities with additional methods for dictionary-like access and cookie management. All operations are limited to cookie data manipulation, with no network calls, file system access, or system command execution. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected; functions follow expected behaviors for cookie management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured cookie management utility functions for requests, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It handles cookies securely within the scope of its functionality, without network or system impact.",
