  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard cookie management functions, extracting from request/response, managing cookie jars.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries and patterns.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate utility code, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent, no issues.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar cookie utilities, including extracting, creating, and managing cookies.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. Standard practices.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.95), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.  \n- **Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Cookie management functions, converting, extracting, and setting cookies.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, perfect confidence (1.0), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Clear and safe.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Standard cookie handling, merging, copying, extracting.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, standard library usage.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (1.0), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1 (slightly above zero but acceptable).  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent detected.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Utility functions for cookie handling, no network or system commands.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2 (still low).  \n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The highest malware score across reports is 0, with some reports at 0.0 and a few at 0.1 or 0.2, which are still very low and likely reflect minor security risk considerations rather than actual malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All reports are about cookie management utilities, which are inherently low risk. Slightly above zero in some cases (e.g., 0.1 or 0.2) likely due to minor security considerations but nothing alarming.\n\n- **Code Presence:** The code is standard, well-structured, and does not contain any hidden or malicious patterns.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** (very low, typical for utility code, no significant security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of cookie handling utilities for the requests library. It poses no malware threat, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure to monitor for future updates or modifications, but based on the current review, no issues are present.",
