  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for any anomalies, and assess the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n**Summary:** The code is a standard utility module for cookie management, with no malicious indicators. It handles cookie extraction, header generation, and cookie jar management using standard libraries.  \n**Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.9 (but assigned as 0).  \n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.  \n- The high security risk score (0.9) seems unreasonable; the report assigns 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- The overall conclusion is appropriate.  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code provides cookie utilities with standard patterns, no malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n**Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.95 (but assigned as 0).  \n**Assessment:**  \n- The analysis confirms no malicious intent.  \n- The high security risk score (0.95) is unjustified; assigned as 0, which is correct.  \n- The code's functions are typical for cookie handling, with no suspicious behavior.  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n**Summary:** Standard cookie management utilities, no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n**Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 1.0 (but assigned as 0).  \n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is a typical cookie utility implementation.  \n- The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n- No issues detected.  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n**Summary:** Cookie handling functions, no suspicious activity, no obfuscation, standard patterns.  \n**Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1 (but assigned as 0.0).  \n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is standard, with no malicious or obfuscated code.  \n- The low security risk score is justified and consistent.  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n**Summary:** Utility functions for cookie handling, no malicious or suspicious behavior, standard patterns.  \n**Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2 (assigned as 0).  \n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent.  \n- The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard, benign cookie management utilities.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is justified given the code content.\n- Obfuscation scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscated code.\n- Security risk scores are low (0 or 0.1–0.2), reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the code's content.\n- No further adjustments are necessary.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard utility code)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the provided reports.",
