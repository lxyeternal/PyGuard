  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies in the requests library, including cookie extraction, header generation, and cookie jar management.",
  "sources": "Data is read from HTTP response headers (`response._original_response.msg`), request objects (`request`), environment variables (indirectly via imported modules), and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Cookie headers in requests (`get_cookie_header`), cookie storage and retrieval (`RequestsCookieJar`, `create_cookie`, `morsel_to_cookie`), and cookie jar manipulation functions (`remove_cookie_by_name`, `merge_cookies`).",
  "flows": "Cookies are extracted from HTTP response headers into a cookie jar; cookies are created or modified via `create_cookie` and `set`, then potentially retrieved or deleted; cookies flow from response headers to jar, and from jar to request headers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code. The code performs standard cookie management functions. Usage of try-except blocks for threading imports is typical for compatibility and not suspicious. No obfuscated code or unusual control flow patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for handling cookies in the requests library, including wrapping request and response objects for cookie management, extracting cookies from responses, and setting or deleting cookies in a cookie jar. It uses conventional methods such as copying cookies, converting Morsel objects, and updating cookie jars. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system commands, network communications outside cookie management, or obfuscation are present. The code relies on standard libraries and patterns for cookie handling, with appropriate security precautions like not exposing cookies unnecessarily. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate purposes related to HTTP cookie management without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a set of cookie management utilities intended for use with the requests library. It performs expected functions such as extracting, setting, deleting, and merging cookies without any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a legitimate, security-conscious implementation of cookie handling.",
