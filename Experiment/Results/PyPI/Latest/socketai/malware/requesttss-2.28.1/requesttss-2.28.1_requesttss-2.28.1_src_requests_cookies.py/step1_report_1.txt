  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and utility functions for handling cookies within the requests library, including extracting, managing, and converting cookies between different formats.",
  "sources": "Request object headers and URL, response headers, cookie attributes, environment variables, and external cookie dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Sending cookie headers, setting or removing cookies in the CookieJar, and cookie serialization/deserialization.",
  "flows": "Input data from request headers, URL, or external dictionaries flow into cookie creation and management functions; cookies are extracted from responses and added to CookieJars; cookie headers are generated for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. The code primarily handles cookie parsing and management using standard libraries and patterns. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie handling operations: wrapping request/response objects for cookie management, extracting cookies from responses, generating cookie headers, and managing cookies within a CookieJar with dict-like interfaces. The functions use typical patterns for parsing, creating, and updating cookies, including handling cookie attributes such as 'max-age' and 'expires'. No external or suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code relies on standard Python modules and safe practices, with no signs of malicious modifications or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility module for cookie management within the requests library. It contains no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate cookie handling in a standard, transparent manner.",
