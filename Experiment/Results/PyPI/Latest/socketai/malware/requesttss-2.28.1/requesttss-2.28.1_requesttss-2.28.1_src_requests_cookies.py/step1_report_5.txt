  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for handling cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, header management, and cookie jar manipulation.",
  "sources": "Reads include request headers (e.g., get_header, has_header), cookie parameters, and response headers (response._original_response.msg).",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data is accessed via cookie and header retrieval functions; cookies are manipulated and stored in CookieJar objects. No direct data leaks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Request headers are read (e.g., get_header), cookies are added or retrieved from CookieJar (set, get, copy), and cookies are extracted from responses into CookieJar (extract_cookies_to_jar).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or backdoors. The code is primarily utility functions with standard behavior. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility classes and functions to manage cookies, including wrapping request and response objects, extracting cookies from responses, and cookie jar operations. All functions operate with expected parameters, and no suspicious or malicious activity is observed. The cookie manipulation logic is standard and does not contain hardcoded secrets or covert behaviors. The only potential concern is the permissive cookie setting/removing methods, but these are typical for cookie management libraries. No evidence of malicious code or sabotage present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility and compatibility code for cookie handling within the requests library. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It functions as intended for managing cookies securely and compatibly.",
