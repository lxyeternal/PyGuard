{
  "purpose": "This code provides the default CA certificate bundle location for the requests library, primarily used for HTTPS certificate validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path, which is not a security sink but a display of the certificate location.",
  "flows": "Source: 'where' function from certifi → Sink: print statement output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi', which is a standard package for managing CA certificates. It then prints the location of the CA bundle when executed directly. The code is simple, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated elements, or suspicious behavior. It serves a utility purpose related to HTTPS certificate validation and configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for utility purposes to locate the CA certificate bundle used by requests. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It is safe to use.",
