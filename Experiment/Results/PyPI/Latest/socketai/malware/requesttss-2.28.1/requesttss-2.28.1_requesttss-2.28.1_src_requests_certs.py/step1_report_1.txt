{
  "purpose": "This code provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the requests library, primarily for SSL verification purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The source 'where()' provides a trusted path to the CA bundle; the only output is printed to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated segments, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from certifi, which returns the standard CA bundle path. It only prints this path when executed directly. The code is straightforward and relies on a well-known, trusted library. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or suspicious activities. The code's structure is simple and clear, with no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that outputs the default CA bundle path used by requests. It does not contain malware, security risks, or anomalies. The code appears safe and intended for legitimate use in packaging or environment setup.",
