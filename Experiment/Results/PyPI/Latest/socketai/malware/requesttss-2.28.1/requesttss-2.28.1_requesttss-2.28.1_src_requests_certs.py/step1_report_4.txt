{
  "purpose": "This code retrieves and prints the default CA certificate bundle location provided by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The printed output is the CA bundle path; no untrusted data processing or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Source (certifi.where) -> Output (print)",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors. The code simply calls a function from a trusted library and prints the result.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the certifi package to locate the CA bundle. It then prints this location when run as a script. There are no user inputs, no external data sources, and no data manipulation or network operations. The code is straightforward and intended for informational purposes only. It does not perform any actions that could be malicious, such as data exfiltration, code execution, or network communications beyond displaying a file path.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to output the location of the CA bundle from certifi. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
