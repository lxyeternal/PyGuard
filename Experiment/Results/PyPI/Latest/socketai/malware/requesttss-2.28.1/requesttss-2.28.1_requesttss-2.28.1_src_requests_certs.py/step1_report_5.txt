{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package, mainly used for verifying SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "The import of 'where' from the 'certifi' package and the print statement that outputs the CA bundle location.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs data, but since it prints a known file path, it does not pose a security risk or data leak in this context.",
  "flows": "Input (imported 'where' function) -> output (printed CA bundle location). No untrusted data sources or external input flow into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The code is straightforward and relies on a trusted library.",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports a function from a reputable package and outputs its result. No user input handling, no network activity, and no manipulation of data. The code is minimal and conventional, serving a utility purpose without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to display the default CA bundle path from certifi. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
