  "purpose": "Outputs the file path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the requests library, relying on the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "Printing the path returned by 'where()' when executed directly.",
  "flows": "Import from certifi -> call 'where()' -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted function from a well-known library and prints its output. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. The purpose is solely to display the CA bundle path. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and reliance on a reputable library minimize security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that outputs the trusted CA bundle path. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
