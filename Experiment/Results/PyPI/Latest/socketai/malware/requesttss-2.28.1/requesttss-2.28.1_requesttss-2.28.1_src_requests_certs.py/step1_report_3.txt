{
  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle path using the certifi package, primarily for use in configuring SSL/TLS verification.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the certifi package; execution triggers a call to certifi.where() to obtain the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'print(where())' which exposes the file path of the CA bundle.",
  "flows": "The code calls certifi.where() to obtain the CA bundle path and then prints it to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard library and package functions without obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the certifi package, which is a well-known package for managing CA certificates. When executed as a script, it prints the path to the CA bundle. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks beyond printing a file path, and no code execution or network activity. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs. It functions as a simple utility script intended to inform about the CA bundle location.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves as a utility to output the CA certificate bundle path. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
