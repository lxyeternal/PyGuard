{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions for Python 2 and 3, handling imports and version-specific behaviors.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version checks, and dynamic module resolution functions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; the code mainly handles imports and compatibility.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code does not process external input data or perform data transformations.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs dynamic imports of optional libraries like 'chardet' and 'simplejson', but this is typical for compatibility handling and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages compatibility between Python 2 and 3, imports optional libraries conditionally, and defines some version-specific variables. No code execution based on untrusted input, data leakage, or malicious activities are present. All import patterns and logic follow standard practices for supporting multiple Python versions. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard compatibility and import management code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
