{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling character detection and URL parsing across different Python versions, primarily for backwards compatibility in the requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from import statements, system version info, and attempts to import optional modules like 'simplejson' and character detection libraries.",
  "sinks": "No significant sinks are present; the code does not execute untrusted data or perform any network or file operations.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules and assigning variables based on environment detection; no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes standard compatibility boilerplate; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The dynamic import of optional libraries is typical for compatibility modules.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, conditional imports, and compatibility handling, all of which are common in open-source projects aimed at supporting multiple Python versions. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The import logic for 'chardet' and 'simplejson' is straightforward. No data is processed or transmitted, and there are no suspicious behaviors such as network activity, credential handling, or code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign compatibility utility for the requests library, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is standard, well-structured code used to ensure cross-version support without any suspicious or harmful components.",
