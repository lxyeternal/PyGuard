  "purpose": "Compatibility layer for handling import issues and version detection across Python 2 and 3, including optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, optional third-party libraries ('chardet', 'charset_normalizer', 'simplejson'), version info via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network or file operations involving untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; import logic is static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and version detection logic with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard compatibility handling, with dynamic imports of optional libraries and version checks. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute code from untrusted sources. The import patterns and logic are typical for such utility modules. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe and well-structured module.",
