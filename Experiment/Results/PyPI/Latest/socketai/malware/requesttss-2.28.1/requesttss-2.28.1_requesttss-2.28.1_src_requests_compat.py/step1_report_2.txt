{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling character detection and URL processing across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements and the _resolve_char_detection function, which dynamically imports 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' based on availability.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed directly; no data is sent over networks, stored insecurely, or executed.",
  "flows": "The code initializes character detection library, determines Python version, and imports modules accordingly. No untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The dynamic import of optional libraries appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports character detection libraries ('chardet' or 'charset_normalizer') if available, which is a typical compatibility pattern. It detects Python version to set flags for compatibility. Conditional import of 'simplejson' is used for JSON handling. It imports standard modules for URL and cookie handling. No data is read from untrusted sources; the code mainly sets up environment and dependencies. There are no unsafe operations, no code injection points, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard compatibility and import setup code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely handles environment detection and module imports for compatibility purposes.",
