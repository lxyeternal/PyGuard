{
  "purpose": "This module handles compatibility issues across different Python versions and imports necessary modules for character detection, JSON processing, and URL handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as importlib, sys, simplejson, json, collections, http.cookies, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform any data output, network operations, or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines variables",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code segments are present. The code performs standard compatibility imports and module detection.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various standard and third-party modules conditionally, handles compatibility between Python 2 and 3, and defines some basic type aliases. The _resolve_char_detection function attempts to import 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' for character detection, which is a typical pattern. No untrusted input processing, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears to be standard library compatibility code with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical compatibility and import utility module with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It simply manages imports and version compatibility, and does not process or handle untrusted data.",
