{
  "purpose": "This module handles compatibility issues across different Python versions and manages imports for character detection libraries and various standard modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from import statements, sys.version_info, and function calls to import modules like importlib, simplejson, and standard libraries.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe are the dynamic import attempts via importlib and import statements for third-party libraries like simplejson. However, these are standard practice and not sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code dynamically imports character detection libraries, conditionally imports json or simplejson, and sets compatibility flags. There are no direct flows of untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The code is straightforward and maintains compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on maintaining compatibility across Python versions and importing standard modules. It uses importlib to conditionally import third-party libraries and handles import errors gracefully. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious code patterns. The dynamic import logic is standard for compatibility layers. No obfuscation or malware-like activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical imports and version checks without any suspicious behaviors.",
