{
  "purpose": "Defines internal data structures for the Requests library, specifically case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, dictionary operations such as update, setitem, getitem, and iteration.",
  "sinks": "Internal data storage within the class instances; no external data leaks or system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from initialization into internal OrderedDict or dict, with key normalization in CaseInsensitiveDict.",
  "anomalies": "The copy() method in CaseInsensitiveDict returns self._store.values(), which is incorrect; it should return a proper copy of the internal store. No obfuscation or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict, which manages case-insensitive string keys by storing them in lowercase but preserving original case for iteration, and LookupDict, a simple dict extension with a name attribute. Both classes do not perform external I/O or system calls, and no malicious code or obfuscation is present. The only notable issue is the bug in the copy() method of CaseInsensitiveDict, which returns an iterable view instead of a proper copy, but this is a correctness bug, not a security concern. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing standard internal data structures without malicious or obfuscated content. The only flaw is a minor bug in the copy() method, which does not impact security. All reports correctly assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code is safe for use within the Requests library.",
