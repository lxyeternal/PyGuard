  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing standard internal data structures without malicious or obfuscated content. The only flaw is a minor bug in the copy() method, which does not impact security. All reports correctly assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code is safe for use within the Requests library."
