{
  "purpose": "Provides data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup objects used within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization of data structures (__init__), dictionary access (__getitem__), update methods (via update()), and any method that reads from self._store or self.__dict__.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present. No external data outputs, network communications, or sensitive data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input data provided to constructors or update methods flows into internal storage; dictionary access methods retrieve data from internal structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict, which implements a case-insensitive dict-like object using an internal OrderedDict, and LookupDict, a simple dictionary wrapper with a custom __repr__. Both classes are standard data structures, with methods aligning with their intended use. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code relies solely on standard library components and does not perform any unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup objects for internal use within Requests. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious operations, or security risks.",
