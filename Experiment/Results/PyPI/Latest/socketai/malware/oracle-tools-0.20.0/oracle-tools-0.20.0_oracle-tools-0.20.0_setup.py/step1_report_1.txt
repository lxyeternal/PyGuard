{
  "purpose": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'oracle-tools' and includes a custom installation command that executes during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information using os.getlogin() and os.uname().nodename during the custom install process.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run() executes a shell command that performs an nslookup on an encoded string derived from system info, redirecting output to /dev/null.",
  "flows": "System info is obtained (source) and encoded in base64, then used to construct a malicious nslookup command (sink) executed via subprocess during install.",
  "anomalies": "The use of os.getlogin() and os.uname().nodename for generating a string, encoding it, and then performing an external DNS query to a suspicious domain is unusual and potentially malicious. The DNS query appears to be part of a data exfiltration or beaconing attempt.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration with a custom install command that, when run, gathers system login and hostname info, encodes it in base64, and uses it in a DNS lookup command directed at a suspicious domain. The command's purpose is unclear and seems to perform external network communication with potential data leakage intent. There are no other malicious code or backdoors detected, but the behavior indicates covert data transmission. The use of shell=True in subprocess and redirecting output to /dev/null suggest an attempt to hide activity. The rest of the setup code appears benign, but the custom install behavior is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a covert data exfiltration mechanism via DNS lookup during package installation, indicating malicious behavior. The rest of the setup code is standard. This package exhibits high malicious potential due to its install-time network activity.",
