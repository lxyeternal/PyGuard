{
  "purpose": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation by sending system info encoded in base64 via DNS lookup to a suspicious domain.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.uname().nodename, base64 encoding of combined info",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing shell command with DNS query to external domain",
  "flows": "system info -> base64 encoding -> DNS lookup via subprocess during install",
  "anomalies": "DNS query to suspicious domain with encoded system info, use of shell=True, output redirected to /dev/null",
  "analysis": "The code collects system login and hostname, encodes this info, and performs a DNS lookup to a suspicious domain during installation, hiding activity with output redirection and shell=True. This pattern indicates covert data exfiltration or tracking. The use of system info and external DNS query during setup is highly suspicious and malicious. The code contains no other malicious payloads but the exfiltration activity alone justifies high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits malicious behavior by covertly transmitting system info via DNS during installation, constituting a severe security threat. The activity is consistent with malicious intent, warranting maximum malware and security risk scores.",
