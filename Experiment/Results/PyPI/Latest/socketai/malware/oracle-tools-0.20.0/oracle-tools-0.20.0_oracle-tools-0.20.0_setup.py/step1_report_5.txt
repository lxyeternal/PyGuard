{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up and install a Python package named 'oracle-tools' with custom behavior during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information using os.getlogin() and os.uname().nodename, and also reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run command executes a shell command that performs a DNS lookup on an encoded string, potentially sending data over the network.",
  "flows": "The system info is encoded in base64, then included in a DNS lookup query to a suspicious domain, potentially leaking system information to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.getlogin() and os.uname() for system info collection, combined with a DNS lookup that encodes this info and sends it externally. The DNS query output is suppressed, indicating an attempt to hide activity. The command is executed with shell=True, which can be risky.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during installation, gathers current user login and hostname, encodes this info in base64, and performs a DNS lookup to a potentially malicious domain with the encoded info. This behavior resembles data exfiltration via DNS, a common tactic in malicious activities. The use of shell=True in subprocess.run increases risk, and the DNS query output is suppressed to avoid detection. The rest of the setup code appears normal, with no other suspicious activities. The package's description and author info do not indicate malicious intent but do not exclude malicious behavior either.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious activity: exfiltration of system info via DNS lookup during installation. This suggests possible malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior related to data leakage. The activity is concealed and potentially harmful, warranting caution.",
