  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to perform a network lookup involving system and hostname information.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.uname().nodename",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing a network command",
  "flows": "os.getlogin() and os.uname().nodename -> base64 encoding -> command string -> subprocess.run()",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 encoding of system information for obfuscation; executes a network command during installation; command is sent to a suspicious domain.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that gathers system login and hostname data, encodes it in base64, and constructs a shell command to perform an nslookup query to a potentially malicious or tracking domain. This occurs during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The command outputs to /dev/null, but the act of querying a remote domain with encoded system info suggests tracking or reconnaissance activity. No other malicious payloads or backdoors are evident. The code’s intent appears to collect system info and send it remotely without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior related to collecting system information and making external network requests during package installation. This pattern resembles tracking or reconnaissance activities rather than benign package behavior. It poses a security risk and should be flagged for review or removal.",
