{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package named 'oracle-tools' with a custom installation step that executes a network command.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information using os.getlogin() and os.uname().nodename, and the setup configuration reads from a README.md file.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run() executes a shell command that performs a DNS lookup, sending data to an external server (oast.live).",
  "flows": "The system info is encoded with base64 and embedded into a DNS query, which is then sent to an external server via subprocess shell execution.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class constructs and executes a DNS lookup command that encodes and transmits system information to an external domain, which is suspicious and potentially malicious behavior. The command runs unconditionally during package installation, indicating possible covert data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon execution, gathers the current user's login and system hostname, encodes this data with base64, and sends it to an external domain via a DNS lookup. This behavior is embedded within the setup script, which is typically used for package installation, meaning this data transmission occurs when the package is installed. The use of subprocess with shell=True for executing a network command that encodes and transmits system info is a strong indicator of malicious or privacy-invading intent, especially as it is hidden within a standard setup routine. There is no legitimate reason for a package to perform such network operations during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior that transmits system information to an external server during installation. This is highly suspicious and indicates possible data exfiltration or malicious tracking. The code should be considered malicious due to covert data transmission during package setup.",
