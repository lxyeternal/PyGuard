{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up and install a Python package named 'oracle-tools' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information using os.getlogin() and os.uname().nodename.",
  "sinks": "It executes a subprocess command that performs an nslookup on an encoded string, redirecting output to /dev/null.",
  "flows": "System info (user and hostname) is encoded in base64 and then used in a shell command that performs an external network lookup.",
  "anomalies": "The use of base64 encoding of system information combined with a network request to an external domain suggests potential data exfiltration or tracking. The command's purpose is obscure, and it contacts a suspicious domain (oast.live).",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during package installation, gathers the current user's login name and system hostname, encodes this info in base64, and performs a DNS lookup to an external domain, redirecting output to /dev/null. This behavior is unusual for a standard setup script and may be intended for tracking, data exfiltration, or backdoor purposes. No other malicious code or hardcoded secrets are present. The external network request and use of system info in this context raise security concerns. The overall code structure is typical, but the network activity during installation is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits potentially malicious behavior by transmitting system information to an external domain during installation, indicating possible data exfiltration or tracking activity. No clear benign purpose justifies this network request in a standard package setup.",
