  "purpose": "Retrieve the current user's login name and hostname as a string.",

  "sinks": "None; data is returned but not transmitted or stored externally",
  "flows": "Data flows from system calls into a string, then returned",
  "anomalies": "Unused imports (subprocess, base64) present but benign",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules but only uses os functions to get login and hostname info, concatenates into a string, and returns it. No data is transmitted externally, no malicious code, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior detected. The unused imports suggest incomplete or leftover code but do not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, performing simple system info retrieval with no malicious intent or security risks. The unused imports are harmless but could be cleaned up. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
