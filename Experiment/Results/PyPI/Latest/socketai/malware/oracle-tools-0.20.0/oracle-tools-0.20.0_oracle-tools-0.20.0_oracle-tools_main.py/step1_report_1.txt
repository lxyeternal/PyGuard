{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the current user's login name and hostname, and return this information as a formatted string.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.uname().nodename",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data is written to external systems or files",
  "flows": "Data flows from system calls (getlogin, uname) into a string, with no further transmission or processing",
  "anomalies": "Import of 'subprocess' and 'base64' modules without their usage; no encoding or subprocess calls are made, which is unusual and might suggest leftover code or incomplete implementation",
  "analysis": "The code gathers user login and hostname information via standard system calls and returns the formatted string. The import statements for 'subprocess' and 'base64' are unused, which could indicate leftover code or preparatory code for future features. No data is transmitted, stored insecurely, or manipulated maliciously. The code does not perform any dangerous operations, nor does it contain obfuscated code or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply retrieves system information and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The unused imports may suggest incomplete or placeholder code but do not pose a security concern.",
