  "purpose": "Retrieve and return the current user's login name and hostname as a combined string.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.uname().nodename",
  "sinks": "None evident; the data is returned but not used elsewhere in this snippet.",
  "flows": "os.getlogin() and os.uname().nodename are called, combined into a string, and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Unused imports (subprocess, base64) suggest possible leftover code or incomplete implementation; no actual data exfiltration or malicious activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules that are not used (subprocess, base64), indicating potential unused code or preparation for other functionalities. The main function retrieves the current user's login and the system's hostname, combines them into a string, and returns it. There are no inputs from external sources, no data transmission, and no suspicious or malicious behavior. The code performs a simple retrieval of system information and prints nothing, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, benign, and appears intended for informational purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. The unused imports could be cleaned up, but they do not indicate malicious intent.",
