{
  "purpose": "Generate and return a string containing the current user's login name and hostname.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.uname().nodename",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but the data could potentially be exposed or logged if used improperly.",
  "flows": "get_encoded_user_host() retrieves user login and hostname, which could be used or transmitted if integrated with other systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.getlogin() and os.uname() could be used to gather system info, but no malicious activity or data exfiltration is evident in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code simply collects the current user's login name and system hostname and returns this as a formatted string. It imports modules subprocess, base64, and os, but only uses os. getlogin() and uname(). The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The use of os.getlogin() and os.uname() is standard for gathering system info, but if used in a larger context, this data could be sensitive. However, in this isolated snippet, there is no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and primarily gathers system information without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions, data leaks, or malicious communications.",
