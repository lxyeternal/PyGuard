{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'main_function' from a local module called 'core', likely to execute main program logic.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which loads 'main_function' from the local 'core' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this snippet; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable; the code only performs an import statement without execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, which indicates dependency on a local module. Since it does not execute or manipulate data, there are no security concerns or malicious indicators. The absence of additional code prevents any further assessment of behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing a simple import with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger codebase that uses 'core.main_function'.",
