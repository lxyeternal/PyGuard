{
  "purpose": "The code imports the main_function from a local module named core, likely to execute the main functionality of the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .core import main_function indicates the source is the local core module within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this snippet; it does not handle any data or untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing main_function from the local core module, which would be used elsewhere in the code; no direct source-to-sink flow is observable here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code fragment only contains an import statement from a local module, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not process data, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious logic. Given its simplicity and standard structure, there are no security concerns or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and normal for a Python project structure.",
