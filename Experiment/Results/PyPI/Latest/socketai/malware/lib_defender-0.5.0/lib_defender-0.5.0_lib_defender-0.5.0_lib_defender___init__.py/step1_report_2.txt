{
  "purpose": "Imports the main_function from the core module, likely part of a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .core import main_function",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this snippet; no data or untrusted input is handled or transmitted",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output processes observed in this minimal code snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, only a relative import; no unusual or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a relative import from the core module, which is typical in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior. No inputs, outputs, or data flows are present to analyze further. The simplicity suggests standard package structure without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, representing a typical import statement within a package. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected based on this fragment.",
