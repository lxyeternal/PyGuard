  "purpose": "The code imports the main_function from a local core module, likely for executing primary application logic.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module (.core), which does not read external input or data directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data are present in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow identifiable from this code snippet alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with only a relative import; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The snippet consists of a single import statement that imports main_function from a local module named core. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks shown. Without additional context or code execution, there are no signs of malicious behavior. The structure appears standard for a Python project. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, representing a standard import statement with no malicious or security concerns evident in this isolated snippet.",
