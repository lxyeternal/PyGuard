  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple import statement: `from .core import main_function`.\n- They consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are all 0, indicating no malicious behavior detected or suspected.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code snippet. The code is a standard import statement.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- **Scores review:**\n  - The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent.\n  - The security risk scores are all 0, appropriate for such a minimal import statement.\n  - The confidence scores are high, reflecting the clarity of the code.\n\n### Potential points of critique:\n- The reports do not consider the context in which this import might be used. While the import itself is benign, if the `main_function` in `core` were malicious or maliciously modified, that would change the risk profile. However, based solely on this code snippet, no such concern can be inferred.\n- The reports assume that the import is from a local module within a package, which is reasonable, but they do not mention the possibility of malicious modifications in the local module itself. Without inspecting the `core` module, we cannot definitively rule out malicious code there.\n\n### Justification for risk and malware scores:\n- Since all reports correctly identify the code as benign, and no suspicious behavior is observed or implied, the scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n- The high confidence scores are appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk based on this snippet)\n\n**Note:** If additional context or code from `core` is provided later, the assessment might need revision.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet. The scores are appropriate, and there are no signs of malicious activity or security concerns in this minimal import statement.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as-is: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
