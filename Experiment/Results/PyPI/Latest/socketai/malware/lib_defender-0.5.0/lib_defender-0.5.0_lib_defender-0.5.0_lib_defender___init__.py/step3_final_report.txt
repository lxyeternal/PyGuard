  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of 'main_function' from a local module named 'core', typically used within a package to organize code.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module 'core' within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this snippet; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "The source (import statement) loads 'main_function' from 'core'; no data flows or execution paths are present beyond this import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import, common in Python packages. It does not execute any code or handle data directly. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this snippet, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as 0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the minimal and standard import statement. No further analysis or modifications are necessary given the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports accurately assess the snippet as safe, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
