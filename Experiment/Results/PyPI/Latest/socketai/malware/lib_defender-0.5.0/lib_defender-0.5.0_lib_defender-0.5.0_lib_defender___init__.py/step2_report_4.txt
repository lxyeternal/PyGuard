  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully, focusing on the core code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .core import main_function\n```\n\n**Assessment of the code:**\n- It is a straightforward relative import from a local module named `core`.\n- There are no data flows, no input/output handling, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The code is minimal and typical for Python packages.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code snippet itself does not contain any issues. It performs a simple import, which is standard practice.\n\n### 2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent in their analysis, correctly identifying the minimal, benign nature of the code.\n- They do not overstate or assume malicious intent where none exists.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### 3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The \"malware\" score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are also 0, which is consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n### 4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct given the benign nature of the code.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions, so high risk scores would be unjustified.\n\n### 5. **Malware score considerations:**\n- Since the code only imports a function from a local module, there is no indication of malicious behavior.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### 6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent.\n- They correctly interpret the code as part of a larger package, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n### 7. **Score consistency:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; all indicate benign behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks evident.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately conservative. The code snippet is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If additional context or code were provided (e.g., what `main_function` does, how it's used), a more comprehensive assessment could be made. But based solely on this import statement, the risk remains negligible.",
