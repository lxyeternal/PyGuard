{
  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python dependency code for malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, and security risks, focusing on source-to-sink data flows, anomalies, and code structure.",
  "sources": "Input reading points such as environment variables, user inputs, file reads, network requests, or data parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points like network transmissions, file writes, system commands, or database queries where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Paths from sources to sinks where untrusted data propagates, potentially leading to security issues or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), suspicious imports, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, and no malicious functions. No data leaks or insecure practices are evident. No sources or sinks are identified that could lead to malicious activity. The code structure is simple and benign, with no anomalies detected. The overall confidence in benignity is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard utility or data processing code without suspicious patterns or anomalies. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and security risk is 0.2, reflecting minimal concern.",
