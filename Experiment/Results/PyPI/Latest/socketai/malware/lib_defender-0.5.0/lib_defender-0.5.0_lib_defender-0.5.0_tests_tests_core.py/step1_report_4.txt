  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script performing some basic operations, likely for data processing or utility purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, environment variables, or standard input.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, files, or network connections; potentially insecure writes or transmissions.",
  "flows": "Data from input sources flows through functions and may reach output sinks, potentially over network if network functions are used.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns observed; no obfuscated code or hidden modules detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward, utilizing common Python libraries without suspicious imports. It processes data inputs and produces outputs. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized network connections. Absence of hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated segments. No external malicious dependencies or unusual control flows detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign based on the provided fragment. No indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility script with no malicious behavior or supply chain risks.",
