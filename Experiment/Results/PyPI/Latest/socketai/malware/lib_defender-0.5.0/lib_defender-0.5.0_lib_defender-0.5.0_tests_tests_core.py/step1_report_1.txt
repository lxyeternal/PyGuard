  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through functions or operations (not explicitly visible).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observable in the provided snippet. Lack of code makes detailed anomaly detection impossible.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of actual code, detailed source, sink, or flow analysis cannot be performed. Without code content, it is not possible to identify malicious behaviors or security risks.",
