  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include environment variables, input functions, or external file reads (not explicitly shown in the code snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, or command executions if present, but none are explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "Data flow pathways cannot be conclusively identified without more context, but typical flows would involve reading input and processing it locally.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are observed in the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain suspicious or malicious constructs. It uses standard Python syntax and libraries. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The absence of network activity, credential handling, or system modification suggests low risk. Due to limited code context, some assumptions are made, but nothing indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no indicators of malware or suspicious activities.",
