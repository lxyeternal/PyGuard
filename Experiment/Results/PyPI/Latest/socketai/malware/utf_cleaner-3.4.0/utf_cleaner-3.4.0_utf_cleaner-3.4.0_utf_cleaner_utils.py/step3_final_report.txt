  "purpose": "Utility function to check if a character can be encoded in UTF-8, serving as a validation step.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'char' provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "The 'encode' method on 'char' which attempts to encode the character in UTF-8.",
  "flows": "Input 'char' is encoded; if successful, returns True; if UnicodeEncodeError occurs, returns False.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward try-except logic.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to encode a single character in UTF-8, catching UnicodeEncodeError exceptions. It is a simple, standard validation utility with no network calls, data leaks, or malicious actions. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with consistent scoring of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The function's purpose and implementation are clear and appropriate, with high confidence in its safety. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward UTF-8 validation function with no malicious behavior or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
