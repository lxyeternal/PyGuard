  "purpose": "Validator for UTF-8 strings to ensure input is of type str.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text' in validate_input method.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is checked for type; if not string, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed; the code performs a simple type check.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a custom exception, defines a class with a static method to validate that input is a string, and raises an error if validation fails. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activities. The logic is straightforward and standard for input validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic input type validation without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a harmless utility class.",
