  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward class `UTFValidator` with a static method `validate_input` that checks if the input `text` is a string.\n   - If not, it raises an `InvalidInputError`.\n   - The import from `.exceptions` is standard, and the logic is minimal and typical for input validation.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently describe the code as a simple, standard input validation utility.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious activities are detected.\n   - The reports' conclusions align with the code's nature: harmless, straightforward, with no security risks.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Inconsistencies:**\n   - The only point to consider is the `malware` score. Since the code is purely for validation and raises a custom exception, there is no indication of malicious intent.\n   - The `securityRisk` is correctly scored as 0, as the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is safe.\n   - The code does not perform any complex operations, external calls, or data manipulations that could hide malicious intent.\n   - The exception `InvalidInputError` is assumed to be a standard custom exception; nothing suspicious is implied.\n\n6. **Final Justification:**\n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n   - The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - The risk score should be 0, reflecting no security issues.\n   - The obfuscated score is correct at 0.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a simple, benign input validation utility.\n- All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores are reasonable and should remain as they are.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and no security risks involved.",
