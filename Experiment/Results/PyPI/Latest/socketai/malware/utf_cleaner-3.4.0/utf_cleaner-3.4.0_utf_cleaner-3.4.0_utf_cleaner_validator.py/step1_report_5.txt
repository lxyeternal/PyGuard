  "purpose": "Validator for UTF-8 strings to ensure input is a string type.",
  "sources": "The method validate_input reads the 'text' input parameter.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data effects are explicitly present; no data leakage or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is checked for type; if not a string, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no unusual dynamic behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a validator class with a static method to verify if input is a string. If the input is not a string, it raises an InvalidInputError. There are no external data flows, no network operations, or file system interactions. The code appears to serve a validation purpose without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malware indicators.",
