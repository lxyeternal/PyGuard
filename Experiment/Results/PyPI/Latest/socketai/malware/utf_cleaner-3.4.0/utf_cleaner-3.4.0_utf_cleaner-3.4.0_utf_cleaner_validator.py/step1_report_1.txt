  "purpose": "Validator for UTF-8 strings to ensure input is of string type.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in validate_input method.",
  "sinks": "Potential exception raising if input is not a string.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows from the validate_input method to the isinstance check, which then may trigger an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and typical for input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class UTFValidator with a static method that checks if the provided input 'text' is a string. If not, it raises an InvalidInputError. The import of InvalidInputError from a local exceptions module is standard. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The logic is simple input validation without external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard input validation utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
