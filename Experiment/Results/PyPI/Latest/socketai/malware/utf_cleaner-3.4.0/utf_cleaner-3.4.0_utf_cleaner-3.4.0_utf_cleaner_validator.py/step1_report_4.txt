  "purpose": "Validator for UTF-8 strings to ensure input is a string type.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text' in the validate_input method.",
  "sinks": "The check 'isinstance(text, str)' and potential raising of InvalidInputError.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is checked; if not a string, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code is straightforward and lacks obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for validating UTF-8 strings by checking if the input is of type str. It raises a custom exception if validation fails. No external data sources or sinks are involved beyond this validation. The code appears to serve a benign purpose. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The code is simple and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic input validation for UTF-8 strings with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
