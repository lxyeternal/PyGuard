  "purpose": "Validate that the input is a string, raising an exception if not.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in validate_input method.",
  "sinks": "Raising InvalidInputError when input is not a string.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is checked for type; if invalid, exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. The class name suggests UTF validation but only checks type.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a custom exception and defines a static method that verifies if 'text' is a string. It raises an exception if not. No external data, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not perform actual UTF-8 validation, only type checking. All reports confirm its benign nature, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward input type validator with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action needed.",
