  "purpose": "Validator for UTF-8 strings to ensure input is a string type.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in validate_input method.",
  "sinks": "Potential exception raising when input is invalid.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is checked for type; if invalid, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No use of external data or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for validating UTF-8 strings by checking the input type. It raises a custom exception if the input is not a string. No external data sources, no network calls, no suspicious code patterns. The code is minimal, straightforward, and appears purely for input validation purposes. It relies on an external exception class, but that alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple input validation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for input validation modules.",
