  "conclusion": "The code exemplifies a high-risk supply chain attack vector by dynamically installing and executing code from an untrusted GitHub repository without validation. The silent error handling further exacerbates the risk. The behavior warrants a malware score of approximately 0.8 and a security risk score around 0.85, indicating a very high potential for malicious activity and system compromise."
