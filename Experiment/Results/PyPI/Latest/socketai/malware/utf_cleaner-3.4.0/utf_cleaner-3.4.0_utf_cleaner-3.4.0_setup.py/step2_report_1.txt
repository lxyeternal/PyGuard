  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard setup script for a Python package, with static metadata, no dynamic code, no external data, and no suspicious behavior.\n- The code imports only 'setuptools' functions and calls 'setup()' with hardcoded parameters.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security risks is found in any report.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n### Confirmed issues in code:\n- The code is straightforward, and all reports agree that there are no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, file I/O beyond setup, or dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in the analysis.\n\n### Scores assigned:\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\nThese are reasonable given the evidence.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely static, with no dynamic or external interactions, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious behavior detected.\n- Obfuscated score of 0 is justified; code is straightforward.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume that static setup code cannot be malicious, which is generally valid.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis is cautious and correct.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The static nature and lack of external interactions justify these scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and thorough. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
