{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'utf-cleaner' Python package, including metadata and package discovery instructions.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata such as name, version, description, author info, URL, and package information via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The flow is static: metadata is assigned to setup() parameters; no dynamic or untrusted data flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup, defines package metadata, and uses find_packages() for package inclusion. All data appears static and intended for package configuration. There are no code injections, malicious behaviors, or external data sources. No unusual patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code strictly performs package setup without any runtime data processing or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for publishing Python packages.",
