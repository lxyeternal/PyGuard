{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'utf-cleaner' Python package, including metadata and package details.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for 'setup()' function: package name, version, description, author info, URL, package list, classifiers, and Python version requirement.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input is directly used in a potentially unsafe manner.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from sources to sinks indicating security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard 'setuptools' setup function without dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and invokes 'setup()' with static metadata for packaging. All data provided is hardcoded and standard for Python package setup scripts. No dynamic code, input validation, or external data sources are present. The code structure is typical and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a normal, benign package configuration.",
