{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the 'utf-cleaner' Python package, specifying metadata and packaging instructions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user input; all data is hardcoded within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code strictly defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package metadata (name, version, description, author, URL, classifiers, and Python version requirements), and invokes setup() with this data. All elements are typical for a Python package distribution. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code sections. No hardcoded secrets or potentially malicious instructions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign configuration for publishing a Python package.",
