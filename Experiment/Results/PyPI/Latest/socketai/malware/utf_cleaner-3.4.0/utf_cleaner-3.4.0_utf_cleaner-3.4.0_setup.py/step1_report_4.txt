  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'utf-cleaner' Python package, including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata such as name, version, description, author, email, URL, classifiers, and Python version requirements.",
  "sinks": "No typical security-sensitive sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow is apparent; data flows are limited to static strings and package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior are detected. The code is standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to configure package distribution, with all inputs being static strings and functions that do not perform any runtime operations involving external data or system commands. There are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup, with no embedded or hidden malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe and legitimate.",
