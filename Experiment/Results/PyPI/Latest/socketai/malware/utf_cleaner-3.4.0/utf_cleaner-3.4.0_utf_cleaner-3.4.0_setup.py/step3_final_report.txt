  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded package metadata in setup() call, including name, version, description, author info, URL, classifiers, and Python requirements.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static code with no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only 'setuptools' functions and calls 'setup()' with fixed parameters. It does not perform any dynamic operations, network activity, or data manipulation. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, standard package setup script. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present. The code's static nature and lack of external interactions justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
