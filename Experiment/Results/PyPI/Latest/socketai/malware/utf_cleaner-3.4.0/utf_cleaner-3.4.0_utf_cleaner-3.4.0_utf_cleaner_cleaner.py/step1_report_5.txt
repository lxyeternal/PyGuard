  "purpose": "A utility class for removing non-UTF characters from input text, with optional multiprocessing support.",
  "sources": "UTFValidator.validate_input(text)",
  "sinks": "UTFLogger.log_removal(text, cleaned_text)",
  "flows": "validate_input reads input -> clean method processes text -> log_removal logs the result",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports utility modules for validation, logging, and processing. It defines a class to clean non-UTF characters from text, using either a multiprocessing handler or a simple generator based on the use_multiprocessing flag. Validation occurs at the start, and logging occurs after processing. The structure and functions appear straightforward and consistent with typical text processing utilities. No signs of malicious payload, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard text cleaning utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs validation, optional multiprocessing, and logging in a normal manner. No vulnerabilities or malware indications are apparent.",
