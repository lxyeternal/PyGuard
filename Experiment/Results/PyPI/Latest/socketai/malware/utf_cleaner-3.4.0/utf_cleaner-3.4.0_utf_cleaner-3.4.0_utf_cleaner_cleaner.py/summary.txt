  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for cleaning UTF characters, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2. I recommend maintaining a low risk score of 0.1 for conservativeness, but overall, the code is safe and well-understood."
