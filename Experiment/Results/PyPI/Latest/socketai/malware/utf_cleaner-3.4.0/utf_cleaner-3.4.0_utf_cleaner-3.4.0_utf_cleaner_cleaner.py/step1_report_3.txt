  "purpose": "A utility class for removing non-UTF characters from input text.",
  "sources": "Input text provided to the 'clean' method, specifically the 'text' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Logging via 'UTFLogger.log_removal', which outputs original and cleaned text.",
  "flows": "Input text -> UTFValidator.validate_input -> filtering characters (either via multiprocessing or direct iteration) -> UTFLogger.log_removal",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Use of multiprocessing is optional but appears standard. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The class validates input, then filters non-UTF characters either through a multiprocessing handler or character-by-character filtering, then logs the removal process. The code relies on external modules for validation, logging, and character checking. No suspicious code, network activity, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward and appears intended for data sanitization.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a UTF character cleaner with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign utility for data preprocessing.",
