  "purpose": "Logger for tracking character removals during string sanitization or debugging.",
  "sources": "Input strings 'original' and 'cleaned' provided to the log_removal method.",
  "sinks": "Logging output that displays removed characters; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Comparison of 'original' and 'cleaned' strings via set difference, then logging the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward set difference operation and logging. No obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging and defines a static method that identifies characters removed from 'original' to 'cleaned' by set difference, then logs these characters. The logic is simple, benign, and intended for debugging or data validation. No external data flows, network activity, or credential handling are present. The use of set difference does not account for character frequency, but this is acceptable for its purpose. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for tracking character removal with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
