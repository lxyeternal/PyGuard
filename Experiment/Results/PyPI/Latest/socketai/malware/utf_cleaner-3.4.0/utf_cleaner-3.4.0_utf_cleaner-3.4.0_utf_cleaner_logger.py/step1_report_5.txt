{
  "purpose": "To configure logging and provide a utility to log the removal of non-UTF characters from input strings.",
  "sources": "Logging configuration setup; the static method log_removal takes 'original' and 'cleaned' string inputs.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs via the logging module; no external data sinks or network transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings 'original' and 'cleaned' flow into the log_removal method, which then logs information about removed characters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard logging setup and a simple string operation.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging with DEBUG level and a specific format. It defines a class 'UTFLogger' with a static method to log characters removed from a string. The method calculates the difference between the original and cleaned strings and logs any removed characters. There are no suspicious or malicious operations, such as network activity, credential handling, or data exfiltration. The code appears to serve a utility purpose without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for logging character removals and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
