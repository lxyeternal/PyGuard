{
  "purpose": "Set up logging configuration and define a class to track removal of non-UTF characters from strings.",
  "sources": "Logging configuration (logging.basicConfig) and the static method log_removal which takes 'original' and 'cleaned' strings as input.",
  "sinks": "Logging via logging.info, which outputs information about removed characters.",
  "flows": "Input strings (original and cleaned) flow into the log_removal method, which calculates removed characters and logs them.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code performs standard logging setup and a utility function for tracking character removals.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module and configures basic logging settings to output debug level logs with timestamps. It defines a class UTFLogger with a static method log_removal that calculates characters removed from an original string to a cleaned string and logs these removed characters if any. The logic appears to serve a tracking purpose, likely for data cleaning or validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious operations. The code does not perform network operations, handle secrets, or execute untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "This code sets up logging and provides a utility for tracking character removal, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and straightforward.",
