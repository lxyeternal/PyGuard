  "purpose": "Configure logging and define a class to log removal of non-UTF characters from input strings.",
  "sources": "Logging configuration setup; log_removal method accessing input parameters 'original' and 'cleaned'.",
  "sinks": "Logging output where removal information is recorded via logging.info.",
  "flows": "Input strings are compared to identify removed characters, and this information is logged.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. Use of set operations and logging is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up basic logging configuration and defines a class with a static method that logs the removal of non-UTF characters. The method calculates the difference between original and cleaned strings and logs any removed characters. No external data fetching, network communication, or hidden behaviors are present. The purpose appears to be character filtering and logging, which is typical and benign. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for logging character removal activity with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign utility for tracking string sanitization.",
