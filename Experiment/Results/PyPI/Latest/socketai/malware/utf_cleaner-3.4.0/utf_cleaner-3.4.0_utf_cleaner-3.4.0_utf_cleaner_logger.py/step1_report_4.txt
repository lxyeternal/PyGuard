{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom logger class to track the removal of non-UTF characters during processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings in the log_removal method via the parameters 'original' and 'cleaned'.",
  "sinks": "The logging.info statement outputs information about removed characters, which could potentially leak information if used improperly, but in this context, it's for debugging/logging purposes.",
  "flows": "Input strings ('original' and 'cleaned') are compared to identify removed characters; the set difference flows from the inputs to the logging sink via the method execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses standard logging and string operations. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging with DEBUG level, which is standard for debugging purposes. The UTFLogger class provides a static method to log non-UTF characters removed from an input string. The method compares the original string with a cleaned version and logs any characters that were removed. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The logging is straightforward and does not include sensitive data beyond character removal info. No suspicious code constructs or obfuscated code are present. The overall design appears benign and intended for debugging or informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for logging character removals, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks are identified based on this snippet.",
