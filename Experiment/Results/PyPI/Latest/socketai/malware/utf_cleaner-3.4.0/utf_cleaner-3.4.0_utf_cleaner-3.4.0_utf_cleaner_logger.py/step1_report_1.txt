  "purpose": "Configure logging and define a class for tracking removal of non-UTF characters in strings.",
  "sources": "Logging configuration at the beginning; static method log_removal accessing 'original' and 'cleaned' parameters.",
  "sinks": "Logging info message with details about removed characters.",
  "flows": "Method log_removal receives 'original' and 'cleaned' strings, computes removed characters, and logs the info message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious external calls or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up basic logging configuration and defines a class with a static method that logs characters removed from a string. It computes the set difference between 'original' and 'cleaned' to identify removed characters and logs this information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, or malicious code. The method seems designed for benign string processing and logging purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward logging utility for character removal tracking, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
