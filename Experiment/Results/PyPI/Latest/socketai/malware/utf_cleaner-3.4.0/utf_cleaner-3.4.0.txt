The silent error handling further exacerbates the risk. The behavior warrants a malware score of approximately 0.8 and a security risk score around 0.85, indicating a very high potential for malicious activity and system compromise."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and security risk should be 0 given the benign nature."
