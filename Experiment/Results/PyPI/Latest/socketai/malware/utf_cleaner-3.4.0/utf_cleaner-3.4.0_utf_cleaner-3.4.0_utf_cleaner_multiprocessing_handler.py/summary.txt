  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for filtering non-UTF characters with multiprocessing. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and security risk should be 0 given the benign nature."
