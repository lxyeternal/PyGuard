{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to filter out non-UTF characters from a given text using multiprocessing to handle large input efficiently.",
  "sources": "Reads input text in the filter_with_multiprocessing method, and the imported is_utf_character function.",
  "sinks": "Returns the filtered text, which could potentially be used downstream for display or storage.",
  "flows": "Input text is split into chunks; each chunk is processed by _filter_chunk; the filtered chunks are combined into the final output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Uses multiprocessing in a straightforward way.",
  "analysis": "The code properly divides input into chunks based on CPU count, processes each chunk in parallel, and joins results. The only external dependency is is_utf_character, which appears to be a utility function for character validation. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is apparent. The multiprocessing usage is standard and does not pose evident security risks. No network activity, data leaks, or suspicious side effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for filtering characters with multiprocessing. No malicious intent or security risks are detected. It performs a benign text filtering task with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
