  "purpose": "Filter non-UTF characters from a text string using multiprocessing for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Input text parameter in filter_with_multiprocessing method",
  "sinks": "None; in-memory processing without external data sinks",
  "flows": "Input text -> split into chunks -> process chunks via _filter_chunk using is_utf_character -> join filtered chunks -> output string",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward implementation, no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code divides input text into chunks based on CPU count, processes each chunk in parallel with _filter_chunk which filters characters using is_utf_character, then recombines the filtered chunks. No external network activity, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The external utility is assumed benign. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious patterns are detected. The multiprocessing approach is standard and safe. The utility function's correctness is assumed but could be reviewed separately.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for filtering non-UTF characters with multiprocessing. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and security risk should be 0 given the benign nature.",
