  "purpose": "To filter non-UTF characters from a given text using multiprocessing for efficiency.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text' in filter_with_multiprocessing method.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code processes data in-memory without external outputs or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is divided into chunks, processed in parallel by _filter_chunk, then recombined.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of multiprocessing is standard for performance.",
  "analysis": "The code divides input text into chunks based on CPU count, then filters each chunk using a multiprocessing pool to call _filter_chunk. The _filter_chunk function uses is_utf_character to determine if characters are UTF-compatible, filtering out non-UTF characters. The code relies on an imported utility is_utf_character, which appears to be a normal helper function. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for text filtering with multiprocessing. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are evident. There are no external data leaks, network activity, or credential handling. The multiprocessing use is appropriate and does not introduce security issues by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a safe, performance-optimized filtering operation for UTF characters. No malicious intent or security risks are detected. It appears to be a standard, benign utility function.",
