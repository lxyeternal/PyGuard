{
  "purpose": "The code provides a multiprocessing utility to filter non-UTF characters from a given text, intended for efficient processing of large text data.",
  "sources": "The source of input data is the parameter 'text' passed to 'filter_with_multiprocessing'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where data leads to potential leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is split into chunks; each chunk is processed by '_filter_chunk' in parallel; filtered chunks are concatenated and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code uses standard multiprocessing and string processing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper function '_filter_chunk' that filters out non-UTF characters using an imported 'is_utf_character' function. The class 'UTFMultiprocessingHandler' contains a static method that divides the input text into chunks based on CPU count, processes each chunk in parallel using multiprocessing Pool, and then joins the results. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious system interactions are present. The code appears straightforward and focused on text filtering performance optimization.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this code. It performs a legitimate text filtering operation using multiprocessing for efficiency. The code appears safe and standard, with no indicators of malware or security threats.",
