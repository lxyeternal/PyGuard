  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code only defines two custom exception classes: `UTFCleaningError` and `InvalidInputError`.\n   - There are no external data sources, sinks, or data flows.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or I/O operations are present.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with `InvalidInputError` providing a default message.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely definitional, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident in the class definitions.\n   - The reasoning is consistent: the code is standard for exception handling and does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No changes are necessary; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes with no execution logic, no data handling, and no network activity, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n   - No malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All claims are based on factual observations; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n   - The code is clearly benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall conclusion**:\nThe code is a standard, benign definition of custom exception classes with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
