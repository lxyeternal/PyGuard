  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely definitional, with no data flows, external inputs, outputs, or suspicious constructs.\n- The code only defines two custom exception classes, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are identified.\n- The confidence scores are all at 1, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**Report 1-5:**\n- The reasoning is consistent and thorough, emphasizing the absence of external data, data flows, or suspicious patterns.\n- The conclusions are that the code is benign and serves as a standard error handling pattern.\n- No anomalies or errors are identified in the logic or reasoning.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- Since the code is very simple, there's little room for malicious behavior. The report's conclusion that it's safe and benign is justified.\n- No need to adjust scores; they are reasonable.\n\n**Challenge points:**\n- If there were any claims implying that defining exception classes could be malicious, that would be unfounded. The reports correctly dismiss such concerns.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made; the analysis remains factual.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is straightforward class definitions with no malicious or security-related issues.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, standard, and contains no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
