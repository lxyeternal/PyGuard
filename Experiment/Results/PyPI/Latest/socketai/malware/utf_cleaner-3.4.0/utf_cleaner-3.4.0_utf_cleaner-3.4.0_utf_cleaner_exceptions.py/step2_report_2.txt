  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code only defines custom exception classes.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, serving as error handling boilerplate.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or dynamic execution.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of security issues.\n\n**Critical points:**\n- Since the code is purely definitional with no execution logic, the security risk is negligible.\n- The default messages and class structures are standard and pose no threat.\n- No assumptions are made about hidden malicious intent; the analysis is consistent.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No further action required.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The code is benign and serves a common purpose in error handling.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0",
