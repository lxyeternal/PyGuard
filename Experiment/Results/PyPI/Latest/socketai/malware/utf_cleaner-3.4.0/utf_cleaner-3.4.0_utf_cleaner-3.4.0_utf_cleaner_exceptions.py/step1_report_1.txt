  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling UTF cleaning errors and invalid input errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading operations are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sink points such as data output, network calls, or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since the code only defines classes without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward class definitions with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. The base class UTFCleaningError is a standard custom exception with no additional logic. The derived class InvalidInputError provides a default message for invalid string input errors. There are no external data reads, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The code is simple and standard for custom exception definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely definitional with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to handle specific error cases related to UTF cleaning but does not perform any actions that could compromise security.",
