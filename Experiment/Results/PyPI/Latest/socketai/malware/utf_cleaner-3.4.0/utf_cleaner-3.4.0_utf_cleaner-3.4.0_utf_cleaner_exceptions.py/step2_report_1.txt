  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions: `UTFCleaningError` and `InvalidInputError`.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n   - No dynamic code execution, data handling, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The code appears to be straightforward and standard for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely definitional with no malicious behavior.\n   - They consistently note the absence of external data handling, suspicious constructs, or obfuscation.\n   - No logical flaws are apparent in the reasoning; the assessments are accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is justified.\n   - The code is benign and contains no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware score is zero across all reports, consistent with the code's content.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard exception definitions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is purely definitional, serving as part of an error handling framework.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is benign, standard, and safe. The reports are accurate in their assessments. No changes are necessary.",
