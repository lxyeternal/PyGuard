  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for UTF cleaning errors and invalid input handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely class definitions with default messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class definitions with no suspicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two exception class definitions, with no external data handling, dynamic code execution, or network interactions. The classes are standard and simple, serving as error handling constructs. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks or contain malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The reports accurately assess the code as safe, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
