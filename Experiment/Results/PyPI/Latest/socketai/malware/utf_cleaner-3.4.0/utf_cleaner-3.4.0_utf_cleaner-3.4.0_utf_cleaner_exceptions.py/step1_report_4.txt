  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling UTF cleaning errors and invalid input errors.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "targets": "No data sinks or output targets; no operations that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows as the code only contains class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base exception class 'UTFCleaningError' and a derived exception 'InvalidInputError'. These classes are standard custom exceptions with no dynamic or external data handling. There are no suspicious operations, no data processing, no input handling, or external communications. The code serves purely as a structure for exception handling, which is typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains standard class definitions for custom exceptions with no malicious behavior or security issues. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. Overall, this code fragment is safe.",
