  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling UTF cleaning errors and invalid input errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code defines classes and their constructors.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; code solely defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is static class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from built-in Exception classes, with no dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity. It appears to be standard boilerplate for error handling related to UTF processing, with no embedded malicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard and safe.",
