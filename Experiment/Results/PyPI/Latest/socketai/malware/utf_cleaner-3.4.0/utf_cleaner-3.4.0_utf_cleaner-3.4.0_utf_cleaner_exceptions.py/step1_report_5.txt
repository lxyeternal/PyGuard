  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling errors related to UTF cleaning operations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading points; only class and exception definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely declares a base exception class and a derived exception class for invalid input errors related to UTF cleaning. There are no data inputs, external calls, or potentially malicious constructs. The exception classes are standard Python code without any suspicious behavior or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for handling UTF cleaning errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a safe, standard coding pattern.",
