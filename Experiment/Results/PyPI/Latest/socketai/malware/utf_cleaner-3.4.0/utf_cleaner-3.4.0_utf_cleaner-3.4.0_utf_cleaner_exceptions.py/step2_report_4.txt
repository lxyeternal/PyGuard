  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only defines two custom exception classes, with no execution logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n   - **Conclusion:** There are no issues or vulnerabilities present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely definitional, with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious or risky behavior, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign malware score = 0, which is justified.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly state that the code is standard and benign.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are raised.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Assessment:\nThe code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and purely definitional.",
