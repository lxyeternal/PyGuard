  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for UTF cleaning errors, specifically a base exception and an invalid input error.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and string representations within the exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only defines exceptions without executing any data handling or I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only declares exception classes and a constructor.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class and method definitions with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. 'UTFCleaningError' acts as a base class, while 'InvalidInputError' is a specialized exception for invalid input cases. The constructor of 'InvalidInputError' provides a default message. There are no external data reads, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to serve as part of a larger error handling framework for UTF-related validation or cleaning operations, but by itself, it does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs no harmful actions, contains no obfuscated or malicious code, and does not expose sensitive information. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
