  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining exception classes for the requests library.\n- No report indicates any dynamic code execution, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The code relies on standard and third-party exceptions, with no suspicious patterns.\n- The only complex method is `__reduce__`, used for pickling, which is standard in exception classes.\n- The reported security risks are minimal or zero, and malware scores are consistently zero.\n- The code appears to be straightforward, well-structured, and intended for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of code**: The code matches the description; it defines exception classes, with no anomalies or malicious logic.\n- **Malicious behavior**: None detected; no signs of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities**: No untrusted data processing, no external network activity, no code injection points.\n- **Scores consistency**: The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis. The security risk scores are low, reflecting the code's benign nature.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The `__reduce__` method in `JSONDecodeError` is standard for pickling support; no security concern.\n- The inheritance from external exceptions (like `urllib3.exceptions.HTTPError`) is normal.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The security risk scores of 0.1 in some reports seem slightly high given the benign nature; they could be lowered to 0.\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall,** the code is a standard, safe implementation of exception classes for the requests library, with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n- The code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose without security concerns.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
