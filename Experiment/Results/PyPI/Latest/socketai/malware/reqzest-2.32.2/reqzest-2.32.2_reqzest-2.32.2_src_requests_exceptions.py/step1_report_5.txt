{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling various error conditions in the requests library.",
  "sources": "The module imports exceptions from urllib3.exceptions and a compatibility layer from .compat; uses built-in and imported exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data; exception classes generally serve error handling purposes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; exception flow is within error handling mechanisms.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for the requests library, mainly inheriting from standard Python exceptions and imported exceptions. It imports external exceptions, extends them with additional context, and implements special methods like __reduce__ for pickling. No input/output handling, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The code is clean, well-structured, and aligns with typical Python exception class definitions. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, non-malicious module defining exception classes for error handling in the requests library. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
