  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling various request-related errors in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for urllib3.exceptions and local compat module; class initializers and methods",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data processing or external data transmission within this code",
  "flows": "Not applicable; exception class definitions and initializations do not involve data flows",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; code consists solely of standard exception class definitions and documentation",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exception classes for HTTP request error handling. It imports external exception classes and defines subclasses with descriptive docstrings. The code also includes a compatibility layer for JSON decoding errors. No data input/output handling, external network interactions, or execution of untrusted code is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The design is standard for exception handling within a library, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for the Requests library with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as error handling infrastructure without external data processing or unsafe operations.",
