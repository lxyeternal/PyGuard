  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling various request errors and warnings in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports from urllib3.exceptions and relative import from .compat; exception class initializations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could be passed to exception arguments or used in pickling (__reduce__ method).",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated with message and context, possibly involving untrusted input; pickling may involve __reduce__ method.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes for error handling with proper inheritance and init methods. The only complex method is __reduce__ for pickling, which is standard. No dynamic execution, code injection points, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The exception classes are typical and do not contain malicious logic. Import statements are straightforward, and the code maintains clarity and security best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of exception class definitions for the Requests library with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It does not include any suspicious or malicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.",
