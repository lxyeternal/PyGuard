  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors and warnings in the requests library.",
  "sources": "The module imports exceptions from urllib3 and a compatibility module for JSONDecodeError.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data can lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code defines exception classes that are used as error handling flow control; no data flow from sources to sinks that cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code consists of class definitions and initializers only.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes inheriting from built-in and third-party exceptions to facilitate error handling in the requests library. No suspicious or malicious logic, data manipulation, or external communications are present. The inheritance structure and the use of standard exceptions suggest legitimate design. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The code is straightforward, defining error classes without any dynamic code execution or external dependencies that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception and warning class definitions for the requests library, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears safe and solely serves as error handling structure.",
