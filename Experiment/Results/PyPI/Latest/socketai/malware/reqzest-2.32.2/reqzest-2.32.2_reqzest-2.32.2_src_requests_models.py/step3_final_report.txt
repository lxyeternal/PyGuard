{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an HTTP request library with an embedded malicious payload that downloads and executes external code.",
  "sources": "The malicious code executes immediately upon module import, decoding a base64 URL, downloading an executable to TEMP, and running it via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executes the downloaded file, leading to remote code execution; the download source is a Dropbox URL decoded from base64.",
  "flows": "The code decodes base64, retrieves a URL, downloads an executable, and executes it without validation, bypassing normal request flow.",
  "anomalies": "The malicious snippet is outside class definitions, runs at import time, and silently executes external code, which is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The embedded code actively downloads and executes external malicious code immediately upon import, representing a supply chain attack. The rest of the code is legitimate. The malicious segment is straightforward, not obfuscated, and bypasses normal security checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a severe malicious payload that actively downloads and executes external code, posing a critical security threat. The rest of the code appears legitimate but is compromised by this embedded malicious snippet.",
