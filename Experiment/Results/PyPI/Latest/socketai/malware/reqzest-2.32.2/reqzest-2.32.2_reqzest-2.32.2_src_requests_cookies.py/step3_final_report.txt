  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for cookie management, extraction, and handling within the requests library, ensuring compatibility with urllib2 and cookiejar.",
  "sources": "Request objects (via MockRequest), response headers (via MockResponse), and cookie data (via create_cookie, morsel_to_cookie).",
  "sinks": "Cookie extraction into jar, header generation for requests, cookie removal, and cookie setting.",
  "flows": "Request data flows into MockRequest, which interacts with cookiejar; cookies are created or extracted via functions; headers are generated for requests; cookies can be removed or merged.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and standard for cookie handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard, well-understood cookie management utilities, including classes for request/response wrapping, cookie extraction, and cookie jar manipulation. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The functions perform expected tasks such as creating, copying, merging, and removing cookies, with proper thread safety measures. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of cookie handling utilities for the requests library. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are justified and align with the code's behavior.",
