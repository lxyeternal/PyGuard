  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility utilities for managing cookies with the requests library, including cookie extraction, cookie jar manipulation, and conversion functions.",
  "sources": "Requests request object headers, URL components, cookie attributes (e.g., 'max-age', 'expires'), and external input through function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Cookie header construction, cookie extraction into jars, cookie creation/modification, and cookie removal functions.",
  "flows": "Input data from requests, URL parsing, and function arguments flow into cookie creation, modification, or removal; cookie data flows into headers or cookie jars; cookies are extracted from responses and stored or sent with requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. No obfuscated code or misleading variables. All functions serve standard cookie management purposes. No network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements cookie handling mechanisms compatible with requests and urllib, including creating, copying, and removing cookies, as well as extracting cookies from responses. It uses standard libraries and appears to follow typical patterns for cookie management. No external network access, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The functions are focused solely on cookie manipulation, with no evidence of covert or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard utility code for cookie management within the requests library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply facilitates cookie handling as intended, with no suspicious anomalies.",
