  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the validity of their scores, and whether any issues or risks are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code provides cookie handling utilities with no malicious intent. It uses standard patterns, no obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (0.1).\n\n- **Assessment**: The report's conclusion aligns with the code content. The functions are standard, and no anomalies are detected.\n\n- **Score Justification**: Malware score of 0 is appropriate; security risk is low. Confidence is high (0.95).\n\n**Verdict**: No issues. The scoring seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The malware score is 0, and security risk is slightly higher at 0.2, possibly due to the functions that manipulate cookies.\n\n- **Assessment**: The functions are purely for cookie management, with no network activity or malicious code. Threading lock usage is standard.\n\n- **Score Justification**: Malware score of 0 is appropriate; the security risk is minimal.\n\n**Verdict**: No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, the code is standard cookie utility code with no signs of malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is 0.\n\n- **Assessment**: The functions and classes are typical for cookie management, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Score Justification**: Malware score of 0 fits; security risk is negligible.\n\n**Verdict**: No issues. The scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: The code provides cookie handling utilities, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is very low (0.1).\n\n- **Assessment**: The functions are straightforward, with no network activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Score Justification**: Malware score of 0 is correct; security risk is minimal.\n\n**Verdict**: No issues. The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to others, the code is standard utility code for cookie management, with no signs of malicious activity. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment**: No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.\n\n- **Score Justification**: Malware score of 0 is appropriate; security risk is low.\n\n**Verdict**: No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Content**: All reports correctly identify that the code is standard, utility-based, and designed for cookie management within the requests library.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's content. No obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Security Risk**: The minimal scores (0.1 to 0.2) reflect the benign nature of the code, which does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or contain hidden behaviors.\n\n- **Logical Flaws**: No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n\n- **Potential Concerns**: No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; all assessments are cautious and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Estimated scores for the code:**\n\n- **Malware**: **0.0** — The code is purely for cookie management with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated**: **0.0** — No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk**: **0.1** — Very low, reflecting the benign utility nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a legitimate, standard utility for cookie handling in the requests library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' scores are justified and consistent with the code content.",
