{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies in the requests library, including CookieJar implementations and cookie extraction functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_internal_utils, compat), standard libraries (calendar, copy, time, threading), and class/method definitions that process HTTP headers and cookies.",
  "sinks": "Methods that manipulate headers, cookies, and request data such as add_unredirected_header(), extract_cookies_to_jar(), get_cookie_header(), set(), and remove_cookie_by_name().",
  "flows": "Cookies are extracted from responses into a jar (extract_cookies_to_jar); cookie headers are generated for requests (get_cookie_header); cookies can be added, removed, or accessed via set(), get(), __getitem__, and related methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code appears standard for cookie handling and compatibility utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of classes and functions to facilitate cookie management in requests, including mock request/response wrappers, cookie extraction, and dict-like access. Functions like extract_cookies_to_jar and get_cookie_header operate on request and response objects, manipulating headers and cookie jars as expected. The cookie creation functions generate standard cookies with optional parameters. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or backdoors. The logic and imports are typical for cookie handling in HTTP client libraries. The overall structure and content are consistent with standard library code, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for cookie management in the requests library, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It provides necessary mechanisms to handle cookies securely and compatibly, without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
