{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility utilities for handling cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, management, and conversion functions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include request objects (e.g., request URL, headers, cookies) and response headers (via response._original_response.msg).",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous sinks include cookie setting/removal (via set_cookie, remove_cookie_by_name), cookie header generation (get_cookie_header), and cookie extraction from responses.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as request URL and headers are processed to create or modify cookies; cookies are extracted from responses and stored in cookie jars; cookie headers are generated for requests; cookies can be cleared or updated based on inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard utility functions with no obfuscated constructs, no hardcoded credentials, no unusual dynamic code execution. The implementation adheres to expected cookie management behavior. No hidden backdoors or privacy violations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility classes and functions for managing cookies, including creating cookies, converting between cookie formats, extracting cookies from responses, and manipulating cookie jars. It uses established patterns and libraries (http.cookiejar, requests) without any signs of malicious activity. The functions perform expected operations such as adding, removing, and merging cookies, as well as handling request and response headers. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads present. The code is consistent with common cookie handling routines and is unlikely to be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie utilities for the requests library, focusing on cookie management, extraction, and compatibility. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected. The code is well-structured and adheres to typical patterns, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
