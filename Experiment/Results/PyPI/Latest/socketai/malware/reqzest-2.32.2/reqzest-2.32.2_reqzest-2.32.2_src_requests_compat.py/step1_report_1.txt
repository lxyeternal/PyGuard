{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling HTTP requests, character detection, and Python version differences, primarily for backwards compatibility and ease of use.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (importlib, sys, collections, http, io, urllib), third-party urllib3, and optional simplejson",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; mainly uses safe standard library functions and imports",
  "flows": "No significant data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; module imports are static and controlled",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code uses dynamic import resolution but in a safe manner. The import logic for character detection and json libraries is standard for compatibility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version detection, optional imports, and compatibility adjustments using standard Python idioms. It safely handles import errors, avoids dynamic code execution, and does not process user input or external data directly. No indications of malicious behavior or backdoors are present. The only dynamic operation involves importing optional modules, which is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly facilitates backwards compatibility and library detection using safe practices.",
