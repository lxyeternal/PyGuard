{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility support for different Python versions and external libraries, particularly for handling import differences and version detection.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (importlib, sys, collections, http, io, urllib), and dynamic importing of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; the code mainly imports modules and defines variables.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code does not process user input or untrusted data streams. No data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. The code only performs standard compatibility checks and module imports. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily concerned with compatibility and version detection. It imports standard modules and tries to resolve optional dependencies like 'simplejson' and 'chardet' without executing untrusted code. No data processing, external network requests, or dangerous operations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. The structure is typical for a compatibility shim module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign compatibility utility module with no malicious intent. It only performs safe imports and version checks, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
