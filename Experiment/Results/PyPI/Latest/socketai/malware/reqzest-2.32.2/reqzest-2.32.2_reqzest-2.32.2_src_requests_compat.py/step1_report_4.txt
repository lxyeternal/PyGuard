{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as managing dependencies like urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, and json modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external libraries (urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, collections, http, io, urllib). Variable assignments and version checks, particularly for urllib3 and Python version detection.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include dynamic import of chardet/charset_normalizer, and the use of untrusted data in URL parsing functions (though these are standard library functions). No direct data sinks for untrusted input found; code primarily performs imports and compatibility handling.",
  "flows": "Code flow involves importing modules and assigning variables based on version detection and import success. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or external communication points.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code performs typical compatibility and dependency handling without obfuscated patterns, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles imports, version checks, and compatibility issues for Python 2/3, urllib3, and character detection libraries. It uses standard practices like try-except for optional modules and version parsing. No code execution based on untrusted input, no network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. Overall, the code appears to be a standard compatibility utility module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a typical compatibility utility module that manages imports and version differences. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign component intended to facilitate cross-version and dependency compatibility.",
