{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as importing various modules such as urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, and standard library components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard library modules (importlib, sys, urllib3, collections, http, io, urllib), dynamic import of chardet/charset_normalizer, optional import of simplejson, and version detection.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted input handling, no network calls, no data leaks, or external data manipulations present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily performs static imports and version checks without data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is mainly compatibility boilerplate with no suspicious or unusual patterns. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution. The code gracefully handles ImportError scenarios.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, library imports, and version checks for compatibility purposes. It attempts to import optional modules and handles ImportError cases without exposing or executing untrusted code. The functions and variables are straightforward, serving compatibility and configuration purposes. There are no network calls, data processing, or other suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard compatibility boilerplate with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, suspicious data flows, or obfuscation. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
