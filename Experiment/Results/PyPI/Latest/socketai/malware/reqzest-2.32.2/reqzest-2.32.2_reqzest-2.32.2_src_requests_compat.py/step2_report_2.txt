  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the validity of their assessments, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The report states that the code is a standard compatibility module, with no malicious behavior, no data flows from untrusted sources, and safe import handling.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. The code performs version detection, optional imports, and compatibility adjustments using safe, standard idioms.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The scores seem appropriate; malware and obfuscated are correctly set to 0, and overall risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe imports, version detection, and compatibility handling without untrusted data processing.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The reasoning is consistent with the code's functionality.\n- No suspicious patterns or malicious intent are detected.\n- The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Focuses on compatibility, version detection, and safe module imports. No data flows from untrusted sources or suspicious code.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The analysis is thorough and correct.\n- The code is standard for such utility modules.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Highlights the import and version detection logic, noting that no untrusted data is processed and no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's purpose.\n- No issues detected.\n- Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Notes dynamic imports and compatibility handling but finds no malicious activity or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The analysis is accurate.\n- The code's dynamic import patterns are standard for compatibility modules.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: Given the code's purpose as a compatibility shim, the risk score of 0 is appropriate. No untrusted data handling, no network activity, and no dangerous operations are present.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard compatibility module with no security concerns. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
