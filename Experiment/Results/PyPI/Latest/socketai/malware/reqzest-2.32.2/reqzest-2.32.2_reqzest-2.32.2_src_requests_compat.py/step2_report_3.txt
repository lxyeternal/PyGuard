  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard compatibility module, handling Python version differences, optional dependencies, and version detection.\n- All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.\n- The code only performs static imports, version checks, and optional module resolution.\n- No external data processing, network activity, or user input handling is present.\n- Dynamic import logic (importlib.import_module) is used safely, as is typical for optional dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Review per Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states that the code is for backwards compatibility, with safe handling of imports.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms benign nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Also consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Reiterates the benign, compatibility-focused nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Notes potential points of concern: dynamic import via importlib, but clarifies these are standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** None detected. All reports agree, and the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** The only possible concern could be dynamic imports, but they are used safely here for optional dependencies, which is common practice and not malicious.\n- **Scores justification:** All reports assign 0 to malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- The code is standard, well-understood compatibility boilerplate.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The dynamic import of optional modules is safe and typical.\n- No external data flows or untrusted input handling.\n\n**Therefore, I agree with the provided scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, standard, and safe. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is a compatibility utility with no malicious or risky behavior. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
