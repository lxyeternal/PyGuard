  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for handling Python version differences, optional dependencies, and safe imports in a Python environment.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports, dynamic importlib calls for optional modules, version detection via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, network activity, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Static imports and version checks, with optional dynamic imports for optional dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; dynamic import usage is standard for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, safe optional module resolution, and version compatibility handling using well-established patterns. It employs try-except blocks for safe imports, version parsing for compatibility, and conditional imports for optional modules like simplejson and chardet. No data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no malicious code are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, standard compatibility utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It employs safe practices and does not process untrusted data or perform network operations. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified and accurate.",
