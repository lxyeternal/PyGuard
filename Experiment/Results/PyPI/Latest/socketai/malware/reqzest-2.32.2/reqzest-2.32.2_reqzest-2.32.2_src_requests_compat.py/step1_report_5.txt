{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling HTTP requests, character detection, and Python version differences in a Python 2/3 compatible manner.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules like importlib, sys, urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, collections, http.cookies, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request, and built-in types.",
  "sinks": "Potential data handling points include import statements, especially dynamic imports, and functions like importlib.import_module, which could be exploited if malicious modules are introduced or manipulated.",
  "flows": "Imports and module resolution flow from module loading to variable assignment. There are no data flows from external inputs to sensitive sinks that would indicate malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains dynamic module resolution and compatibility handling, which are normal in cross-version support code. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module imports and compatibility issues for Python 2 and 3. It dynamically resolves character detection libraries, handles version detection, and sets up imports for JSON parsing and URL handling. No code injection, external data leaks, or malicious logic is observed. The dynamic import of 'importlib.import_module' for optional modules is a standard practice and not inherently malicious. The code does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or suspicious activity beyond setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard compatibility and utility module with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It follows typical patterns for version handling and optional dependency resolution, with no malicious behavior detected.",
