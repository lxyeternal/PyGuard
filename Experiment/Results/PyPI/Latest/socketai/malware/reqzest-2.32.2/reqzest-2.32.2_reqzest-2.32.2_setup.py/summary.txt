  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The primary concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which could be exploited if the version file is compromised. The static os.system() commands are safe in this context. Overall, the script is safe but could be improved by replacing exec() with safer alternatives for loading version data. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting the potential risk of exec()."
