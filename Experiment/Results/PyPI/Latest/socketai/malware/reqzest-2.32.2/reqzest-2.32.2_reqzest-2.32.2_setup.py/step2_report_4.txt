  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The core concern is the use of `exec()` to load the version info from `__version__.py`. This is a known pattern in setup scripts but inherently risky if the version file is compromised or maliciously crafted, as it executes arbitrary code.\n- No evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated/malicious code is present.\n- The use of `os.system()` for publishing commands is standard, though it can be risky if inputs are manipulated—here, commands are static.\n- The rest of the code appears standard for a setup script.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue Confirmation & Code Presence**\n\n- The `exec()` on `__version__.py` is present in the code.\n- No malware, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.\n- The code is typical for a setup script.\n\n**Verdict:** The reported issues are valid. The main concern is the `exec()` pattern, which is present and correctly identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the `exec()` call as a potential security concern.\n- No false positives or misinterpretations.\n- The reports do not overstate the risk; they acknowledge that `exec()` could be exploited if the version file is compromised.\n\n**Verdict:** No logical flaws detected. The reports are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Score Evaluations**\n\n**Malware Score:**\n\n- All reports assign `0` to malware, citing no malicious activity.\n- Given the `exec()` pattern, which could be exploited if the version file is malicious, some might argue for a slightly higher malware score, but as the current code does not include malicious code, the score remains justified at 0.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n\n- All reports assign `0`, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n\n**Security Risk Score:**\n\n- Ranges from 0.2 to 0.4.\n- The main risk is the `exec()` call, which could be exploited if the version file is compromised.\n- The use of `os.system()` for publishing commands is standard and static here, so low risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**\n\n- The reports assign a risk of around 0.2 to 0.4, which is appropriate.\n- A higher score would be justified if there was evidence of malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation, none of which exist here.\n\n---\n\n### **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- No report claims malicious activity beyond the potential risk of `exec()`.\n- The risk is correctly contextualized as moderate, not high.\n\n---\n\n### **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n\n- All reports are consistent.\n- They correctly identify the `exec()` as the main concern but do not attribute malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Expert Assessment**\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0** (no malicious code present)\n\n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n\n**Estimated risk score:** **0.2** (minor concern due to `exec()`, but standard practice)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The main security concern is the use of `exec()` to load version info. If the version file is kept secure and unaltered, the risk remains low.\n- Consider replacing `exec()` with safer alternatives, such as importing the version module directly or reading the version string without executing code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                | No malicious activity or code detected                     |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                | No obfuscation present                                       |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2              | Potential risk from `exec()` if version file compromised   |\n\n**The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.**",
