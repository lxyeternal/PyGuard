  "purpose": "Setup script for configuring package metadata, dependencies, and publishing commands for the Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__version__.py' via exec(), reads README.md for long description, and environment variables for Python version check.",
  "sinks": "exec() executes code from version file; os.system() runs shell commands for publishing.",
  "flows": "exec() source: '__version__.py' content -> exec() -> sets version variables; os.system() source: static commands -> shell execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info; static os.system() commands for publishing; no input validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks with the notable pattern of executing code from a version file, which could be malicious if the file is tampered with. The os.system() calls are static and not influenced by external input, posing minimal risk. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are present. The main security concern is the exec() pattern, which could be exploited if the version file is compromised. The rest of the code is typical for a setup script, with dependency declarations and metadata configuration. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with these observations, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.2-0.4) due to the exec() pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The primary concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which could be exploited if the version file is compromised. The static os.system() commands are safe in this context. Overall, the script is safe but could be improved by replacing exec() with safer alternatives for loading version data. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting the potential risk of exec().",
