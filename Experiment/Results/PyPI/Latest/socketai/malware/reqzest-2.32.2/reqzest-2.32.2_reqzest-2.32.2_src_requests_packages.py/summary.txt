  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility shim that manipulates sys.modules for module aliasing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The low scores for malware (0), obfuscated code (0), and security risk (~0.1) are appropriate given its purpose and implementation."
