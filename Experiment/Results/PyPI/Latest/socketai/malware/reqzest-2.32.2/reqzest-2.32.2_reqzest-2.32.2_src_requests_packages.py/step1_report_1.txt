  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by aliasing certain packages within the requests package namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statements and references to sys.modules, which access imported modules and package information.",
  "sinks": "Modification of sys.modules entries, which could influence how modules are accessed or loaded later in the program.",
  "flows": "Import packages -> Insert into sys.modules -> Reassign sys.modules entries for compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and sys.modules manipulation is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code’s main purpose is namespace aliasing for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific packages ('urllib3', 'idna') and places them into the local namespace. It then updates sys.modules to alias these modules under 'requests.packages'. If 'chardet' is available, it similarly updates sys.modules to alias 'chardet' and its submodules under 'requests.packages'. The purpose is to ensure compatibility with older code expecting these packages under a certain namespace. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity. The code relies on standard Python import and sys.modules manipulation, which is common for backward compatibility patches.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a backward compatibility utility that reassigns modules within sys.modules for namespace consistency. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected. The manipulation is benign and intended solely for compatibility purposes.",
