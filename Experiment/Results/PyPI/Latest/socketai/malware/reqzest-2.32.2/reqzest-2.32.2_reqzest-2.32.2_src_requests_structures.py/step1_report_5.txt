{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), item access (__getitem__), update method, and any method that manipulates or accesses internal storage (_store or __dict__).",
  "sinks": "Methods that retrieve data (__getitem__, get, lower_items), and __repr__ methods that output data representations.",
  "flows": "Input data in constructor or update flows into internal storage; data is retrieved via __getitem__, get, or iteration methods, returning stored values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or backdoors detected. The code is straightforward data structure implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard case-insensitive dictionary behavior with case-sensitive keys stored internally. The logic follows typical patterns for such data structures, with no signs of malicious behavior. The LookupDict is a simple extension of dict with a custom __repr__ and __getitem__ that accesses __dict__, which is standard. No external data injection, code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data structures used for managing headers or lookup tables in HTTP requests. There are no malicious components or security risks detected. The code appears safe and free of malware or malicious behavior.",
