  "purpose": "To provide the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "targets": "The output of the script, which is the CA bundle location; no other data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "The script calls 'where()' from certifi and prints its result; there are no untrusted data flows or data processing paths.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code constructs present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from certifi, a standard package for CA bundles. It then outputs the CA bundle location when executed directly. No user input, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. The code's purpose is to report a configuration path, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscated behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, non-malicious, and serves a legitimate purpose related to SSL certificate management. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
