{
  "purpose": "This module provides the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the certifi package.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs the CA bundle path, which could potentially be used for informational leaks but is not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'where' from certifi and outputs its result; data flow is straightforward with no untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors detected; the code is simple and standard for its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the certifi package and prints the path to the CA bundle when executed directly. It serves as a utility to display the default CA certificates used by requests. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The code is minimal and aligns with standard practices for handling CA certificates.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily serves a utility function to display a CA bundle path.",
