{
  "purpose": "The code imports 'where' from the 'certifi' package and prints its value when executed directly, providing the default CA certificate bundle path.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from certifi import where'; the call to 'where()' in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' -> call to 'where()' -> output via print.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of a trusted library without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimal and relies on the reputable 'certifi' library to retrieve the CA bundle path. When run, it simply prints this path. There are no untrusted inputs, network activity, or data manipulation. The code's purpose is benign and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility that outputs the trusted CA bundle path. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.",
