  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Imports 'where' from certifi; reads the default CA bundle path when executed.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only outputs a file path, with no untrusted data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code simply prints a static resource location without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward usage of a known library function, no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a well-known, reputable library (certifi) to retrieve the CA bundle path. It only prints this path when run directly. No user input, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign function of returning a standard CA bundle path. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility script.",
