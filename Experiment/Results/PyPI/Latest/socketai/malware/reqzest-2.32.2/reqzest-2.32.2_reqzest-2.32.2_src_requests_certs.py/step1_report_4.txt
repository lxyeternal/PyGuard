{
  "purpose": "This module provides the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' library.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the certificate bundle path; no untrusted data or sensitive info is involved.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function is called and its output is printed to standard output; no external or untrusted data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function from a well-known, trusted library and outputs its result. There are no input sources that could be malicious, no data flows leading to sensitive sinks, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The module appears to be a straightforward utility for retrieving the CA bundle path.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for returning the certifi CA bundle path, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
