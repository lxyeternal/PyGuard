  "purpose": "This code defines static metadata variables for the 'requests' Python package, serving as package information and documentation.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only static variable assignments for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow, external communication, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment of metadata variables without data input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code contains only decorative ASCII art comments and metadata variables, with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward package metadata with no executable logic, data processing, or external communication. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The ASCII art is purely decorative. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as package metadata for 'requests'. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
