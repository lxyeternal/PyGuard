{
  "purpose": "Defines metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and other information.",
  "sources": "Constants and string assignments at the beginning of the module",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing or external data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static metadata",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines package metadata variables with static string and integer values. No input handling, no data transmission, and no executable logic are present. It appears to be standard package metadata boilerplate, typical for Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata for the 'requests' package with no malicious intent or security issues. It is standard and safe.",
