{
  "purpose": "The code performs dependency validation, version checks, and environment setup for the requests library, ensuring compatibility and fallback configurations.",
  "sources": "Version strings from imported libraries, environment detection (e.g., ssl, cryptography), and import statements.",
  "sinks": "Warnings and assertions that validate environment and dependencies; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Version strings and environment checks lead to assertions and warnings; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for version validation, which could cause runtime errors but are standard for dependency checks; no malicious patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for dependency validation and environment configuration. It includes version assertions, optional imports, and fallback mechanisms for SSL support. No external input, network activity, or suspicious code is present. Assertions serve to enforce correct versions but do not introduce malicious behavior. Warnings are used appropriately for deprecated or incompatible dependencies. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and intended for environment integrity, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical dependency validation and environment setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's purpose. The malware score is correctly zero, obfuscated score is zero, and the low risk scores reflect the benign nature of the code. The overall security posture is very low risk.",
