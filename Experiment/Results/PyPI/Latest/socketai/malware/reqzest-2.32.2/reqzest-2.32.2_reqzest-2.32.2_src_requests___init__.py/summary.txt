  "conclusion": "The code is a typical dependency validation and environment setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's purpose. The malware score is correctly zero, obfuscated score is zero, and the low risk scores reflect the benign nature of the code. The overall security posture is very low risk."
