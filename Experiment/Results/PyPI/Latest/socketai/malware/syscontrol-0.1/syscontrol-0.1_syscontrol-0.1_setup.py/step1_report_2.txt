  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for packaging the 'syscontrol' Python library.",
  "sources": "None; the code only imports modules and defines setup parameters without reading external input.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no functions or code that handle untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the script only sets package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with static package metadata such as name, version, description, author, classifiers, and python_requires. The code is straightforward, standard for Python packaging, and contains no dynamic or malicious elements. No input handling, no external data processing, and no code execution beyond standard setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears to be safe and standard.",
