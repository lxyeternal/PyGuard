{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script is used to package and distribute the Python library 'syscontrol'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package information such as name, version, packages list, description, author, classifiers, and Python version requirements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leakage; the script only defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the package configuration parameters into the setup() function, which uses this data to create a distributable package.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, standard setup configuration without suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with static, hardcoded package metadata. There are no inputs from external sources or dynamic code execution. No environment variables, user inputs, or network activities are involved. The code is typical for Python package distribution and contains no malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a standard package configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
