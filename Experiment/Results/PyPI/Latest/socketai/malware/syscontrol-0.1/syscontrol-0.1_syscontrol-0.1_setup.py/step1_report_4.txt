{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'syscontrol' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call: package name, version, description, author, classifiers, and Python version requirement.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the setup script only declares metadata and package configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only processes predefined static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior detected. The script is a standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with predefined parameters, including package metadata and requirements. All values appear static and typical for a Python package setup. There are no indications of malicious code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The author field contains a generic name, and no sensitive information is present. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py is a normal package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
