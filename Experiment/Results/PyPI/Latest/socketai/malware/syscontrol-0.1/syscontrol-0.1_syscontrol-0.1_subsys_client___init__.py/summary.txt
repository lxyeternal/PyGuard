  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify the core anomaly: the use of exec on decoded base64 payload in status(), which is a significant security concern. The obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware suspicion should be elevated to reflect the high likelihood of malicious intent. The overall security risk is high due to the potential for executing hidden malicious code. The pattern warrants treating this code as potentially malicious until further payload analysis is performed."
