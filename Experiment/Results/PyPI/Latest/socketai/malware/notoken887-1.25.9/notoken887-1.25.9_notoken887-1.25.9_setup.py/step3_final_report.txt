  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution, including name, version, author, contact info, description, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for package name, version, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "None; static configuration without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org' as unprofessional and provocative contact details.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup script using setuptools with no dynamic or executable logic. The only anomalies are unprofessional contact info, which do not constitute malicious code or obfuscation. No data flows or security vulnerabilities are present. The contact info could be used maliciously outside this context, but the code itself is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2 due to suspicious contact details, which is reasonable. The overall assessment confirms the package is safe but unprofessional contact info should be replaced for best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign with suspicious contact info that does not indicate malicious behavior. Scores are appropriate; no malware or obfuscation detected. The minor security risk stems from unprofessional contact details, not code behavior.",
