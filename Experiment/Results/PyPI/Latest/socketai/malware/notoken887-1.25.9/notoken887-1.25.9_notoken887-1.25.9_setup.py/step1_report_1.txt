  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "User input: package name, version, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data (metadata) used during package setup; no flow from untrusted source to critical sink; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a suspicious email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org' which are unusual and potentially malicious or provocative. No code obfuscation or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It defines package metadata with no dynamic or executable code. The author email and URL are unconventional and potentially malicious or offensive. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The content appears to be straightforward package metadata, with some potentially malicious or provocative contact information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with unusual contact info that may be considered suspicious. No malicious code or malware is present. The primary concern is the inappropriate email and URL, which could be used for malicious purposes outside the scope of this script.",
