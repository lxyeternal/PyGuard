{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific function or task in a Python environment, potentially involving data processing or utility operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from standard input, environment variables, or external libraries; specific data sources are not explicitly detailed.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or external command executions, if present; no explicit unsafe operations are identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like output or external systems; no suspicious flow patterns are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments are observed; the code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly, including imports, data handling, function definitions, and execution flow. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. Usage of third-party libraries is standard; no unsafe code patterns or obfuscated segments are detected. The overall structure is typical for legitimate Python scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured Python script without malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
