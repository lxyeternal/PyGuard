  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with appropriate scoring. Report 2's obfuscation and dynamic execution traits justify higher suspicion, but without confirmed malicious payloads, the scores remain cautious. Slightly increasing malware and risk scores for Report 2 could improve accuracy, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, with no evidence of malicious sabotage."
