{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a basic utility or library function, but the specific intent cannot be determined definitively due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources (if present in the actual code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, file writes, network transmissions, or system commands that could be exploited if untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through processing functions and then to sinks like output or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow were detected. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The review examined all sections of the code, including import statements, data processing, and output sections. No suspicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, network connections to suspicious domains, or data exfiltration was observed. Use of third-party libraries is not suspicious by itself. There are no signs of malware like system damage, backdoors, or unauthorized data collection.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign and does not contain suspicious or malicious behavior.",
