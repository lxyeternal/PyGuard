  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential input points include dynamic code execution (eval/exec), environment variables, network connections, and data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows to system commands, network endpoints, or file system modifications; dynamic execution points are critical sinks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as obfuscated code or eval/exec lead to sinks like system calls or network communication, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Significant obfuscation (high obfuscation score), dynamic code execution without clear context, hardcoded secrets, or unusual import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits minimal obfuscation and no suspicious behavior in most reports. Report 2 shows obfuscation (0.7) and dynamic execution, raising suspicion. Scores are generally aligned with the described behaviors. Given the traits, a malware score of 0.4 is justified, but considering the potential for more malicious payloads, increasing it to around 0.6 could be warranted if further analysis confirms malicious intent. Other reports are benign, with scores appropriately low. Overall, the risk is moderate mainly due to Report 2's traits, but no confirmed malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with appropriate scoring. Report 2's obfuscation and dynamic execution traits justify higher suspicion, but without confirmed malicious payloads, the scores remain cautious. Slightly increasing malware and risk scores for Report 2 could improve accuracy, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, with no evidence of malicious sabotage.",
