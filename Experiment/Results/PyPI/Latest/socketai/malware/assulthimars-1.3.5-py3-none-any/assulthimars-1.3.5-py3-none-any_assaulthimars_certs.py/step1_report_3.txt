{
  "purpose": "This module returns the path to the default CA certificate bundle using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location from certifi's 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The code prints the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The source 'where()' provides the CA bundle path, which is then printed directly to output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code uses standard, well-known libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from certifi, which provides the trusted CA bundle path. It then prints this path when executed directly. The logic is simple, static, and relies on a trusted package. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated behavior. No external inputs are processed, reducing attack surface. Overall, it functions as a utility to display CA bundle location without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that outputs the CA bundle path from certifi. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and poses no security threats.",
