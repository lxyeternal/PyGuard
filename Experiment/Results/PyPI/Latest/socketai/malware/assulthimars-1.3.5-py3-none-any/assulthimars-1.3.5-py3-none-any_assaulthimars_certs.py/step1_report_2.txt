  "purpose": "This module provides the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'where' function from the certifi package, which returns the path to the CA bundle.",
  "sinks": "The code prints the CA bundle path; no untrusted data handling or external inputs are involved.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'where' and then prints its value; data flow is straightforward from import to output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard library function from 'certifi' and outputs its result. The code is simple, does not process untrusted input, and only outputs a known file path. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that outputs the default CA bundle path. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security issues.",
