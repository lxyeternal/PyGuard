{
  "purpose": "Return the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package; calling 'where()' in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path, which is a benign operation; no data leaks or external network interactions.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'where' and then outputs its result when executed directly. No external input influences the flow; the 'where' function retrieves a static resource path.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior present. The code is straightforward and serves a simple purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script's purpose is to output the path to the CA certificate bundle provided by the 'certifi' package. It imports the necessary function and uses a standard main guard to print the result. There are no external data sources, no untrusted inputs, no network activity, and no malicious constructs. The code appears to be a minimal utility script, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script intended to display the CA bundle path. There is no malicious behavior, no malicious code, and no security risks identified. It is safe and straightforward.",
