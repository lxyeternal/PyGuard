{
  "purpose": "Provides the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package",
  "sources": "Import statement from certifi module; execution of where() function",
  "sinks": "The print() function outputs the CA bundle location to stdout",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where() -> print() output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward usage of a well-known library function",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports the 'where' function from the certifi package and prints its output when executed as a script. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or manipulate data in suspicious ways. The code's purpose aligns with standard practices for handling CA bundles. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The use of certifi is common and trusted for managing SSL certificates. Overall, the script is a minimal utility with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to output the location of the default CA bundle provided by certifi. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
