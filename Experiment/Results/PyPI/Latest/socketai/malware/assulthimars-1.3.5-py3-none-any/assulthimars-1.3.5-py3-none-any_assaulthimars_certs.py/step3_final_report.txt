{
  "purpose": "Outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' and the call to 'where()' function.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' -> call to 'where()' -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and simple.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints its value when executed directly. It does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious or malicious code. The purpose is benign—to identify the location of the trusted CA bundle. The code is clear, uses a trusted package, and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. Confidence is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that safely outputs the CA bundle path. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk present. The scores assigned are accurate and justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
