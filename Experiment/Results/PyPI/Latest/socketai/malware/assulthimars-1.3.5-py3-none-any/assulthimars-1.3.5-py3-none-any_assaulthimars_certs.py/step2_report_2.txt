  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, importing `where` from `certifi` and printing its value.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform network calls, or contain hardcoded secrets.\n- The purpose is solely to output the path to the CA bundle, a benign utility function.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- Confidence is high (1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n- Obfuscated: 0, aligns with the code clarity.\n- Malware: 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- Security risk: 0, aligns with the benign purpose.\n\n**Critical review:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis correctly identifies the script as a benign utility.\n- The code is not malicious, does not contain backdoors, or perform any suspicious operations.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- The scores seem reasonable and well-justified.\n- No changes needed; the assessment aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Additional note:**\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, these scores are appropriate.\n- There is no indication of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal, benign utility that safely outputs the path to the CA bundle provided by `certifi`. The scores assigned are accurate and justified. No further action is necessary.",
