{
  "purpose": "This script provides the location of the default CA certificate bundle used by requests for SSL verification, primarily by returning the path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the 'where' function import.",
  "sinks": "The script outputs the result of 'where()' to standard output.",
  "flows": "Input source is the certifi package's 'where()' function; the output flows to the console via 'print()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the script is straightforward and relies on a well-known package.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'where' from the certifi package to determine the default CA bundle path. When run directly, it prints this path. There are no hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. It functions as a utility script to identify the CA bundle location. The code is simple, clear, and uses standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves a specific utility purpose, and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use.",
