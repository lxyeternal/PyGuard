{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility and utility functions for handling cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, management, and conversion between different formats.",
  "sources": "Request objects (via MockRequest), response headers (via MockResponse), cookie data (via functions like cookiejar_from_dict, morsel_to_cookie), external inputs such as cookie dictionaries and cookies in merge_cookies.",
  "sinks": "Cookie extraction into cookie jars, setting, deleting, and merging cookies, and producing cookie headers for requests.",
  "flows": "Input request or cookie data → functions like extract_cookies_to_jar or cookiejar_from_dict process data and populate cookie jars → get_cookie_header produces cookie headers for requests → cookies can be manipulated via set, delete, or merge functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code. The code mostly performs standard cookie handling. The only potential concern is the permissive handling of cookies via set() and merge(), which could be exploited if untrusted cookie data is introduced, but this is standard behavior for cookie management libraries and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements cookie handling utilities for the requests library, including mock classes to mimic request and response objects, cookie extraction, and management functions. The functions follow typical patterns for cookie handling without suspicious logic or external data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or code injections are present. The use of thread locks for cookie storage is standard for thread safety. Overall, the code performs legitimate cookie management tasks without any malicious behavior or sabotage indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides standard, non-malicious cookie management utilities for the requests library. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is well-structured for its purpose, and there are no signs of supply chain attacks or malicious sabotage.",
