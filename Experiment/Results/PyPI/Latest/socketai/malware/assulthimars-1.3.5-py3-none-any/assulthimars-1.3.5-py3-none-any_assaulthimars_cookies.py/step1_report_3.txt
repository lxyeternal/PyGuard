{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility utilities for managing cookies with the requests library, including classes and functions for cookie extraction, manipulation, and transfer between different cookie representations.",
  "sources": "Requests request objects, response objects, and cookie data structures such as Morsel, HTTP headers, and dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Cookie header construction, cookie extraction into CookieJar, cookie removal, and cookie copying functions. The main data flow involves creating, updating, or removing cookies based on request and response data.",
  "flows": "Request data is wrapped by MockRequest for cookie handling; responses are wrapped by MockResponse for header parsing; cookies are extracted via extract_cookies_to_jar; cookies are added or removed via set, get, or remove_cookie_by_name; cookies are converted between Morsel and Cookie objects; cookies from dictionaries are integrated into CookieJar; cookies can be merged from different sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as obfuscated code, hidden network communications, or direct data exfiltration. The code relies on standard library functions and typical cookie management operations. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. No dynamic code execution or suspicious external calls are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of cookie management utilities designed to support the requests library, with compatibility classes and functions for handling cookies, headers, and cookie jars. It handles cookie extraction, creation, removal, and merging in a conventional manner. No code appears to perform malicious actions such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or hidden network activity. The functions are standard, and their purposes are well-documented, indicating normal operation. Overall, the code appears to serve its purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for cookie management within the requests library ecosystem. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It performs expected operations for handling cookies and related data structures. Therefore, it is considered safe.",
