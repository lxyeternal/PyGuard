  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for managing cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, setting, deletion, and conversion between different cookie formats.",
  "sources": "Reading request URL, headers, and cookies; extracting cookies from response; converting Morsel to cookie; creating cookies from dicts.",
  "sinks": "Adding cookie headers to requests; modifying cookie jar (set, delete, update); extracting cookies from responses.",
  "flows": "Request data (URL, headers) -> cookie extraction or setting -> cookie jar updates -> cookie header generation for requests",
  "anomalies": "Use of mock classes to emulate cookie-related objects; no obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls; standard cookie management functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive set of cookie management utilities aligned with the requests library's needs, including extracting cookies from responses, generating cookie headers, and managing cookie jars. All functions operate within expected boundaries for cookie handling, with no indications of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The mock classes facilitate compatibility but do not perform any malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious external communications are present. The functions are straightforward and primarily manipulate data structures for cookie management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of cookie handling utilities used in the requests library for managing cookies across HTTP requests and responses. There are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It is a utility module supporting cookie operations, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
