  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions with the code, and assess the scores and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Compatibility utilities for cookie management in requests.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: The report states the code is standard, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious external calls.\n- **Confidence**: 0.95\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Security Risk**: 0\n\n**Assessment**: The code is a utility module for cookie handling, using mock classes and functions to manage cookies. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are evident. The report's conclusion aligns with the code's functionality.\n\n**Verdict**: The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Similar to above, focusing on cookie handling, with emphasis on functions like extraction, merging, and cookie creation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: No malicious code, just standard cookie management. Slight concern about handling untrusted cookie data, but this is typical for such libraries.\n- **Confidence**: 0.9\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Security Risk**: 0.2\n\n**Assessment**: The code performs expected operations for cookie management. The slight security risk score (0.2) reflects potential issues if untrusted data is introduced, but this is inherent to cookie handling libraries, not an indication of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict**: The malware score remains at 0, which is correct. The security risk score is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Compatibility and utility functions for cookies, similar to previous reports.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: No malicious behaviors, no suspicious code, no external communications.\n- **Confidence**: 0.95\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Security Risk**: 0\n\n**Assessment**: The code is a straightforward utility for cookie handling, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Utility functions for cookie management, with classes and functions for extraction, creation, and manipulation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no backdoors. The code is a standard utility module.\n- **Confidence**: 1\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Security Risk**: 0\n\n**Assessment**: The code's purpose is clear, and no malicious indicators are present.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Compatibility utilities, similar to others.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: No malicious or sabotage code; functions perform expected cookie handling.\n- **Confidence**: 1\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Security Risk**: 0\n\n**Assessment**: The code is a standard utility layer with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation\n\n- **Malware Scores**: All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's purpose and analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Scores**: All reports assign 0, and the code is clearly readable and standard.\n- **Risk Scores**: Mostly 0, with a slight 0.2 in one report, justified by the inherent risks of cookie handling untrusted data.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security Risk Score**: **0.1 to 0.2** — minimal, due to the potential for untrusted cookie data, but this is typical and not malicious.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe code is a legitimate, standard implementation of cookie management utilities used in the requests library. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's functionality. No evidence of supply chain compromise, malicious code, or sabotage exists.\n\n**Final Recommendation**: Keep malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and security risk at around 0.1–0.2, reflecting the normal risks associated with cookie handling but nothing malicious.",
