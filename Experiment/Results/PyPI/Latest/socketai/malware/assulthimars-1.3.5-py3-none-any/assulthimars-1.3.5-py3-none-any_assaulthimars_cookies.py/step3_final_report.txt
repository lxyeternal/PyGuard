  "purpose": "Utility functions for cookie management, including extraction, conversion, header creation, and cookie jar operations within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Functions reading data from request objects, response headers, and cookie jars; classes wrapping request and response objects for compatibility.",
  "sinks": "Methods generating headers, extracting cookies into jars, and manipulating cookie data; no external network calls or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Request objects provide URLs and headers to mock request classes; cookie data flows into cookie jars; headers generated for requests from cookie jars.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Mock classes are for compatibility and do not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard cookie management utilities, including classes for request/response wrapping, cookie extraction, creation, merging, and management. No external network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The functions operate within expected parameters for cookie handling in the requests library. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are accurate. The risk scores in some reports are slightly elevated but justified by the inherent risks of handling untrusted cookie data; however, these are typical and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of cookie management utilities used in the requests library. There are no signs of supply chain compromise, malicious behavior, or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), reflecting typical risks associated with cookie handling but no malicious activity.",
