  "purpose": "Ensure backward compatibility by aliasing specific packages and their submodules, and preserve their identities within sys.modules for requests package compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads the sys.modules dictionary and the chardet module if imported.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.modules entries to alias packages under 'requests.packages.*'. No external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Imports packages, then assigns sys.modules entries to create aliases for these packages and their submodules under 'requests.packages.*'.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs dynamic manipulation of sys.modules, which can be risky if malicious modules are present. However, it is standard practice for backward compatibility, not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific packages ('urllib3', 'idna') and reassigns their entries in sys.modules under a nested namespace 'requests.packages.*'. It does this to preserve identity and compatibility. Additionally, if the chardet module is imported, it similarly aliases its submodules under 'requests.packages'. This dynamic sys.modules manipulation is common in legacy compatibility layers but could potentially be misused if malicious modules are present. No external data or network interactions occur. The code does not include any obfuscated or suspicious logic beyond standard aliasing for compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility shim that manipulates sys.modules to maintain legacy package references. It contains no malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It operates solely within Python's module system. Risks are limited to potential namespace pollution but not malicious intent.",
