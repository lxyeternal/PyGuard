  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by aliasing 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet' modules under 'requests.packages' namespace via dynamic import and sys.modules manipulation.",
  "sources": "Imports of 'urllib3', 'idna', and optionally 'chardet'; reading these modules' __name__ attributes.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to sys.modules entries under 'requests.packages.*', which could affect module resolution in the environment.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are assigned to sys.modules['requests.packages.<module>'], enabling legacy code to access these modules via the 'requests.packages' namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual manipulation of sys.modules for namespace aliasing; no external data or network activity; straightforward code but with potential for misuse if malicious modules are introduced.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and reassigns them within sys.modules under a different namespace for backward compatibility. This pattern is common in legacy support but can be exploited if malicious modules are present. No malicious payloads or network activity are present. The code is simple and clear, with no obfuscation. The manipulation of sys.modules is the main point of concern, but in this context, it appears benign. The malware score is 0, as no malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the namespace manipulation potential but no active threat.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a compatibility shim, performing namespace aliasing for legacy support without malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate; malware is absent, obfuscation is not present, and the security risk is minimal but should be acknowledged in environments where namespace manipulation could be exploited. Overall, the code is benign with low security concern.",
