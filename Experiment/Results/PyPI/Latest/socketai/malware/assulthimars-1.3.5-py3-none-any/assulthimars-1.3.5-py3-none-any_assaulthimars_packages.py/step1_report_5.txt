  "purpose": "Maintain backwards compatibility by aliasing certain packages under 'requests.packages' namespace.",
  "sources": "Reading imported modules ('urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet') from sys.modules.",
  "sinks": "Assigning modules to sys.modules under new names, affecting module namespace and import resolution.",
  "flows": "Modules are imported and then re-mapped in sys.modules to preserve compatibility, especially under the 'requests.packages' namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual namespace manipulation and re-mapping of modules, which could be used to mask or hijack modules; no explicit malicious code or external data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports specific third-party modules ('urllib3', 'idna') and reassigns them within sys.modules under a 'requests.packages' namespace. It also conditionally does this for 'chardet' if present, replacing its references to maintain compatibility. This pattern is typical in older libraries to maintain compatibility across different versions of dependencies. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The module re-mapping is a form of namespace aliasing, which is not inherently malicious but could be misused if altered for malicious purposes. Overall, the code appears to serve a compatibility purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is for maintaining compatibility by re-mapping third-party modules into the 'requests.packages' namespace. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The module manipulates sys.modules for namespace aliasing, which is a common pattern in legacy code but should be reviewed for potential misuse. Overall, the risk is low.",
