{
  "purpose": "Provide case-insensitive dictionary data structures used for HTTP headers and lookup purposes in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, method parameters, and internal data storage.",
  "sinks": "Dictionary operations that access or modify internal state; no external sinks or untrusted data outputs detected.",
  "flows": "Input data (initialization, updates) flows into internal storage; dictionary key lookups and modifications access this internal data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations are present. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious intent detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two dictionary-like classes: CaseInsensitiveDict, which manages case-insensitive string keys with proper case preservation for output, and LookupDict, a simple dictionary wrapper with a custom __repr__. Both classes operate solely on internal data structures without external data leaks, network access, or system modifications. The code follows standard patterns for dictionary subclassing and does not perform any malicious operations or contain hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code implementing case-insensitive dictionaries for request headers and lookup storage. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and non-suspicious.",
