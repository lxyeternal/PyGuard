{
  "purpose": "This code appears to implement a Python HTTP library called 'ModernReqs', providing functions for making HTTP requests such as GET and POST, and handling dependencies and compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "Dependencies imported from standard libraries, third-party modules (urllib3, charset_normalizer, chardet, cryptography, ssl), and embedded base64-encoded code executed via exec()",
  "sinks": "The base64-encoded code executed through exec() potentially acts as a sink, executing arbitrary code. Other sinks include imports, warnings, and the usage of network-related modules for HTTP operations.",
  "flows": "The embedded base64 code is decoded and executed, possibly leading to malicious code execution. The code flow involves dependency checks, conditional imports, and network requests. The exec() call creates a direct source-to-sink flow where untrusted code could be executed.",
  "anomalies": "The use of exec() with base64-decoded data is suspicious and could hide malicious payloads. The code also includes multiple dependency checks and warnings, but the core concern is the embedded exec() call. The rest of the code is standard for an HTTP library.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a docstring describing the library's purpose. It then imports modules, performs dependency and version checks, and attempts to configure SSL and fallback mechanisms. The critical concern is the exec() call executing base64-encoded code, which is not justified by the surrounding context. This indicates potential malicious intent or sabotage, as arbitrary code is being executed without transparency. The rest of the code appears to be legitimate setup and import statements typical of a Python HTTP library.",
  "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the embedded base64-encoded code executed via exec(), which could be malicious. The rest of the code appears to be standard library setup and dependency management. Due to the exec() with encoded payload, the overall malware score is high, and security risk warrants caution.",
