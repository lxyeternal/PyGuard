  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors and warnings in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Exception classes and their initialization methods, especially the __init__ methods and attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "Potential exception handling points, where untrusted data could influence exception behavior or propagation.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes with arguments, setting of attributes like 'response' and 'request', and inheritance-based error propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or hidden behaviors. Use of standard exception handling patterns. No code injecting or exfiltration activities detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple exception classes inheriting from built-in and third-party exceptions. The __init__ methods set attributes based on provided arguments, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data manipulation. No suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. The inheritance structure and class definitions follow standard Python practices for error handling. The presence of warning classes is also normal. Overall, the code appears to be a typical, well-structured set of exception definitions for a HTTP request library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for the Requests library with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It maintains typical design patterns for error handling without any suspicious anomalies.",
