{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for the Requests library to handle various HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "The code imports exceptions from urllib3 and a compatibility module, and defines custom exception classes. No input sources from user or external untrusted data are present.",
  "sinks": "Exception classes and error handling mechanisms are defined, but no direct sink points like network calls or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code establishes class inheritance hierarchies for exception handling but does not involve data flow from sources to sinks. No dynamic data flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. The code is purely structural, defining exceptions and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of class definitions for exceptions used in the Requests library. It imports exceptions, extends classes with custom error messages, and includes detailed docstrings. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or data processing occurs. The structure is standard for defining exception hierarchies. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class definition module for handling HTTP and connection errors in the Requests library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intentional for its purpose.",
