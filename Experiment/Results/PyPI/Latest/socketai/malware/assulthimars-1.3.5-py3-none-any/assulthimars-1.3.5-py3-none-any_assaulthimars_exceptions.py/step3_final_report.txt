{
  "purpose": "Defines a comprehensive set of exception and warning classes for the Requests library, facilitating error handling during HTTP operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and .compat modules; class constructors initializing response and request attributes.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling points where these classes are instantiated or caught during request failures.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects during error conditions; attribute access for response and request objects.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward class definitions with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions and warnings used in the Requests library. It imports standard modules and defines constructors that set attributes like response and request. No network activity, data manipulation, or obfuscated code is present. The inheritance hierarchy and structure are typical for error handling modules. The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or contain malicious payloads. The exception classes serve to categorize errors during HTTP requests, and the warning classes handle deprecation and dependency issues. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and free of security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of exception and warning classes for the Requests library. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and justified.",
