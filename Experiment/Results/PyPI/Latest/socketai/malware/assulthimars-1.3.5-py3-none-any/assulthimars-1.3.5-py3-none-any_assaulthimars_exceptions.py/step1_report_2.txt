  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for the requests library to handle various HTTP errors and warnings.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and .compat modules; class definitions; initialization methods.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising and handling in HTTP request processing; no evident data sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects during error conditions in HTTP requests, propagating errors up the call stack.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; all classes are standard exception definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic observed. No code execution or network activity within this module.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for exception handling within the requests library. It imports standard exception classes and defines subclasses for specific HTTP and connection errors, as well as warnings. There are no external data sources, sinks, or data flows that could indicate malicious activity. The code is straightforward, primarily used for error categorization and reporting. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard set of exception classes for handling HTTP request errors and warnings. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
