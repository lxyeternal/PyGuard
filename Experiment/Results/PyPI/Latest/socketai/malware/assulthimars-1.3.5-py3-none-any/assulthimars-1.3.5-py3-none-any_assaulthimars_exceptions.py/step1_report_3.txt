{
  "purpose": "This module defines various exception classes used by the Requests library for handling HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and local compat module. No other input sources.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling and instantiation. No data leakage or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Exception objects are created and propagated during HTTP request failures, errors, or timeouts.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No malicious patterns like network communication, file access, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes for error handling within the requests package. It imports standard exception classes and extends them with no external input processing, no suspicious network or system calls, and no obfuscated or hidden code. The structure is typical for a library error module. No code appears to perform any malicious activity or sabotage. No embedded payloads, no suspicious imports beyond standard libraries, and no data leaks or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a standard exception hierarchy for the requests library. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and typical for error handling in a HTTP client library.",
