  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines a comprehensive set of exception classes for the Requests library, inheriting from standard Python and third-party exceptions.\n   - The `__init__` methods primarily set attributes like `response` and `request`.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data manipulation is present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The class hierarchy and import statements are standard.\n\n2. **Comparison with Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is a typical, well-structured set of exception classes.\n   - No suspicious behaviors, malicious patterns, or anomalies are identified.\n   - The reports assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code content.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity, code injection, or backdoors are present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — No security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are detected.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation:**\n   - The code is purely structural, defining exception classes used for error handling.\n   - No external inputs, network activity, or code execution paths that could be exploited.\n   - The inheritance and class design follow standard patterns.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes needed; the analysis aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis is a typical error handling module with no security concerns.",
