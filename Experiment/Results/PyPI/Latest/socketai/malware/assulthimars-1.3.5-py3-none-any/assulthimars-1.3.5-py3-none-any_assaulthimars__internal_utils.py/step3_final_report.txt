  "sources": "Input strings passed to to_native_string and unicode_is_ascii functions.",
  "sinks": "Decoding of input strings in to_native_string; validation regex patterns applied to headers.",
  "flows": "Input strings are decoded or validated via regex; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of decode on potentially untrusted input in to_native_string; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code provides regex patterns for header validation and functions for converting and checking strings. No network calls, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The regex patterns are standard. The decode operation on untrusted data is typical but could pose risks if misused, though in this context it is benign. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The only minor point is the decoding of untrusted input, which is standard in request handling but should be used cautiously in broader contexts. The security risk score can be considered very low (around 0.1), but overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible.",
