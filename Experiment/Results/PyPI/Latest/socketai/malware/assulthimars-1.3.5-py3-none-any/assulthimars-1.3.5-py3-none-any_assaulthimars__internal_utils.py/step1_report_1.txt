  "purpose": "Utility functions for internal use in the Requests library, mainly for header validation and string handling.",
  "sources": "import statements, regex pattern definitions, function parameters",
  "sinks": "string decoding and encoding, regex matching, function returns",
  "flows": "input strings are checked or decoded, then returned or validated via regex",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No network activity, no obfuscated code, and no data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides helper functions for string manipulation and validation. The regex patterns enforce header name and value formats, which are standard. The 'to_native_string' function decodes bytes to strings using ASCII or specified encoding, and 'unicode_is_ascii' checks for ASCII-only strings. Both functions are straightforward, with no external network calls or sensitive data handling. No malicious behavior or sabotage indicators are present. The code is well-structured, typical for utility functions, and contains no suspicious anomalies or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module intended for internal request handling. It contains no malware, no malicious intent, and poses no security risks.",
