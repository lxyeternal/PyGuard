  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is utility functions for internal use, with regex for header validation and string handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external effects.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirms benign utility functions with standard regex and string operations. No external network or data leaks.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, notes standard regex and string decoding, ASCII check. Mentions potential concern about decoding untrusted input but clarifies no execution or external effects.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1 — slightly elevated but justified given the decoding of untrusted data, which could be risky if misused, but the code itself does not execute or leak data.  \n- **Justification:** Since the function decodes potentially untrusted input without validation or sanitization, there is a minimal risk, but not enough to warrant a higher risk score.  \n- **Recommendation:** Keep risk at 0.1, as the code itself is benign but decoding untrusted data can be a concern in some contexts.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Confirms standard header validation and string handling, no external or malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, confirms straightforward utility functions with no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code. I agree with 0 for all.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree on 0.  \n- **Risk score:** Most reports are 0, with one at 0.1 due to decoding untrusted input.\n\n**My own assessment:**  \n- The code is standard utility functions with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.  \n- The only minor concern is the decoding of untrusted data in `to_native_string`, which could be exploited if the decoded data is used insecurely elsewhere, but within this code, it’s just decoding, which is benign.\n\n**Therefore, I suggest:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (as per the third report, justified by the decoding of untrusted data, but not a serious vulnerability)\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n- The scores given in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior.  \n- No changes needed unless a broader context reveals how the decoded data is used elsewhere, but within this snippet, it remains benign.\n\n**Summary conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign utility module with minimal security concern, primarily around the decoding of untrusted input, which is a common pattern in request handling but should be used cautiously in the larger application context.",
