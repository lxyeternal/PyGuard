  "purpose": "Utility functions for internal use within the Requests library, mainly for header validation and string conversions.",
  "sources": "Reading string inputs from parameters in to_native_string and unicode_is_ascii functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; functions return values based on input processing, no untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input strings are validated and converted; no external data flow or command execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for header validation, provides a string conversion function that decodes byte strings using a specified encoding, and checks if a Unicode string is ASCII only. The functions use standard Python practices and do not perform any external calls, network operations, or unsafe evaluations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration are evident. The use of regex for validation and simple encoding/decoding routines are typical for such utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign utility implementation with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs input validation and conversion tasks commonly needed in HTTP headers management. No malicious behavior or supply chain vulnerabilities are detected.",
