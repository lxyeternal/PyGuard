  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The only minor point is the decoding of untrusted input, which is standard in request handling but should be used cautiously in broader contexts. The security risk score can be considered very low (around 0.1), but overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible."
