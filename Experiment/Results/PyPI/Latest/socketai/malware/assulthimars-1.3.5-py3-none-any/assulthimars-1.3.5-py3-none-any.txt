The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), reflecting typical risks associated with cookie handling but no malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits a highly suspicious pattern of executing a base64-encoded payload via exec(), which is a red flag for malicious activity or sabotage. The high malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is elevated. Further decoding and analysis of the payload are necessary to confirm malicious intent, but the current pattern warrants serious caution."

      "conclusion": "This code serves as a compatibility shim, performing namespace aliasing for legacy support without malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate; malware is absent, obfuscation is not present, and the security risk is minimal but should be acknowledged in environments where namespace manipulation could be exploited. Overall, the code is benign with low security concern."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The only minor point is the decoding of untrusted input, which is standard in request handling but should be used cautiously in broader contexts. The security risk score can be considered very low (around 0.1), but overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible."
