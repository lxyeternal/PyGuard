{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility and utility functions for handling imports, version differences, and character detection for the requests library, ensuring smooth operation across different Python versions and environments.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as importlib, sys, urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request, and built-in type definitions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains sinks that process untrusted data or perform operations that could leak data or execute malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports modules and defines compatibility functions without any data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs version detection and module import resolution but does not include any suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The dynamic import attempts are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly handles compatibility issues, such as Python version detection and optional module imports (like simplejson and chardet). It also defines utility functions and variables for version checks and module availability, which are typical in cross-version Python packages. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The logic is straightforward, aiming for compatibility rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious intent, supply chain sabotage, or security risks in this code. It appears to be a standard compatibility layer for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities identified.",
