  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code content.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a compatibility layer handling imports, version detection, and optional dependencies.\n- No dynamic code execution, no user input, no network operations, and no data processing that could be malicious.\n- All import statements are standard and well-understood.\n- The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Compatibility utilities, import management.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. The code is purely for compatibility.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Compatibility functions, import handling.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No security issues.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Compatibility, URL handling, character detection.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent, standard import resolution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No risks detected.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Compatibility, version detection, module imports.\n- **Assessment:** No data flow from untrusted sources, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The code is safe.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Compatibility, environment detection.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity, standard setup routines.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign compatibility layer with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Are the reasoning and conclusions reasonable?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly interpret the code as standard, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware.\n\n- **Are the scores appropriate?**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**Additional note:** The code is a typical compatibility module, common in many Python projects, and does not contain any hidden or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n- No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n- The code is entirely benign from a security perspective.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis.",
