  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code manages compatibility and import handling.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or sensitive operations are involved.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code is standard, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The version detection and optional dependency imports are common practices.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** The scoring seems appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description of compatibility functions and import resolution.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows or sinks indicating malicious activity.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Clearly benign.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes compatibility and utility functions for URL handling and character detection.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard compatibility code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on compatibility and environment detection.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No sensitive data or malicious operations.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.  \n- **Conclusion:** Typical compatibility layer.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes environment setup and compatibility.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows or malicious operations.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard setup code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are 0 across all reports.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, all are at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature—no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), which is justified given the straightforward, compatibility-focused code.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis code is a standard compatibility module with no security risks or malicious intent.",
