{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility utilities for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and manages imports for various standard libraries and third-party dependencies related to HTTP requests and data handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules like importlib, sys, urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, collections, http.cookiejar, http.cookies, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that execute untrusted data; potential indirect influence if imported modules are malicious or tampered with, but no explicit security-sensitive sinks are present",
  "flows": "The code attempts to import optional dependencies and handle version detection, with no data flows leading to insecure operations",
  "anomalies": "None detected; the code is primarily compatibility and import management without unusual or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles compatibility by importing modules conditionally and defining utility functions. It detects urllib3 version, resolves character detection libraries, and imports various standard modules safely. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no data manipulation that could be malicious. The code’s structure is standard for a compatibility layer, with no suspicious behaviors or obfuscated parts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign compatibility module used to facilitate smooth operation across different Python versions and dependency environments. No malicious intent, no security risks identified.",
