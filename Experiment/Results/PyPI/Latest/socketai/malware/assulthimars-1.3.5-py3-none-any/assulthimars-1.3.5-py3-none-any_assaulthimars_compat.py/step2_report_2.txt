  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the provided assessments.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a compatibility layer handling imports, version detection, and optional dependencies.\n- The code primarily performs static imports, version checks, and library detection.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network operations are present.\n- The code does not manipulate data in a way that could be malicious.\n- The import statements are standard and do not suggest malicious modules are being loaded.\n- The reports unanimously assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, with security risk also at 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code matches the descriptions: it's a compatibility and import management module with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and non-malicious.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score (0):**  \n  Correct. No malicious activity or code is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score (0):**  \n  Correct. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score (0):**  \n  Appropriate, given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- **Any assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they recognize the code as a compatibility layer. This is accurate.\n\n- **Are the scores consistent?**  \n  Yes. All scores align with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard compatibility utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The overall assessment remains that this code poses no security threat.",
