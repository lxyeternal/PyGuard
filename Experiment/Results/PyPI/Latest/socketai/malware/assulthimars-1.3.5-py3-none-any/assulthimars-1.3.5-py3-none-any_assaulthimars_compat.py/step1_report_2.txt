{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as imports related to URL handling and character detection libraries.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (importlib, sys, urllib3, simplejson, json, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request) and internal functions for detecting character encoding libraries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected. The code primarily performs imports and compatibility adjustments.",
  "flows": "The code initializes variables and imports modules; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors present. The code appears standard for compatibility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code performs import resolution and compatibility handling between Python versions, detecting library versions, and selecting appropriate modules for JSON and character encoding. It uses try-except blocks for safe imports and version detection, which are standard practices. No user input, network communication, or data manipulation occurs, and no suspicious code is present. The structure is clear, and the logic is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical compatibility and import utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and contains no suspicious behaviors or malware indicators.",
