{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling URL requests, character detection, and Python version differences in a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as importlib, sys, urllib3, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request, and conditional imports of simplejson/json.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains direct sinks that process untrusted user input into critical operations like database queries, network requests, or file operations. Import statements themselves are not sinks unless they import malicious modules, which is unlikely here.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports modules and defines functions for version and library detection, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code behavior, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward, focusing on compatibility and library detection.",
  "analysis": "The code performs compatibility checks and imports, including version detection for urllib3, dynamic module import for character detection libraries, and conditional imports for json/json and HTTP handling modules. These are standard practices for ensuring compatibility across environments. No potentially malicious behavior or malicious code patterns are identified. All imported modules are common and well-understood. The functions and variables defined are for configuration and detection, not for executing untrusted data or executing malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a well-structured, typical dependency management code segment intended for cross-version support. No malware or security threats are detected.",
