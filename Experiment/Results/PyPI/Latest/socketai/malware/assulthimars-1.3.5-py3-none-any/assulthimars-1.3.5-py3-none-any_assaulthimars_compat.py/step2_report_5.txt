  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily about compatibility: importing modules conditionally, detecting library versions, and setting up environment variables.\n- No dynamic code execution, no data manipulation, no network operations, and no handling of untrusted input.\n- The import statements are standard, well-understood, and do not appear malicious.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The code does not perform any sensitive operations that could be exploited.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Compatibility utilities, import management.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, benign compatibility layer.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's nature. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Compatibility functions, import handling.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, straightforward logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no security concerns.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Compatibility, URL handling, character detection.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; code is benign.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Compatibility, version detection, module import resolution.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Compatibility, environment detection.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious activity, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard compatibility module, common in many open-source projects, and does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Confirm all scores as 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
