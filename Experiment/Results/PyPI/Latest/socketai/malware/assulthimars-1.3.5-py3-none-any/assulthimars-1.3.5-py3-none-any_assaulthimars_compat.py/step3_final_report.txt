  "purpose": "Compatibility utilities for handling import issues, version detection, and optional dependencies across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Standard import statements, version info checks, optional module imports (e.g., chardet, simplejson).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "Static import and version detection flows; no dynamic or untrusted data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward compatibility management through static imports, version checks, and optional dependency resolution. It does not execute untrusted code, handle user input, or perform network operations. All modules used are standard and well-known. The logic is simple, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility layer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are consistent with its straightforward, utility-focused nature.",
