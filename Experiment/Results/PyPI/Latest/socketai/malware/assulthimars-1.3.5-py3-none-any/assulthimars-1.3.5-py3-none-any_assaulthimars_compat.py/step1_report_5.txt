{
  "purpose": "This module handles import compatibility issues across different Python versions and third-party libraries, mainly for backwards compatibility and environment detection.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module, sys.version_info, urllib3.__version__, import statements, environment variables (implicitly via import), and package imports.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code only imports modules and assigns variables, with no data processing or network operations.",
  "flows": "The code loads modules based on availability and environment detection but does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The version detection logic is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs compatibility and environment setup tasks: detecting urllib3 version, resolving character detection library, conditional imports of json/simplejson, and Python version checks. These are typical setup routines with no evidence of malicious intent. No user input handling or network operations that could be exploited. All operations are standard for a utility module intended for compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility and environment setup module without malicious intent or security risks. It only performs standard imports, version detection, and environment checks, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
