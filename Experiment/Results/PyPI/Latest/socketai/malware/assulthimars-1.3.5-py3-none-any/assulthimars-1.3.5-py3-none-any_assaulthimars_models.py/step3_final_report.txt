{
  "purpose": "The code implements core classes and functions for handling HTTP requests and responses within the Requests library, including URL parsing, header validation, body encoding (including multipart), cookie management, hook registration, and response decoding.",
  "sources": "URL input, headers, data, files, cookies, hooks, and response raw stream.",
  "sinks": "Request components (headers, URL, body, cookies), response content, and response headers.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into request construction, URL parsing, header validation, and body encoding; response data flows into decoding, parsing headers, and response object creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or covert data exfiltration points detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an HTTP client component, utilizing common libraries and practices. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The request and response handling follow expected patterns, with proper error handling and data encoding. External dependencies are standard, and no covert channels or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure part of the Requests library, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are consistent with the code's functionality and structure.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
