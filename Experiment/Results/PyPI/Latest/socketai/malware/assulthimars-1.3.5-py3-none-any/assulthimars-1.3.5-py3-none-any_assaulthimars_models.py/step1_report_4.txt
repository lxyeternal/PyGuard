{
  "purpose": "This module contains classes and functions related to constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as URL, headers, data, files, cookies, and hooks, as well as from request bodies and response streams.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the request body (body, json, data, files), headers, cookies, and response content (content, raw stream).",
  "flows": "Data flows from source inputs (e.g., user parameters, URL, cookies) into request preparation methods, constructing request bodies, headers, and cookies; then into network transmission, and finally into response processing and content consumption.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. Use of external libraries appears standard. The code handles JSON encoding, URL parsing, and multipart form data encoding properly. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. Hooks and cookie handling are standard. No network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are found. No insecure eval, exec, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for HTTP request creation and response handling, including URL encoding, header validation, body preparation (including multipart encoding), cookie handling, and response parsing. The code uses standard libraries and follows typical patterns for HTTP client implementation. There are no indications of malicious data leakage, network exfiltration, or backdoors. All data flows appear intended for legitimate HTTP operations. The response class manages content decoding and streaming securely. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior in the code structure or logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of HTTP request and response handling as part of the Requests library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It primarily performs request construction, encoding, and response processing in a typical manner.",
