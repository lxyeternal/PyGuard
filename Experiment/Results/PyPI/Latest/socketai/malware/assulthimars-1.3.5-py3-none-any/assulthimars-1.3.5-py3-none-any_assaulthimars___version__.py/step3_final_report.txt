  "purpose": "Static package metadata variables with decorative comments and emojis, no malicious code or dynamic behavior.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.), decorative comments, Unicode emojis.",
  "sinks": "None; no external input, network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Unicode emojis and provocative description string ('Stop live in Ukraine')—not malicious but unusual; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata, decorated with ASCII art comments and emojis. No dynamic code, external input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The Unicode emojis are decorative, and the description string, while provocative, does not pose a security threat. The code is straightforward and benign. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are consistent with the code's nature. The high confidence levels are justified given the simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as package metadata with decorative comments. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The existing assessments and scores are appropriate and accurate.",
