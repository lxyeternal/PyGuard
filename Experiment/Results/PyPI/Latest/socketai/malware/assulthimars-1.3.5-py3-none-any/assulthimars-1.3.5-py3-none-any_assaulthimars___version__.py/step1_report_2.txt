{
  "purpose": "Define metadata attributes for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string and integer values assigned to metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks related to untrusted data or potential data leaks; no network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code solely sets static variables; no data flow from input to output is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains ASCII art comment block, which is harmless. All metadata fields are hardcoded; no suspicious or malicious patterns are evident. No dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a comment block with ASCII art and a series of metadata variable assignments, including title, description, URL, version, build number, author, email, license, copyright, and an emoji string. All data appears static and intended for package description purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration. No external dependencies or suspicious code constructs are present. The variables are simple string and integer assignments, typical for package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward package metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It is benign and solely provides descriptive information about the package.",
