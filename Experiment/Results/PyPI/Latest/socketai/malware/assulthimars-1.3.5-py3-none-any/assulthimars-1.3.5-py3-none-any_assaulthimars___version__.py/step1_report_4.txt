  "purpose": "Defines metadata variables for a Python package or module, such as title, description, URL, version, author, and license information.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting string and numeric values for metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; code only assigns static values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "The comment contains ASCII art that appears unrelated to the code purpose. The description 'Stop live in Ukraine' is unusual and potentially controversial or provocative, but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively assigns static metadata variables, with no external data input, network activity, or dynamic execution. The ASCII art comment does not influence code behavior. The description string is unusual but not malicious in isolation. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard metadata declaration for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The unusual description is noted but does not indicate malicious activity.",
