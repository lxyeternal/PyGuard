  "purpose": "Define metadata for a Python package or module, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and decorative emojis.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting module-level variables (__title__, __description__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or used in a harmful manner.",
  "flows": "Simple variable assignments with no data flow from external or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art and emojis, but these are purely decorative. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward variable assignments establishing package metadata. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The use of emojis and ASCII art appears decorative and does not contribute to malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to set metadata variables. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
