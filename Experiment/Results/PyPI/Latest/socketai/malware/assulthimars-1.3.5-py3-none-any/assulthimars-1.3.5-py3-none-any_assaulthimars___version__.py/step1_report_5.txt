  "purpose": "Define metadata for a Python package or module, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "None of the variables are assigned from external input; all values are hardcoded string or numeric literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to external systems, no code execution, network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only assigns static metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "The initial ASCII art comments are purely decorative with no executable impact; all other code is static assignment. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments setting package metadata. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no use of dangerous functions or data flows. The ASCII art is non-executable and decorative. The metadata fields appear standard and benign. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as metadata declaration for a Python package or module, with no malicious or suspicious content. It appears benign with no security concerns.",
