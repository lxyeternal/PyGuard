  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a configuration script for Sphinx documentation, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The main concern revolves around the `github_link` function, which constructs URLs based on release info and user input.\n- No report mentions actual network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The code relies on standard modules and project-specific functions (`get_version`) to retrieve version info.\n- The environment variable `app.config.release` is used to determine the release version, which is typical in such configurations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious routines, network activity, or backdoors.\n- The dynamic URL construction in `github_link` is standard practice for documentation linking.\n- Use of `app.config.release` is typical for retrieving project version info.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The reliance on `app.config.release` assumes that the environment is correctly configured; misconfiguration could lead to incorrect URLs but not security issues.\n- The use of `packaging.version.parse(release).is_devrelease` is standard for distinguishing dev releases.\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n### Scores and justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (configuration for documentation), the overall security risk is minimal. I would assign **0.1** to reflect the minor concern about dynamic URL generation based on environment variables, but this is standard practice.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The reports' confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate.\n- The reports' security risk scores are low (around 0.0 to 0.1), consistent with the code's purpose.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (since it involves dynamic URL construction based on environment variables, but no actual security risk)\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard Sphinx configuration script for Flask documentation, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The use of environment variables and dynamic URL creation is typical for such scripts and does not pose security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score | Justification                                                  |\n|------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious activity or payloads detected                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Code is clear and straightforward                                |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1          | Minor risk due to dynamic URL generation based on environment, but standard practice |\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
