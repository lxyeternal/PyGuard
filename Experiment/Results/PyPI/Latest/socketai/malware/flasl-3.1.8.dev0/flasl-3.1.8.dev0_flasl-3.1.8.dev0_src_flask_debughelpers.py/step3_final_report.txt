{
  "purpose": "Provides debugging utilities, custom exceptions, and request handling enhancements within a web framework, primarily for error reporting and template diagnostics.",
  "sources": "request.form, request.files, loader.__dict__, request_ctx.request.blueprint, app.logger",
  "sinks": "Exception raising, class modification of request.files, logging output",
  "flows": "Request data (form, files) to exception handling; loader info to logs; request object patched for better error messages",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic subclassing of request.files.__class__ for improved error reporting; unconventional but intended for debugging",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions for request errors, patches request.files.__class__ to provide clearer error messages during multipart form data issues, and logs template loader attempts for diagnostics. The class patching is a known debugging pattern, not malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The code's purpose is solely to aid debugging and error reporting, with no signs of malicious intent or payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as debugging utilities for a web framework. The class patching is a debugging aid, not malicious. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), justified by the unconventional class patching but within safe debugging practices.",
