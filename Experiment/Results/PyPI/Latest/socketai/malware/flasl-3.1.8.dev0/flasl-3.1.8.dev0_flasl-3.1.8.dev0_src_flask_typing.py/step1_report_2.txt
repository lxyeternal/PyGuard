  "purpose": "Type annotations and type alias definitions for Flask/Werkzeug request/response handling and application callback functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing, and optional type checking imports.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code defines types only.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains type annotations and imports; no executable logic, input handling, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type aliases for Flask and Werkzeug request/response lifecycle functions and data structures. It includes conditional imports for type checking and defines various response and callback types. No data handling, network operations, or security-sensitive code is present. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior; this appears to be a standard, safe type annotation module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type annotation setup for Flask/Werkzeug applications, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It is a safe, purely declarative module with no signs of malware or security issues.",
