{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations, type aliases, and type variables for Flask/Werkzeug request and response handling to facilitate static type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing module, and conditional imports for type checking (e.g., WSGIApplication, Headers, Response). No runtime data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or transmit data at runtime, only declares types.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static type definitions with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present. The code is straightforward type aliasing and type variable declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static type annotations for Flask/Werkzeug components, including response types, request handlers, and hooks. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or network operations. The use of conditional imports for type checking is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the code's static, benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of type annotations for a web framework, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
