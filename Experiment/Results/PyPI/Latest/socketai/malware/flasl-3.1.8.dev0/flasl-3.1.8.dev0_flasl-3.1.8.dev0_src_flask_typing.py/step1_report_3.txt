  "purpose": "Define type annotations and aliases for various Flask/Werkzeug HTTP response types, request handlers, and lifecycle hooks.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, type aliases, and imports used for type checking and code clarity.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code primarily defines types and does not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input to critical functions; primarily static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. Use of type checking imports and annotations is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for type annotations and defines multiple type aliases for HTTP response and request handler functions, response data types, and lifecycle hooks used in Flask/Werkzeug applications. All constructs are standard for static type hints. No data is read or written, and there are no functions executing untrusted data or performing actions outside of type definitions. The code does not contain any dynamic execution, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical static type annotation setup for a Flask/Werkzeug project. It does not perform any runtime operations, data processing, or network interactions. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
