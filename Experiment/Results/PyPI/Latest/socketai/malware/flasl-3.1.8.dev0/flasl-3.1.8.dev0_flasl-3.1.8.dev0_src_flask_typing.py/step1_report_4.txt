{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and callable types for use in a web framework, likely Flask or Werkzeug, for request/response handling, middleware, and routing.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and imports from standard library, Werkzeug, and Flask-related modules; type variables and type hints.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; primarily type annotations and definitions without runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "Type definitions do not execute data flow; no runtime source-to-sink data paths; purely static type hints.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; standard type aliasing and import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, imports, and type alias definitions for a web framework. It uses standard Python typing features, conditional imports for type checking, and no runtime logic or data manipulation. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. The code is purely for static type hinting, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions intended for static type checking in a web framework. It shows no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
