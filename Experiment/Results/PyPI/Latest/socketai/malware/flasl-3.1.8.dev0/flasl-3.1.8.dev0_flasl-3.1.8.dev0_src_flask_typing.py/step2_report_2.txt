  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports consistently state that the code is solely for static type annotations and contains no runtime logic, data handling, or network operations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n- The type annotations are standard and follow common practices for Flask/werkzeug type hinting.\n- No evidence of data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, nor any suspicious behavior.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- The code is purely declarative, defining type aliases, type variables, and unions to facilitate static type checking.\n- No data is processed or transmitted at runtime.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The use of conditional imports for type checking is standard and safe.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since the code is purely for type annotations and does not perform any security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or concerns:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- No changes are necessary; the scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard type annotations)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no runtime logic or security implications)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, safe set of type annotations for a Flask/werkzeug project. It contains no malicious or security-risk elements. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- No further action needed.\n- The code is benign and purely for static type checking purposes.",
