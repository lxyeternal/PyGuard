  "purpose": "Define type annotations and type aliases for various Flask/werkzeug HTTP response and request handling components.",
  "sources": "Type annotations for response values, headers, request/response handlers, and callback functions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly defines types and annotations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; purely static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is standard for type annotations; no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type alias and type variable definitions using Python's typing module, intended to aid static type checking for a web framework (likely Flask or Werkzeug). It imports optional types for conditional imports under type checking, defines multiple union types for responses, headers, and callback functions, and creates type variables for generic response classes. There is no runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling present. The code is consistent with standard type annotation practices and contains no signs of malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type definitions for web response handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or network communication that could be exploited. The code appears to be purely for static type checking support.",
