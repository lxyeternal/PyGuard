  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard implementation of class-based views, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score aligns with the analysis; no issues are found.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. The malware score is correctly zero, given no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, standard web framework patterns, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Justification:** Slightly lower risk score, consistent with the absence of issues.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard request dispatching, no signs of malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior; the risk score is justified.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Standard pattern, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Justification:** No concerns; the low risk score matches the analysis.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; typical web framework code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or high risk.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports are 0, which is consistent with the analysis indicating no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the absence of obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable given the code's nature as a web framework component.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code appears to be a standard, open-source web framework component implementing class-based views.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' reasoning.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, due to the potential for misuse if subclasses are malicious, but the base code itself is safe)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scoring aligns well with the code analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
