{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Blueprint class for Flask applications, extending SansioBlueprint, with methods to serve static files, open resources, and determine cache age settings.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (os, typing, datetime) and local modules (.cli, .globals, .helpers, .sansio.blueprints, .sansio.scaffold). No external untrusted input sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (open), data returned by functions, configuration access (current_app.config), method calls that could be manipulated indirectly through configuration.",
  "flows": "Configuration values influence methods like get_send_file_max_age; static files served via send_from_directory; resource files opened through open_resource method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code relies on external configuration for behavior, which is typical for web app components.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines a Flask blueprint with standard methods for static file serving and resource management. There are no suspicious network calls, data leaks, or malicious patterns. Usage of open() is limited to local file access with controlled paths. Configuration values influence cache behavior but are not hardcoded. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution features are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of Flask blueprint functionalities with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to typical patterns without suspicious or malicious code.",
