{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Blueprint class for a Flask-like web application framework, extending functionality for static file serving and resource management.",
  "sources": "Configuration settings (current_app.config['SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT']), method parameters (filename, resource, mode, encoding), imported modules, class attributes",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory function call, open() function calls for resource files",
  "flows": "Configuration value -> get_send_file_max_age() -> send_from_directory; method parameters -> open_resource() -> open()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution. No network activity, no suspicious data leaks or obfuscated code. Usage of open() for file reading appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions and methods for handling static files and resources in a web application. It accesses configuration data securely, uses standard library functions for file I/O, and does not perform any network operations or data exfiltration. No anomalous or malicious patterns are detected. All imported modules are common, and the logic is straightforward with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard extension of Flask's Blueprint for serving static files and resources, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly deals with file serving and configuration handling, which are implemented securely. Overall, the code is safe based on the provided snippet.",
