{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Blueprint class for a Flask-like web application framework, providing methods for static file serving, resource opening, and configuration management.",
  "sources": "Configuration value retrieval from current_app.config, import statements, class and method definitions, and usage of parameters and attributes within the class.",
  "sinks": "Methods that interact with the filesystem (open), and the send_from_directory function which serves static files; no direct external untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration values influence the behavior of send_static_file and get_send_file_max_age; file paths are constructed from parameters and attributes, passed to open and send_from_directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. Use of standard library and known frameworks without suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Blueprint class with methods for handling static files and resources in a web application. It retrieves configuration values securely from the application config, constructs file paths carefully, and raises exceptions on invalid parameters. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network misuse. All operations relate to filesystem access and static content serving, typical for web frameworks. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate component of a web framework for managing blueprints, static files, and resources. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscated constructs, or security vulnerabilities. The code's functionality is standard and intended for web application development.",
