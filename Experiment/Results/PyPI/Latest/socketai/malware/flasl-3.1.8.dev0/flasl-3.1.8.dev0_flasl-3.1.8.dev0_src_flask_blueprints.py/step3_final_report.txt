{
  "purpose": "Defines a Flask-like Blueprint class for static file serving and resource management, including cache control and resource opening.",
  "sources": "Configuration values (e.g., SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT), method parameters (filename, resource), class attributes (static_folder, root_path).",
  "sinks": "Filesystem operations (open, send_from_directory), configuration influence on cache headers.",
  "flows": "Configuration affects cache duration; filename/resource parameters flow into filesystem functions for file access.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation; potential unvalidated filename/resource paths could be misused externally but are standard in static file serving.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard extension of Flask's Blueprint, handling static files and resources with typical filesystem operations. No malicious patterns, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The only potential concern is unvalidated input paths, which is common in such modules and should be externally validated. The code's structure and behavior are benign and align with typical web framework components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of static file and resource handling in a Flask-like framework. No malicious or obfuscated behavior detected. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects typical potential misuse if external validation is absent but does not indicate active vulnerabilities.",
