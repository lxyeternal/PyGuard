  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as a Flask Blueprint extension; no untrusted sources detected.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data sinks that could lead to malicious activity; configuration influences behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The risk score of 0.1 seems appropriate given the filesystem access, which is typical for static file serving.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a Flask Blueprint extension; no external untrusted input sources detected.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses filesystem functions and configuration; no suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is benign and standard. The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, considering filesystem access based on external parameters.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; standard static file serving.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Filesystem access via open() and send_from_directory; no untrusted data manipulation beyond typical use.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, with a risk score of 0.2 fitting the context.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous; no untrusted sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Filesystem functions and configuration influence.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard functionality; risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; no external untrusted sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Filesystem access, configuration-driven.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior. The code performs filesystem access and static content serving, which are common in web frameworks. No malware or malicious payloads are detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard Python constructs. No obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the filesystem access based on external parameters, a very low risk score (around 0.1–0.2) is justified. No high-risk behaviors are evident.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the current analysis.\n\n**Overall, I estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate component of a web framework with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
