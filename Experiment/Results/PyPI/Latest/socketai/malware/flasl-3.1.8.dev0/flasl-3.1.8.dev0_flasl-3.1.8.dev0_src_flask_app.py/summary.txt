  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious payload that automatically downloads and executes a remote executable during module import, representing a severe security threat. The malicious snippet is clearly identifiable and warrants maximum malware and risk scores. The initial reports that failed to recognize this activity should be updated to reflect a malware score of 1.0 and a security risk of 1.0. The obfuscation score is justified as 1 due to the use of base64 encoding. Overall, the code demonstrates a supply chain attack vector with high severity."
