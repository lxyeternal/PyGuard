  "purpose": "This code provides CLI utilities for managing and running Flask applications, including commands to run a development server, start an interactive shell, and display app routes. It also handles loading environment variables and locating Flask apps in modules.",
  "sources": "User inputs via CLI options (e.g., --app, --cert, --env-file), environment variables, and module attributes (e.g., find_best_app, locate_app). It reads configuration files (.env, .flaskenv) and inspects modules for Flask instances or factory functions.",
  "sinks": "Loading modules and executing factory functions (locate_app, find_app_by_string), file path handling (prepare_import, CertParamType), environment variable setting (load_dotenv), and starting the server (run_simple). These are typical sources for executing code based on external input, but no malicious sinks like network communication or file tampering are evident.",
  "flows": "CLI options -> load environment variables and locate app -> invoke factory functions or access module attributes -> start server or shell -> display routes. User-provided strings for module paths or factory functions are parsed, evaluated, and then executed, but the code uses safe AST parsing and literal_eval, minimizing risk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The only dynamic code execution involves calling user-specified factory functions or importing modules. The import_string function is used to import SSL contexts or cryptography libraries conditionally. The code properly handles ImportError exceptions and restricts certain behaviors based on the environment. No obfuscation or malware-like behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements CLI commands for Flask app management, carefully handling user input via command options and environment variables. It uses standard practices for importing modules, parsing paths, and loading environment files. The use of 'ast.literal_eval' for parsing factory arguments is safe, and there is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. All external interactions are limited to file and environment variable handling, and starting servers or shells. No suspicious network connections or data leaks are present. The code follows typical patterns for Flask CLI tooling with no signs of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Flask CLI utility script with secure handling of user input, environment loading, and application discovery. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware signatures. It is safe for use in supply chain contexts, assuming the environment and module sources are trusted.",
