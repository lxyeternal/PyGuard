  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Flask CLI utility designed for application management, with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The use of eval for startup scripts warrants caution but is a common pattern. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
