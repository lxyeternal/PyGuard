  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward import module, typical for a framework like Flask. It notes the absence of data flow from untrusted sources, no suspicious code, and no malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. These seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes this as a standard interface module with no malicious behavior. It emphasizes the lack of data flow or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. No concerns here.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more detailed, noting potential sinks like response functions, but clarifies that no untrusted data is processed here. No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The risk score remains low, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Well justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that this is an import/re-export module with no malicious activity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Solid reasoning.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, confirms the benign nature, no data flow from untrusted sources, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The confidence is slightly below 1 but still high; this is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk Score:** Given that this is a static import module with no runtime data handling, the low risk scores (0.1 or 0) are appropriate. The slightly non-zero risk scores in some reports are acceptable but could be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — Static import modules generally pose minimal security risk unless involved in data handling or dynamic code execution.\n\n**Note:** The only potential reason to assign a non-zero risk score would be if the module were involved in dynamic code execution, data handling, or contained hidden backdoors, none of which are evident here.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n**Malware score: 0**  \n**Obfuscated score: 0**  \n**Risk score: 0**  \n\nThis reflects the true security posture of the code: a standard, safe framework import module.",
