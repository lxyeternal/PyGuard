{
  "purpose": "Provides Flask utility functions for response handling, URL generation, environment variable configuration, file sending, flashing messages, and request context management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., FLASK_DEBUG, FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV), request context, session data, request environment, imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Response objects, environment variables, session storage, file paths, URL generation functions, message flashing signals.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence configuration flags; session data stores flashed messages; request context manages streaming; response objects are created and modified; signals are emitted for message flashing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution; standard use of environment variables and Flask APIs; no unusual data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of standard Flask helper functions, employing best practices for environment configuration, response creation, file serving, URL building, and message flashing. It uses secure methods for file handling and environment variable management, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The data flows are typical for web applications, and no vulnerabilities or backdoors are evident. The scores for malware (0), obfuscation (0), and low security risk (0.2) are consistent with the code's benign and utility nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Flask utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security flaws. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
