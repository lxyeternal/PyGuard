  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on data flows, potential vulnerabilities, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard Flask utilities; environment variables (FLASK_DEBUG, FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV); session data; request context.\n- **Sinks:** Response creation, environment variables, session, signals.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious data flow; environment variables are standard config points; no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** None detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Low (0.2). The only concern could be environment variable manipulation, but this is standard.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical Flask utility module with no malicious behavior. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions; environment variables for debug/dotenv; request environment; session data.\n- **Sinks:** Response objects, file paths, URL generation.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** File serving functions could be risky if paths are not validated, but they use Werkzeug's secure methods.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** No signs.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher (0.2), but still low.\n\n**Conclusion:** Standard Flask helpers, no malicious intent. Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Response creation, URL, and flash messaging; environment variables; request data.\n- **Sinks:** Response objects, session, files.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** File serving functions depend on user input but use Werkzeug's secure functions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** None.\n- **Security Risk:** Low (0.2).\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; safe, standard code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions; environment variables; request/session data.\n- **Sinks:** Responses, URL generation, file serving.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Uses secure methods; no suspicious data flow.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** None.\n- **Security Risk:** Low (0.2).\n\n**Conclusion:** Typical Flask utilities, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard Flask helpers; environment variables; request/session.\n- **Sinks:** Responses, file sending, URL building.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Uses Werkzeug's secure functions; no suspicious data flow.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** None.\n- **Security Risk:** Low (0.2).\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports are 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious code or behaviors are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting minimal configuration or environment variable manipulation risks typical in web apps.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — standard configuration and environment handling, no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard Flask utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
