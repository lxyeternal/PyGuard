  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for a Flask web application, including response creation, URL generation, request streaming, flashing messages, and file handling.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (get_debug_flag, get_load_dotenv), session data (flash, get_flashed_messages), request context (_cv_request), request environment (send_file, send_from_directory), and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Response creation (make_response, redirect, send_file, send_from_directory), environment variables (os.environ), session data (session), request environment (request.environ), Flask app methods (current_app.*), and message signals (message_flashed).",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> get_debug_flag/get_load_dotenv; session data -> flash/get_flashed_messages; request context -> stream_with_context; request environment -> send_file/send_from_directory; response objects -> make_response, redirect; Flask app methods -> url_for, send_file, send_from_directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. Usage of environment variables is standard, but get_debug_flag and get_load_dotenv rely on environment config, which could be manipulated if environment is compromised, though typical. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed. The code relies heavily on Flask and Werkzeug functions, which are standard and safe in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility functions for Flask apps, using environment variables, session, and request contexts, and Flask/Werkzeug functions. All data sources are standard for web applications. Data sinks involve response creation, environment variable access, session management, and message signals. No suspicious data flow or input handling vulnerabilities are apparent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are detected. The functions mainly act as wrappers or utility helpers, with no evidence of malicious intent. No obfuscated code or code injection mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Flask utility module implementing standard web application features without any malicious behaviors or security risks. It follows standard patterns for environment variable access, session and request management, and response handling. No malicious or sabotage code is evident.",
