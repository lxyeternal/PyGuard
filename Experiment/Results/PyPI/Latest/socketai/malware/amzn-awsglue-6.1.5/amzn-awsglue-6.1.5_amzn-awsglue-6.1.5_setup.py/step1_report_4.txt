{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to define a Python package setup process that includes a custom post-installation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package's README.md file for long description, and makes an HTTP GET request to a remote server at http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-awsglue.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP request sends data to the remote server; the code does not process untrusted input but actively communicates with an external server during installation.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the custom install command triggers a request to the specified external URL, potentially revealing system details or other data to that server.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an external network call during the installation process without any apparent legitimate purpose, which is unusual for standard package setup scripts. The request URL is a suspicious non-standard domain, and the code repeats the same request twice, once at the top-level and once in the post-install hook. No other security or validation mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and third-party requests library. It makes an external GET request to a non-standard domain immediately upon import, which could be used for tracking or malicious activity. The post-install hook also makes the same request, indicating potential attempts to communicate with a command and control server or exfiltrate data during installation. The setup configuration overrides the default install command to include this network activity. There are no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The repeated request to the same URL is suspicious, especially in a package meant for distribution. Overall, the behavior suggests malicious intent or at least malicious-like activity designed to contact an external server during installation, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by performing external network communication during package installation, likely for tracking, data exfiltration, or command and control purposes. The URL and repeated request further raise suspicion. This package should be considered malicious or compromised.",
