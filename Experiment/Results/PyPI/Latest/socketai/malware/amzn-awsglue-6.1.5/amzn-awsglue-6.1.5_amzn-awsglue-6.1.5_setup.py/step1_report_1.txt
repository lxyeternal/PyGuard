{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation command that makes an HTTP request during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for long description, and makes an HTTP GET request to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-awsglue'.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP request is sent to an external server, potentially leaking information or providing a command-and-control channel.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the custom PostInstallCommand executes, triggering the requests.get call to the external server, which could send or receive data.",
  "anomalies": "The code makes an external HTTP request during installation without clear legitimate purpose. The URL 'pov.sh:45111' appears suspicious and may be malicious. The request is made twice: once at the top-level and once inside the post_install function. No validation or handling of the response is performed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'amzn-awsglue'. It includes a custom installation command that, upon execution, makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external server. This request occurs both immediately during module load and during the post-install phase, which is unusual and potentially malicious. Such behavior can be used to contact a command-and-control server, exfiltrate environment details, or perform malicious actions. No user input is involved, but the external call is suspicious and unnecessary for typical package setup procedures. No other malicious or obfuscated code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior by making external network requests during installation to a potentially malicious server, which could be used for malicious purposes such as command-and-control or data exfiltration. This is a security risk and indicates possible malicious intent.",
