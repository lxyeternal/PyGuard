{
  "purpose": "The code performs external HTTP GET requests to a suspicious URL during module load and package installation, likely for malicious command-and-control or data exfiltration purposes.",
  "sources": "Immediate execution of requests at module load; requests within the post_install() function invoked during installation.",
  "sinks": "External network communication to http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-awsglue, which could lead to data exfiltration, command-and-control, or tracking.",
  "flows": "Code loads, triggers immediate request; during install, post_install() makes the same request; no validation or response handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated network requests during import and install; contact with a suspicious, non-standard URL; no legitimate purpose or user consent; lack of response validation.",
  "analysis": "The code makes two explicit external GET requests to a suspicious URL during both module load and package installation, which is highly unusual and indicative of malicious intent. The URL is non-standard and potentially malicious. The requests are made without validation, and their purpose is unclear, suggesting possible command-and-control, data exfiltration, or tracking activities. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the behavior pattern is suspicious. The high malware score (~0.9) and risk score (~0.9) are justified given the potential for malicious activity. The repeated contact with an obscure server during setup is a red flag in supply chain security. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious or compromised packages, warranting strong caution.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code demonstrates highly suspicious behavior—making external requests to a suspicious server during import and installation—indicating likely malicious intent. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. It should be treated as malicious or compromised until further investigation confirms benign use.",
