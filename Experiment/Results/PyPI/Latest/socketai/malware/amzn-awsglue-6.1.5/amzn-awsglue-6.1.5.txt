The high malware and security risk scores are justified. It should be treated as malicious or compromised until further investigation confirms benign use."

      "conclusion": "The code is minimal but contacts a suspicious external server, raising concern for potential malicious activity. The URL's non-standard domain and port justify high suspicion, but without additional context or payload evidence, the malicious intent cannot be confirmed. The scores reflect this cautious stance, with a malware score around 0.6 and a security risk of approximately 0.7. Further investigation, such as domain reputation checks or network traffic analysis, is recommended."
