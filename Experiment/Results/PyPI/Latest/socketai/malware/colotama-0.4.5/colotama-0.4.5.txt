      "conclusion": "The code's behavior of executing an external file during installation without validation is a significant security concern and could be malicious if the 'colotama' file is compromised. This pattern is commonly associated with supply chain attacks or backdoors. The scores should reflect high malware and security risk levels, given the potential for arbitrary code execution."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main concern is the immediate execution of cli() on import, which could be risky if cli() performs harmful actions. Overall, the code appears benign, with a low security risk primarily due to its pattern of execution."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from error logging practices, which are common but should be handled carefully in production environments. Overall, the reports accurately assess the code's safety, and no adjustments are necessary."
