  "purpose": "Attempt to import and instantiate an EmojiConverter object from the pyprettifier package, and handle import errors by logging them to a temporary file.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'pyprettifier' and the import error exception handling block.",
  "sinks": "Writing to '/tmp/a' in case of ImportError.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import 'pyprettifier' -> if import fails, write error message to '/tmp/a'.",
  "anomalies": "The code writes error messages to a file in /tmp, which is not inherently malicious but may be used to log issues. No other unusual behavior is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script tries to import a third-party module 'pyprettifier'. If the import fails, it logs the ImportError message to a file '/tmp/a'. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious activity. The code is straightforward, with minimal logic and no suspicious network activity or obfuscated code. The logging to '/tmp/a' could be considered an unusual practice but is not malicious in itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import attempt and logs errors to a temporary file if the import fails. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this code fragment. It appears benign, primarily intended for environment setup or troubleshooting.",
