  "purpose": "Attempt to import 'pyprettifier' and instantiate 'EmojiConverter'; log import errors to '/tmp/a' if import fails.",
  "sources": "The import statement for 'pyprettifier'; the exception message captured during ImportError.",
  "sinks": "Writing the exception message to the file '/tmp/a' upon import failure.",
  "flows": "Import attempt -> exception handling -> writing error message to '/tmp/a'.",
  "anomalies": "Logging exception messages directly to a temporary file without sanitization; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing a simple import and error logging. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. The only unusual aspect is error logging to a temp file, which could leak info but is not malicious. The code's clarity and purpose are transparent, and the error handling is standard. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from error logging practices, which are common but should be handled carefully in production environments. Overall, the reports accurately assess the code's safety, and no adjustments are necessary.",
