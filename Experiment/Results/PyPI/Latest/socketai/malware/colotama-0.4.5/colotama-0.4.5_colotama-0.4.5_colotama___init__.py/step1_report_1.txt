  "flows": "Import of 'cli' -> execution of 'cli()' function call.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate execution of 'cli()' upon import without any apparent input validation or safeguards; no indication of malicious behavior but potential for arbitrary code execution if 'cli' is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'cli' function from the local package and executes it immediately. There are no other operations, data handling, or input sources within this file. The execution of 'cli()' could trigger any code defined within that function. Since the code is minimal and only runs an imported function, the risk depends entirely on what 'cli()' does. However, within this file, no malicious behavior is evident. The pattern is common for CLI entry points. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward CLI entry point, executing the imported 'cli()' function. There are no explicit malicious indicators within this snippet, but the security posture depends on the implementation of 'cli()'. Given only this code, it does not show malicious intent.",
