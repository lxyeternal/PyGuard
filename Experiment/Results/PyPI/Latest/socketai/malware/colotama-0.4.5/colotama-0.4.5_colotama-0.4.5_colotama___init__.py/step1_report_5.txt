{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a Python package by importing and executing a command-line interface (CLI) function.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.cli' module; execution of 'cli()' function",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'cli()' which could potentially run untrusted code depending on its implementation",
  "flows": "Import of 'cli' -> execution of 'cli()' function",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed; straightforward package initialization",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'cli' function from a local module '.cli' and immediately executes it. The simplicity suggests this is a command-line entry point. Without inspecting the implementation of 'cli', we cannot determine if it performs malicious actions. The code itself contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious logic. It performs a common pattern of invoking a CLI command on package load.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script that runs a CLI function. There is no evidence of malicious behavior within this fragment alone, but the security of the 'cli()' function depends on its implementation. No malicious intent or suspicious activity is evident from this code snippet.",
