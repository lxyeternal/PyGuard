  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main concern is the immediate execution of cli() on import, which could be risky if cli() performs harmful actions. Overall, the code appears benign, with a low security risk primarily due to its pattern of execution."
