{
  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing and executing a command-line interface function",
  "sources": "Import statement for '.cli' module and the invocation of 'cli()' function",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'cli()' which could process input data from command line arguments or environment",
  "flows": "Import of '.cli' -> call to 'cli()' function, which may process inputs and perform actions",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious or unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'cli' function from the local 'cli' module and immediately executes it. This is a typical pattern for command-line tools to run their main interface. No external data sources, environment variables, or network calls are evident. The code itself is minimal, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior. Without insight into the 'cli()' implementation, it's impossible to determine if malicious behavior exists, but the snippet itself appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as an entry point to a CLI application, executing the 'cli()' function upon import. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks in this snippet alone.",
