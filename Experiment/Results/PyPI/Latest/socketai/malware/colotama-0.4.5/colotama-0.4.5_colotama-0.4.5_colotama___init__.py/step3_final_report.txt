  "purpose": "Initialize package and execute command-line interface via cli() function.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .cli module; execution of cli() upon import.",
  "sinks": "Execution of cli() function which may perform actions based on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Import -> cli() execution",
  "anomalies": "Immediate execution of cli() during import, which can cause side effects; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a cli() function and executes it immediately, a common pattern for CLI tools. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The security concern depends on what cli() does; if it runs commands, reads sensitive data, or performs network activity, risks could exist. The malware score is 0 due to lack of malicious indicators; the risk score is modest (around 0.2) due to the pattern of executing code at import time. Confidence is high (0.8) that the code itself is benign, but the potential impact depends on cli()'s implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main concern is the immediate execution of cli() on import, which could be risky if cli() performs harmful actions. Overall, the code appears benign, with a low security risk primarily due to its pattern of execution.",
