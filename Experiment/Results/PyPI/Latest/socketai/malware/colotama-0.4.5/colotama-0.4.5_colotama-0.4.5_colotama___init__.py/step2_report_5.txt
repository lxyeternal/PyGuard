  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a minimal `__init__.py` that imports a `cli` function and executes it immediately.\n- The core concern is that executing `cli()` upon import can trigger arbitrary code execution, depending on what `cli()` does.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns is present in the code snippet itself.\n- The security risk is primarily tied to the behavior of `cli()`, which is not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- The code is straightforward and matches the descriptions.\n- No issues are present in the code itself: no obfuscation, no suspicious constructs.\n- The main concern is the potential for `cli()` to execute malicious code, but this cannot be confirmed from this snippet alone.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:\n- All reports correctly identify that the immediate execution of `cli()` upon import is unconventional and could be risky.\n- They also correctly note that the actual maliciousness depends on `cli()`'s implementation.\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the lack of information about `cli()`.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is reasonable given the code snippet.\n- Security risk scores are generally low (0.1 to 0.3), which aligns with the potential risk of executing `cli()` automatically.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.6 to 0.9), reflecting the clarity of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk and malware scores:\n- Since the code executes an imported function immediately, and `cli()` could potentially run arbitrary commands, the risk is non-zero but cannot be definitively high without inspecting `cli()`.\n- Malware score remains at 0 across reports, which is appropriate unless evidence suggests malicious behavior.\n\n### Consistency:\n- Scores are consistent with the analysis: minimal code, standard pattern, no suspicious constructs, but potential risk due to immediate execution.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code in the snippet)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (small risk due to immediate execution, but no concrete evidence)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code pattern is common for CLI entry points.\n- The actual security concern hinges on `cli()`'s implementation, which is unknown.\n- The immediate execution is potentially risky but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard CLI entry point.\n- No malicious indicators are present in this snippet.\n- The risk is primarily due to the pattern of executing `cli()` on import, which could be exploited if `cli()` is malicious.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese reflect a cautious stance given the pattern but acknowledge the lack of concrete malicious evidence.",
