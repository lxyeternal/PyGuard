  "purpose": "Initialize the package and execute the CLI command when imported",
  "sources": "Import statement for .cli module, execution of cli() function",
  "sinks": "Execution of cli() function which may run external commands or user input",
  "flows": "Import -> cli() execution (potentially running user input or external commands)",
  "anomalies": "The direct call to cli() upon import could lead to unintended command execution during import, which is unusual but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports the cli function from the .cli module and immediately executes it. This pattern can be risky because importing this module triggers execution of cli(), potentially causing side effects like running commands, prompting user input, or other actions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present. The behavior suggests automatic CLI invocation, which could be used maliciously if cli() is designed to execute arbitrary commands, but cannot confirm malicious intent without inspecting the cli() implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code automatically runs the CLI interface on import, which may be unconventional and potentially risky, but there is no explicit malicious behavior evident from this snippet alone. The main concern is the side effect of immediate execution.",
