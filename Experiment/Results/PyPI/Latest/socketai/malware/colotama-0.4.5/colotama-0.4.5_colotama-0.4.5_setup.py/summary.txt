  "conclusion": "The code's behavior of executing an external file during installation without validation is a significant security concern and could be malicious if the 'colotama' file is compromised. This pattern is commonly associated with supply chain attacks or backdoors. The scores should reflect high malware and security risk levels, given the potential for arbitrary code execution."
