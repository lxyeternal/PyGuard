{
  "purpose": "The code executes an external file named 'colotama' located in the installation directory during post-installation, without validation or checks.",
  "sources": "The path to 'colotama' constructed using sys.executable and the installation directory, used in call() with shell=True.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'colotama' file via subprocess.call, which can run arbitrary code if the file is malicious.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a command string combining sys.executable and the 'colotama' path, then executes it via call() with shell=True during post-install.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of an external file during setup without validation, using shell=True with string interpolation, which is insecure.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that, after installation, runs a function '_post_install' which constructs a command to execute 'colotama' using the current Python interpreter. The command is executed via subprocess.call with shell=True, which is risky. The 'colotama' file's contents are unknown, and executing it without validation poses a security risk. The pattern of executing external code during install is suspicious and can be exploited for malicious purposes. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but the behavior is potentially dangerous if the external file is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code's behavior of executing an external file during installation without validation is a significant security concern and could be malicious if the 'colotama' file is compromised. This pattern is commonly associated with supply chain attacks or backdoors. The scores should reflect high malware and security risk levels, given the potential for arbitrary code execution.",
