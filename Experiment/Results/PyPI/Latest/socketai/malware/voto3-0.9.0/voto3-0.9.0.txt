      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration of system information during installation, which is privacy-invasive and suspicious. While it does not contain traditional malware payloads, its behavior warrants a high security concern. The malware score should be set around 0.8, reflecting the malicious-like privacy invasion, with a risk score similarly high. The code should be flagged for review or removal due to its covert exfiltration behavior."
