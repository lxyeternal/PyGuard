{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'voto3' with a custom post-installation step.",
  "sources": "The data is gathered from the 'platform' module for system info and 'requests' to fetch external IP address.",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL with system info and IP is used in an HTTP GET request to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "After installation, the 'send()' function is called, which retrieves system info and IP, constructs a URL, and makes a GET request to it.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an external network request during installation to an external webhook with potentially sensitive info (hostname, system name, IP). The URL includes system data and IP address in a GET parameter, which could be used for tracking or data exfiltration. The use of 'platform' as an install requirement is unnecessary, but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration with an overridden install command. The custom 'send()' function executes during installation, which collects system hostname and OS info via 'platform', and retrieves the external IP address using 'requests.get'. It then constructs a URL embedding this data and sends a GET request to an external webhook URL. This behavior can be used for tracking or malicious data collection, especially if the user is unaware of it. The request to 'https://webhook.site' is suspicious since it could be used for data exfiltration or user tracking. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious code per se, but the data exfiltration behavior during installation is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a seemingly benign package setup but includes a hidden, potentially malicious post-installation action that collects and transmits system information to an external server. This behavior could be used for tracking or malicious data collection without user consent, constituting a security risk.",
