  "purpose": "To perform package setup and execute a post-installation step that reports system information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), platform.system(), requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').text",
  "sinks": "requests.get(url) which sends data to a webhook URL",
  "flows": "Collect system hostname, OS type, and external IP, then send this data to a remote webhook URL during installation",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a function that sends system data to an external URL without any user consent or notification, which is unusual for standard setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and requests, defines a function 'send' that gathers system hostname, OS type, and external IP, then constructs a URL to a webhook and makes a GET request to it. This function is called during the custom 'install' command's run method, making this data transmission occur automatically upon package installation. The data transmission occurs without user consent or transparency, which is suspicious. The code's primary malicious activity is the exfiltration of system details to an external server during installation. There are no hardcoded credentials or other malicious payloads, but the behavior itself is intrusive and potentially malicious. The package setup itself appears standard but includes hidden data exfiltration behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data exfiltration by sending system information to an external URL during installation, indicating potentially malicious behavior. This activity is hidden within the setup process and lacks user awareness or consent.",
