{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process with a custom post-installation action that sends system information to a webhook.",
  "sources": "The 'send()' function reads system information using 'platform' and makes HTTP requests via 'requests' to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.get' call in 'send()' sends collected system info to an external webhook URL, potentially leaking sensitive data.",
  "flows": "After installation, the 'send()' function executes, gathering system hostname, OS name, and public IP, then transmits this data to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The 'send()' function is invoked automatically after package installation, which is unusual behavior for typical setup scripts. The URL includes a webhook that can receive data without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a 'send()' function that collects system hostname, OS type, and public IP address, then sends this information to a specified external URL. A custom install command runs this function post-installation, effectively exfiltrating system data without explicit user approval. The setup configuration includes standard package metadata and dependencies, but the core concern lies in the automatic data transmission during install, which could be malicious or privacy-invasive. No hardcoded credentials are present, but the data exfiltration behavior is suspicious, especially in a setup context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an automated system info exfiltration to an external webhook during package installation, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. This is highly suspicious, as normal setup procedures do not send data externally. The package's primary purpose appears legitimate on the surface, but the post-install action raises security concerns.",
