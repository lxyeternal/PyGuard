{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration with a custom post-installation step that executes a function to send system information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), system type (platform.system()), and external IP address (via requests to api.ipify.org).",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL, which includes system information, is used in a requests.get() call to send data to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System information is gathered and concatenated into a URL, which is then used as the target for a GET request, transmitting data externally.",
  "anomalies": "The send() function is invoked during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. It exfiltrates system details without user consent. The URL used for data exfiltration is hardcoded to a webhook site, and the request is made without any user prompt or logging.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata and a custom install command that overrides the run method to execute a send() function post-installation. The send() function gathers system information, including hostname, OS type, and external IP address, and then sends this data to a predefined external webhook URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration typical of malicious activity, especially since it occurs automatically during installation without user awareness. The inclusion of requests for external IP and system data indicates potential privacy violations or malicious tracking. There are no other suspicious or malicious code patterns, but the hidden data exfiltration behavior is significant.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly exfiltrating system information during package installation. This action is hidden within the post-install process and communicates with an external webhook. The package could be used for tracking or malicious data collection without user consent. Therefore, it poses a security risk.",
