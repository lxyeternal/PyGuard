{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'voto3' Python package, including a custom post-installation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via platform.node() and platform.system(), and retrieves the external IP address using requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').",
  "sinks": "The collected data is sent via a GET request to a webhook URL, potentially exposing system identifiers and IP address.",
  "flows": "Data from platform and requests.get is concatenated into a URL, which is then used in requests.get() to send data to the webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes collecting system info and external IP during installation and immediately sending it over the network to a webhook URL, which is suspicious and may be used for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'send()' that gathers system hostname, OS, and external IP address, then constructs a URL containing this data. During the post-installation phase, this function is invoked, causing the system's identity and IP to be transmitted to an external webhook. The use of 'platform' as an install requirement is unnecessary (since it's part of the standard library) but not malicious. The code does not perform harmful actions like file modification, privilege escalation, or malicious data exfiltration beyond information gathering. However, the behavior of collecting and transmitting system info without user consent is suspicious and could be used for tracking or malicious monitoring. No obfuscation is present, and the code appears straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious post-install behavior where system information is collected and sent to an external webhook. While not outright malicious malware, this behavior is suspicious, as it may compromise user privacy or be used for unauthorized tracking.",
