{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform a post-installation step during package setup, specifically exfiltrating system information to an external webhook URL.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), platform.system(), requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call sending data to the hardcoded webhook URL",
  "flows": "Data collected from platform and requests modules flows from the send() function to the external URL via a GET request during installation",
  "anomalies": "Automatic data exfiltration during setup without user consent, data sent to a hardcoded external webhook, no obfuscation, no user notification",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script with a custom install command that invokes send(), which collects system hostname, OS, and external IP, then sends this data via a GET request to a specified webhook URL. This behavior occurs during package installation without user awareness, indicating potential privacy invasion or malicious tracking. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports vary, but higher scores (around 0.8-0.9) are justified given the covert collection and transmission of system info. The behavior aligns with privacy-invasive or malicious tracking activities rather than traditional malware, but it is highly suspicious and potentially harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration of system information during installation, which is privacy-invasive and suspicious. While it does not contain traditional malware payloads, its behavior warrants a high security concern. The malware score should be set around 0.8, reflecting the malicious-like privacy invasion, with a risk score similarly high. The code should be flagged for review or removal due to its covert exfiltration behavior.",
