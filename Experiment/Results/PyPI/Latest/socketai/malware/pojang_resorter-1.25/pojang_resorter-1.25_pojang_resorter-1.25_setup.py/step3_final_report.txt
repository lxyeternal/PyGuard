{
  "purpose": "This code executes an external executable ('your_executable.exe') located within the package directory during installation, unconditionally, without validation or user consent.",
  "sources": "The path to the executable is constructed using 'self.install_lib' and the subpath 'pojang_resorter/your_executable.exe'. The code checks for its existence with os.path.exists() before executing.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run([exe_path], check=True) executes the external executable, which could lead to system compromise if the executable is malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "The code constructs the executable path, verifies its existence, and then runs it directly, creating a source-to-sink flow from the existence check to execution without validation.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of an external file during setup without validation, signature verification, or user prompt; straightforward code with no obfuscation; no hidden or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, during package installation, unconditionally runs an external executable if found. This pattern is highly suspicious because it executes external code without validation or user awareness, creating a significant security risk. The code is clear and straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. The main concern is the potential for supply chain attacks, malware deployment, or system compromise through malicious or tampered executables. The behavior aligns with known malicious tactics, justifying high malware and security risk scores. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75-0.8, security risk ~0.75-0.85) are appropriate and consistent with the behavior. The overall conclusion is that this pattern is dangerous and should be avoided or modified to include validation, user prompts, or signatures to mitigate risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk behavior by executing an external executable during installation without validation, posing a significant security threat. The pattern is indicative of malicious activity or supply chain attack vectors. The assigned scores are justified, and the behavior warrants caution and remediation.",
