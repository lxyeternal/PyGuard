{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pojang_resorter' Python package, including a custom installation step that executes an external executable after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to check for the existence of an executable at a specified path.",
  "sinks": "The code runs an external executable ('your_executable.exe') during installation.",
  "flows": "The script checks if the executable exists, then executes it if found, during the custom install process.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically runs an executable post-install without user consent, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The executable path is hardcoded relative to the install directory, and there is no validation or signature check of the executable. The executable could perform malicious actions upon being run.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation command that extends the standard 'install' process. After the normal installation steps, it constructs a path to an executable file within the installed package directory. If the executable exists, it runs it immediately using subprocess.run(). This behavior is suspicious because executing an external program automatically during package installation can be used to deploy malicious payloads or malware. No checks for the integrity, authenticity, or purpose of the executable are present. The executable's name ('your_executable.exe') is generic, but its automatic execution raises security concerns. This pattern could be exploited to embed malicious code that runs without user awareness or consent. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or other suspicious techniques are evident outside this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains malicious potential because it automatically runs an external executable during installation without user interaction or validation. This behavior is typical of supply chain attacks or malware deployment tactics. Overall, the code demonstrates a significant security risk.",
