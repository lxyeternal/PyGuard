  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process that installs a package and runs a specified executable after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, executable path, and uses subprocess to execute a file.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run([exe_path], check=True) potentially executes an external executable file.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code checks for the existence of 'your_executable.exe' in the installation directory and executes it.",
  "anomalies": "The code runs an external executable immediately after installation without any validation, which could be suspicious. No code appears obfuscated, but the behavior of executing an external file post-installation is unusual and potentially malicious if the executable is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup-related modules and defines a custom install command that extends setuptools' install. During run(), it executes the standard install process, then constructs a path to 'your_executable.exe' within the installed package directory. If the executable exists, it runs it using subprocess.run. This behavior is potentially malicious because it automatically executes an external program during installation without user consent or validation. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The overall pattern resembles a supply chain attack vector, as malicious executables could be embedded and executed automatically, which is suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard package setup but includes a potentially malicious pattern of executing an external executable immediately after installation, which could be used for malicious purposes. This behavior warrants suspicion and further review of the executable being run.",
