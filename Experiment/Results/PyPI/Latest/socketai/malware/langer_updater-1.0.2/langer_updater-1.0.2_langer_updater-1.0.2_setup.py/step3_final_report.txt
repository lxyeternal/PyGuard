{
  "purpose": "The code loads and executes 'my.zip' during setup via zipimport, then calls 'my.hello()' from the loaded module.",
  "sources": "Reading 'my.zip' via zipimport and executing 'my.hello()' in the test() function during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'my.hello()' which runs code from the external zip archive.",
  "flows": "zipimport.zipimporter loads 'my.zip' -> exec_module executes code within 'my.zip' -> 'my.hello()' is called, executing code from the archive.",
  "anomalies": "Code executes external archive during setup without validation, signature check, or sandboxing; no validation or checksum verification of 'my.zip'.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads and executes code from 'my.zip' during installation without any validation, creating a high security risk. This pattern allows arbitrary code execution, which can be exploited if 'my.zip' is malicious. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The pattern is inherently dangerous, especially in supply chain contexts. The current malware scores in the reports underestimate this risk; given the behavior, the malware suspicion should be high. The risk of executing untrusted code during setup warrants a high security risk score. The absence of validation or signature verification further exacerbates the threat.",
  "conclusion": "The pattern of executing unverified external code during package installation poses a significant security threat, enabling potential malicious payloads and supply chain attacks. The malware score should be increased to reflect this high risk, and the overall security risk should be rated very high.",
