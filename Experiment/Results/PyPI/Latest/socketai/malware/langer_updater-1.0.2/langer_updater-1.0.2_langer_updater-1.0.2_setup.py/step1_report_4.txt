{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that installs resources and executes a custom function during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from 'README.md' and imports modules; executes 'test()' during installation, which loads a zip archive 'my.zip' and runs its 'hello()' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'test()' function loads and executes code from 'my.zip' without validation, potentially allowing malicious code execution if the zip contains harmful code.",
  "flows": "During installation, 'test()' loads 'my.zip' via zipimport, creates a module from it, executes its code, and calls 'hello()'. The resource files are included but not executed.",
  "anomalies": "Loading and executing code directly from an external zip archive ('my.zip') without validation or sandboxing is unusual and potentially dangerous. No code validation or signature checks are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'zipimport' to load and execute code from 'my.zip', then calls 'hello()' from that module. This dynamic code execution from an external archive is risky, especially without validation. The rest of the setup script appears standard with no obvious malicious or obfuscated code. The pattern of executing code from an external archive during install could be used for malicious purposes if the archive is malicious or tampered with. There are no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script dynamically loads and executes code from an external zip file during installation without validation, which could pose security risks if the zip is malicious. The overall code appears straightforward, but the external code execution point is a potential attack vector.",
