  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from two local modules: 'logax' and 'i'.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules 'logax' and 'i'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; potential for imported modules to contain sinks if they execute code on import.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows in the provided snippet; import statements may trigger code execution in modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure imported content, making it difficult to analyze the code's behavior. No other anomalies detected in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements with wildcard imports from local modules. This practice can be risky as it imports all names into the current namespace, which may lead to namespace pollution or hiding of malicious code within those modules. Without inspecting the content of 'logax' and 'i', it is impossible to determine if they contain malicious code or backdoors. The snippet itself does not contain malicious logic but relies on external modules that could potentially do so upon import. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident in this minimal code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic module imports with no explicit malicious behavior visible. The main concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can hide malicious code within the imported modules. To fully assess risk, the content of 'logax' and 'i' should be reviewed. Currently, the snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious intent.",
