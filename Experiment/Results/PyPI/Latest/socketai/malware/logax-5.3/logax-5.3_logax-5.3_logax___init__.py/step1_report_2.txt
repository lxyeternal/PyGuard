  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing all contents from local modules named 'logax' and 'i'.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules 'logax' and 'i'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if the imported modules contain malicious code, it could execute during import; no direct sinks in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports execute code during module load, potentially executing code from 'logax' and 'i'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure the actual functions and variables imported, which may hide malicious code or unintended behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is limited to two import statements from local modules with wildcard imports. Such imports can hide malicious behavior within the imported modules. Without inspecting the contents of 'logax' and 'i', it is impossible to determine if malicious code is present. The use of wildcard imports is suspicious because it can import hidden or malicious functions or variables. No other code or context is provided. The overall risk depends on the contents of the imported modules, which are not shown.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet itself is minimal and primarily involves imports. The main concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can conceal malicious code if the imported modules are malicious or compromised. Due to lack of visibility into the imported modules, the risk cannot be fully assessed, but the import pattern warrants caution.",
