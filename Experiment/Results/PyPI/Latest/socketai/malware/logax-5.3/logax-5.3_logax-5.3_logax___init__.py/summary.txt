  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation, but the use of wildcard imports warrants caution as it can conceal malicious code within the imported modules. Without inspecting 'logax' and 'i', the risk remains theoretical but should be acknowledged. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly zero; the security risk score should be kept low (~0.2-0.3). Best practice would be to replace wildcard imports with explicit imports for clarity and security."
