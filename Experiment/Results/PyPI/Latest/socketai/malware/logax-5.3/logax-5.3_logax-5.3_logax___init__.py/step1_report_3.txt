{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from local modules 'logax' and 'i', likely to include functions or classes used elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules 'logax' and 'i'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable accesses are present in the given snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this snippet; it only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "The use of wildcard imports ('*') can be considered bad practice as it obscures the source of imported symbols but is not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, which is common for modular Python projects. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The lack of any additional logic, external connections, or secret handling reduces concern. The use of wildcard imports could potentially introduce namespace pollution but does not suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet performs standard module imports without any malicious behavior. There are no security risks or malware indications based on this minimal content. The primary concern is adherence to best practices regarding imports, not security.",
