{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from two local modules, logax and i, presumably as part of a larger package or application.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing modules 'logax' and 'i' within the same package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows; imports do not execute untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow detected; import statements do not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure which symbols are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code, but by itself, it does not indicate malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements with wildcard imports from local modules. Such imports can obscure the actual imported functions or variables, which could hide malicious code or unintentional behavior. However, without inspecting the contents of 'logax' and 'i', the code here alone does not reveal malicious intent or security risks. The code structure is minimal and standard for package initialization, with no suspicious patterns, external data handling, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple module import with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on the provided code. The use of wildcard imports warrants caution as it can conceal imported symbols, but no malicious activity can be inferred without further context.",
