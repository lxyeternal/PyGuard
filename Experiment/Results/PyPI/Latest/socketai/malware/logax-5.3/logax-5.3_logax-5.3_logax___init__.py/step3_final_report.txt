  "purpose": "Minimal import statements from local modules 'logax' and 'i' using wildcard imports.",
  "sources": "The import statements themselves; no other code present.",
  "sinks": "Potentially within 'logax' and 'i' modules if they contain malicious code executed during import.",
  "flows": "Import statements may execute code in 'logax' and 'i' during module load, but no explicit data flows are visible.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports which can hide symbols and potentially conceal malicious code; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two wildcard import statements. No suspicious logic or obfuscation is present. The main concern is that the imported modules could contain malicious code or hidden behaviors, but this cannot be confirmed without inspecting those modules. The wildcard imports violate best practices by obscuring imported symbols, which could hide malicious code if the modules are compromised. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero; security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.3) due to import practices. Confidence is high that the code itself is benign, but the risk depends on the trustworthiness of the modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation, but the use of wildcard imports warrants caution as it can conceal malicious code within the imported modules. Without inspecting 'logax' and 'i', the risk remains theoretical but should be acknowledged. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly zero; the security risk score should be kept low (~0.2-0.3). Best practice would be to replace wildcard imports with explicit imports for clarity and security.",
