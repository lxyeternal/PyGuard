  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence, logic, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .logax import *` and `from .i import *`.\n- The main concern raised is the use of wildcard imports, which can obscure what symbols are imported and potentially hide malicious code.\n- No actual malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in the snippet itself.\n- The risk of malicious activity largely depends on the contents of the imported modules, which are not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Code Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code snippets are exactly as provided. They are simple import statements.\n- **Malicious behavior:** Not directly observable in the snippet.\n- **Potential issues:** Wildcard imports can lead to namespace pollution, accidental overwriting, or hiding malicious code within modules.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Score:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.2\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the code is benign but warns about wildcard imports hiding symbols.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable; no changes needed.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Score:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.3\n- **Analysis:** Slightly higher security risk score due to the possibility that imported modules could contain malicious code. Still, without evidence, this is speculative.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk score of 0.3 is acceptable but perhaps slightly high given no evidence of malicious code. I would suggest lowering it to 0.2 for consistency with other reports.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Score:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- **Analysis:** Very conservative, considering the code benign and no security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Score:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.3\n- **Analysis:** Similar to report 2, assigns a slightly higher risk based on the use of wildcard imports and external modules.\n- **Conclusion:** Acceptable, but again, the risk could be slightly lower, perhaps 0.2, unless further context suggests otherwise.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Score:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.2\n- **Analysis:** Reasonable, emphasizing that the code is just imports with no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- All reports assign 0 malware and obfuscated scores, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0**, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at **0**, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The **security risk score** could be slightly adjusted downward to **0.2** across reports, reflecting that the main concern is the use of wildcard imports, which is a best practice violation but not inherently dangerous.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type        | Suggested Value | Justification                                                  |\n|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                 | No evidence of malicious activity in the snippet.             |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                 | Code is straightforward; no obfuscation present.              |\n| Security Risk     | 0.2               | Wildcard imports can hide malicious code if modules are compromised, but no evidence here. |\n\n---\n\n### **Final note:**\nThe primary security concern is the contents of `logax` and `i`. Without inspecting those modules, the risk remains theoretical. The use of wildcard imports should be addressed as a coding best practice issue, not a security flaw per se.\n\n**Work conclusion:**  \n- The code itself is benign.  \n- The risk scores should be: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **securityRisk = 0.2**.",
