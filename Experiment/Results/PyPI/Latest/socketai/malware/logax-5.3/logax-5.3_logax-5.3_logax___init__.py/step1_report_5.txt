{
  "purpose": "The code is importing all symbols from local modules 'logax' and 'i', likely to use their functionalities elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules 'logax' and 'i'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code only performs imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling is evident in these import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure which symbols are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended behavior, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs minimal action—importing everything from two local modules. The use of wildcard imports can be considered poor practice, but it does not inherently indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior in these lines. Without additional context from the modules themselves, no malicious activity can be identified.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is simply importing modules with wildcard imports, which is a coding style concern but not an indication of malicious behavior. There are no evident security risks or malware in this code fragment.",
