  "purpose": "Configure the packaging and distribution settings for the Python library 'logax'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description; package dependencies listed in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reading file to assign to long_description, then used in setup configuration; dependencies declared in install_requires.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs setup configuration for a Python package. It reads a markdown file for documentation, then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All operations are standard for Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The dependencies listed are common libraries and do not pose immediate security risks. No unusual code structures, obfuscation, or secret handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package without any malicious intent or security issues. It is safe and appropriate for distribution.",
