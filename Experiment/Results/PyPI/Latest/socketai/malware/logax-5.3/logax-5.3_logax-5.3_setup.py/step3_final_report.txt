  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the 'logax' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; static data in setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Static data used directly in setup(); no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Listing 'importlib' as a dependency despite it being part of the Python standard library; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script that reads a README file and calls setup() with static, benign metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling is present. Dependencies are common packages; no obfuscation or malicious code detected. The inclusion of 'importlib' as an external dependency is unnecessary but not malicious. The code structure is straightforward and follows typical packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor issue is the unnecessary listing of 'importlib' as an external dependency, which does not impact security.",
