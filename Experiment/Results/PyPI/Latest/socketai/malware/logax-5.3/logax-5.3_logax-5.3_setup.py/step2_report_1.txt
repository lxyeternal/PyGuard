  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard, straightforward setup.py script.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n- The dependencies are common, benign packages.\n- No data flows involving untrusted input, no network activity, no code injection, or secret handling.\n- The code is static, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The code imports 'importlib' in the `install_requires` list. This is unusual because 'importlib' is part of the Python standard library since Python 3.1+. Listing it as an external dependency is unnecessary and might indicate a misunderstanding or oversight, but it does not introduce security risks.\n- No other anomalies or suspicious points are noted.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, I concur with their assessments.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious or security issues.\n- The only minor note is the unnecessary inclusion of 'importlib' in dependencies, but this does not affect security.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and consensus of the reports.",
