{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'logax' including metadata, dependencies, and package info.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static data within setup() such as name, version, author, url, dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks; no user input or external data handling occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; static configuration data is used throughout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and follows standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' functions, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with static metadata and dependencies. All data appears static and safe. No user input or external data sources are involved. The dependencies listed are common and benign. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The structure and content are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is standard and safe, containing no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies.",
