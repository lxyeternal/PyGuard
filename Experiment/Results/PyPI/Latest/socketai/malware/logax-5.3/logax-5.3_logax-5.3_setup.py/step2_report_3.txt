  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n- The code reads a README.md file for the long description and defines package metadata and dependencies.\n- Dependencies are common packages: requests, pybase64, importlib.\n- No data flows involving untrusted input, no network activity, no code injection, or data leaks are present.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating certainty in the benign nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n- No signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious behavior.\n- The dependencies are benign and typical for such a setup script.\n- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data are present.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the lack of any security issues.\n\n**Any necessary adjustments?**\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, safe setup.py script.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores reflect this assessment accurately.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- I concur with the reports' assessments.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No further action required.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis setup.py script is benign, typical, and poses no security concerns.",
