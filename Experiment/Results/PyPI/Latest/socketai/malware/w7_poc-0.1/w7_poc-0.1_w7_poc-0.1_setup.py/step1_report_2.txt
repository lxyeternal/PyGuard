  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'w7-poc' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package's long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it does not execute or invoke untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input or external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present; the code appears to be standard package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to specify package metadata and dependencies. It reads the long description from a file but does not execute any commands or include code that could be malicious. The description claims it executes a curl command upon installation, but there is no such command present in this script. Therefore, based solely on this code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and standard for Python package distribution. No malicious code or suspicious activity is detected in this fragment.",
