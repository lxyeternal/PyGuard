{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for a Python package named 'w7-poc'.",
  "sources": "Input is read from 'README.md' to populate the long_description field.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only defines package metadata and setup parameters.",
  "flows": "Read from 'README.md' flows into the long_description parameter of setup().",
  "anomalies": "The code references reading an external file 'README.md' but does not execute or include any command execution or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata, including name, version, packages, description, author, URL, classifiers, and Python version requirement. No untrusted input processing or execution of external commands occurs. Although the description mentions executing a curl command upon installation, no such command is actually present in this code. The code is standard setup.py configuration with no malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script only contains benign package configuration code with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The mention of executing a curl command is only in the description and is not implemented in the code itself.",
