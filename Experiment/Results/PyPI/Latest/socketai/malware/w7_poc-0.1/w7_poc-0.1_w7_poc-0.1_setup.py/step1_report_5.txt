{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'w7-poc'.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; import statements for setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data processing or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; setup configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "The description indicates execution of a curl command upon installation, but no such command is present in this code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It uses setuptools to find packages and set metadata. Despite the description mentioning executing a curl command upon installation, there is no code implementing such behavior in this snippet. The only dynamic operation is reading 'README.md' for the long description, which is typical and safe. No untrusted input handling, command execution, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears normal and benign based on the provided content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior detected. The discrepancy between the description and code suggests that the actual malicious behavior may be in another part of the package, not shown here. Based solely on this code, it appears safe.",
