  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or command executions present.",
  "flows": "Reads file content and passes static metadata to setup(), no data flows leading to execution or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Description mentions executing a curl command upon installation, but no such command exists in the code; this discrepancy is noted but not an actual code anomaly.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script defining package metadata. No commands, functions, or code snippets execute external commands or perform dynamic operations. The mention of executing a curl command is only in the description string, not in executable code. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The high confidence scores are justified due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. The discrepancy between description and code does not impact the security assessment; the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is benign and contains no malicious or suspicious code. The mention of executing a curl command appears only in the description and is not implemented here. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity. Therefore, the malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and overall security risk at 0. Final assessment confirms the package is safe based on this code snippet.",
