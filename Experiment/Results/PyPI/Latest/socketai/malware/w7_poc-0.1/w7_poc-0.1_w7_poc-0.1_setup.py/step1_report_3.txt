{
  "purpose": "The setup script is used to configure and install a Python package named 'w7-poc'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file to include a long description during package setup.",
  "targets": "No explicit targets or sinks for untrusted data are present in this setup script.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or system calls; the script primarily gathers static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The description states that the package executes a curl command upon installation, but there is no such command or code present within this script. The setup file itself does not contain executable code beyond package configuration, and it lacks any direct command execution, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code. The actual behavior (executing curl) is only mentioned in the description, not implemented here.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata. It reads the README.md file for a long description. There is no code in this script that performs any network operations, command execution, or data handling. The mention of executing a curl command is only in the description and not reflected in the code. Without additional code, no malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this script alone.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears standard and contains no malicious code or security risks. The mention of executing a curl command is only descriptive and not implemented here. There are no signs of supply chain attacks or malicious activity within this code fragment.",
