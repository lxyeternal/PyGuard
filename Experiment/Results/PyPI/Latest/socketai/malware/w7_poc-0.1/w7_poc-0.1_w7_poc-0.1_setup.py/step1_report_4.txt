  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'w7-poc'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; no untrusted data handling or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content for long_description during setup, no malicious data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior identified. The description mentions executing a curl command upon installation, but no such command is present in this code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. It reads package metadata, including the long description from 'README.md'. No executable code, network operations, or data manipulation occurs here. The mention of executing a curl command appears in the description but is not implemented in this code snippet, so it cannot be assessed for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, serving only to package the Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet.",
