      "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is benign and contains no malicious or suspicious code. The mention of executing a curl command appears only in the description and is not implemented here. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity. Therefore, the malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and overall security risk at 0. Final assessment confirms the package is safe based on this code snippet."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign based on the snippet; the main concern is the behavior of run_command(). Without inspecting its implementation, the security risk remains low but warrants further review. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero; risk score is moderate due to potential execution of system commands. Further investigation of install.run_command() is recommended to confirm safety."

The high scores in reports are based on an incorrect assumption about execution context. Adjusted scores should reflect low maliciousness and risk in current form, with potential for danger if modified to run with shell=True."
