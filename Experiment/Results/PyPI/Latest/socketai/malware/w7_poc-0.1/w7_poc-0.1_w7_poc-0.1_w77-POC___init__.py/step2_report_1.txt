  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their assessments, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: importing `run_command` from `.install` and executing it.\n- The core concern is the behavior of `run_command`, which is unknown.\n- The reports consistently assign low confidence and low malware/security risk scores, acknowledging that the actual risk depends on the implementation of `run_command`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code itself is simple and does not contain overt malicious activity. The main concern is the unknown behavior of `run_command`. The reports correctly identify that the actual risk hinges on the implementation of the imported function.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logical consistency:**  \n  All reports are consistent and cautious, emphasizing the unknown nature of `run_command`. No report claims malicious activity without evidence.  \n  No flaws in reasoning are apparent; the assessments appropriately reflect the limited information.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which seems reasonable given the straightforward code.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified unless `run_command` performs malicious actions.  \n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.3, which is appropriate considering the potential risk if `run_command` executes untrusted commands.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.3, which aligns with the cautious stance given the unknown implementation.\n\n### Malware considerations:\n- Since no evidence suggests malicious intent, malware scores are appropriately low (0).  \n- If `run_command` were to execute untrusted code, the malware score should be increased, but no such evidence exists here.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports correctly avoid assuming malicious behavior; they highlight the dependency on `run_command`'s implementation.\n\n### Score consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. The confidence levels are moderate, reflecting uncertainty but not suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2–0.3 (low, pending further inspection of `install.run_command`)  \n\n**Overall recommendation:**  \nThe code is minimal and appears benign, but the security implications depend entirely on `run_command`. It warrants further review of the `install` module to understand what `run_command` does.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and cautious.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed unless further details about `install.run_command` are provided.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (considering potential if `run_command` is malicious, but no evidence here)\n\n**Next step:**  \nInspect the implementation of `install.run_command` to accurately assess potential malicious activity.",
