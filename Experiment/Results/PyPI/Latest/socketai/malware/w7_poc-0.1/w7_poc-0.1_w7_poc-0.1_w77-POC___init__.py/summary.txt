  "conclusion": "The code appears benign based on the snippet; the main concern is the behavior of run_command(). Without inspecting its implementation, the security risk remains low but warrants further review. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero; risk score is moderate due to potential execution of system commands. Further investigation of install.run_command() is recommended to confirm safety."
