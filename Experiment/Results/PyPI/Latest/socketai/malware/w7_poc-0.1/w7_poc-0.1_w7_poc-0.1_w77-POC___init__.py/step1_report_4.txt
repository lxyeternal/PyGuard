{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes a function 'run_command' from a local module 'install', likely intended to perform some installation or setup process.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'install' to invoke 'run_command'.",
  "sinks": "The function 'run_command' may execute commands or perform actions that could affect the system, depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Importing 'run_command' from 'install' (source), then executing 'run_command()' (sink), potentially executing system commands if 'run_command' is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code complexity; the only potential concern is the behavior of 'run_command' which is not visible here. The code itself is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function and immediately executes it. The risk depends entirely on what 'run_command' does. Since 'install' is a local module and 'run_command' could be anything, the code's maliciousness cannot be determined solely from this snippet. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are present here. It is a simple invocation pattern. Without additional context about 'install' or 'run_command', the risk remains uncertain but appears to be a standard practice, assuming 'run_command' is a legitimate setup function.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary risk hinges on the behavior of 'run_command' in the 'install' module. As presented, the code itself is not inherently malicious but warrants review of 'install.run_command' for malicious actions or unintended system modifications.",
