{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes run_command from a local install module, likely for setup or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .install module; execution of run_command()",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of system commands within run_command() (unknown implementation)",
  "flows": "Import of run_command -> execution of run_command()",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; behavior depends entirely on install.run_command() implementation",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no visible malicious activity. The security implications hinge on the implementation of run_command(). All reports correctly identify this dependency and assign low malware and obfuscation scores. Risk scores are moderate (0.2-0.3), reflecting uncertainty about run_command() executing untrusted commands. Confidence levels are moderate, given the lack of implementation details. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present in the snippet itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign based on the snippet; the main concern is the behavior of run_command(). Without inspecting its implementation, the security risk remains low but warrants further review. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero; risk score is moderate due to potential execution of system commands. Further investigation of install.run_command() is recommended to confirm safety.",
