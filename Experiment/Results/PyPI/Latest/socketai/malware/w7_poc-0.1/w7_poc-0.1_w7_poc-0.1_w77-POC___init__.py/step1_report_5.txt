{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes a function called run_command from a local module named install.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'install' and the run_command function within it.",
  "sinks": "The run_command function potentially executes commands that may affect the system or perform actions.",
  "flows": "Import from .install -> call run_command() -> execute its code",
  "anomalies": "The code directly executes run_command() without any input validation or context, which could be risky depending on its implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module and executes it immediately. Without inspecting the implementation of run_command(), it is impossible to determine if it performs malicious actions. The pattern itself is common in Python scripts, but if run_command() executes system commands or performs sensitive operations without safeguards, it could be malicious. The minimal code provides no evidence of malicious behavior by itself but relies heavily on what run_command() does.",
  "conclusion": "The code by itself is not explicitly malicious; it simply imports and runs a function. The security risk depends entirely on the implementation of run_command(). Without further context, it cannot be confirmed as malicious, but the pattern warrants caution if run_command() performs sensitive or unsafe operations.",
