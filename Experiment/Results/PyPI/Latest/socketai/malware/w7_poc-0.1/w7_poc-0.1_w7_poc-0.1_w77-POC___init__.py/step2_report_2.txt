  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, considering the code snippet and the provided assessments.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .install import run_command\n\nrun_command()\n```\n\n**Summary of observations:**\n- The code imports `run_command` from a local module `.install`.\n- It immediately executes `run_command()`.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are visible.\n- The behavior and potential risks hinge entirely on the implementation of `install.run_command`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code itself does not contain malicious activity or vulnerabilities; it’s minimal and straightforward. The risk arises only if `run_command()` performs malicious actions, which cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- All reports correctly identify that the core concern depends on the implementation of `run_command`.\n- They consistently note the absence of obfuscation and suspicious patterns.\n- The reports appropriately highlight that executing an imported function can be risky if that function is malicious or untrusted.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate given the information; there's no evidence of malicious behavior in the snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All `0`, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting a low but non-zero concern due to reliance on external implementation.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- No scores above 0.5 are assigned, which aligns with the fact that the code alone doesn't demonstrate malicious activity.\n- The overall risk is contingent on the behavior of `install.run_command`.\n\n### Critical points:\n- **Potential maliciousness:** If `run_command()` executes untrusted system commands, the risk could be high. But since that is unknown, the conservative approach is to keep scores low.\n- **Assumptions:** The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions, correctly emphasizing that the risk depends on implementation.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores across reports are consistent with their analyses and the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the information, **the actual malware, obfuscated, and overall risk scores should remain low** because:\n- No evidence of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- The execution of `run_command()` is potentially risky but not necessarily malicious.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 - 0.3 (reflecting cautious acknowledgment of potential risk depending on implementation)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are thorough and reasonable.\n- The core concern is the unknown behavior of `install.run_command`.\n- No changes needed in scoring; the assessments are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores but recommend a review of the `install` module's `run_command` implementation to confirm its safety before deployment or use in sensitive environments.",
