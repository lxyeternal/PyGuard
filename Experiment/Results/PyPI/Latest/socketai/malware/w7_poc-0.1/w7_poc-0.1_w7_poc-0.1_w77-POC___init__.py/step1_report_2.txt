{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes a function named run_command from a local module named install, likely intended to perform some installation or setup task.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module (install), which could potentially include any code the module contains.",
  "sinks": "The run_command() function is called directly; if it executes untrusted input or system commands, it could be a sink.",
  "flows": "The code imports run_command and executes it immediately; any malicious behavior depends on the implementation of run_command.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, but without the implementation of run_command, its behavior cannot be fully determined. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function from a local module and executes it. Since the behavior depends entirely on what run_command does, and that code is not provided, the risk assessment is limited. If run_command executes system commands or handles untrusted input, there could be potential security issues. However, the snippet itself is simple and does not exhibit malicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears to execute a function from a local module. Without further details about run_command's implementation, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The overall risk is low based on the provided snippet, but the security implications depend on the code within install.run_command.",
