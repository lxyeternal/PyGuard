{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'run_command' from a local module 'install' and executes it, likely to run a command or script.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'install' via the import statement.",
  "sinks": "The execution of 'run_command()' can potentially be a sink if it executes untrusted commands or inputs.",
  "flows": "The import retrieves 'run_command' from 'install'; calling 'run_command()' executes the function, which may perform further actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; without the implementation of 'run_command', it's impossible to determine if it performs malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports and executes a function named 'run_command' from a local module. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'run_command' within 'install'. Given only this snippet, no malicious behavior can be confirmed or denied. The code is simple and does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. However, executing an imported function that may run system commands can be risky if the function's contents are malicious or untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code by itself is not inherently malicious but executing 'run_command()' could pose security risks depending on its implementation. Without further context, the potential for malicious activity cannot be confirmed, but the minimal nature of this snippet warrants cautious review of the 'install' module.",
