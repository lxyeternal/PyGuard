{
  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to a specified webhook URL for telemetry purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, IP address, OS details, Python version, current directory, and timestamp.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP POST request to a fixed external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered and directly posted to the webhook URL without validation or user consent.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation or malicious code; data collection is straightforward. The webhook URL is hardcoded, raising privacy concerns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple telemetry class that collects system info and transmits it silently to an external URL. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or code injection are present. The data collected is non-sensitive system info, and the transmission occurs without user notification. The hardcoded webhook URL could be used for covert data exfiltration, raising privacy issues. The malware score is low (0), as no malicious activity is detected. The security risk score is moderate (around 0.2), reflecting privacy implications but not active malicious intent. The code's behavior is benign but privacy-invasive.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs benign system telemetry with privacy concerns due to silent data transmission to a fixed URL. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The scores should reflect low malware risk (0), no obfuscation (0), and a low to moderate security risk (~0.2), primarily due to privacy implications.",
