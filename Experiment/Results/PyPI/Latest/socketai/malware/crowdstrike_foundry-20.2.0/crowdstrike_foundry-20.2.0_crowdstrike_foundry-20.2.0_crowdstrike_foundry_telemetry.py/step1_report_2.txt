  "purpose": "The code gathers system information and sends it to a specified webhook URL, likely for telemetry or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostbyname, socket.gethostname, socket.getfqdn, platform.system, platform.version, platform.release, platform.python_version, os.path.abspath, os.getcwd, datetime.utcnow",
  "sinks": "requests.post to the specified webhook URL with system information as JSON payload",
  "flows": "Sources (system info gathering) flow into send_telemetry, which posts data to the webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded webhook URL; collects extensive system info including IP address, hostname, FQDN, OS details, Python version, and current working directory without user consent; no data validation or encryption; no apparent user notification or consent mechanism",
  "analysis": "The script defines a class that, upon instantiation, immediately collects detailed system information and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded webhook URL. The data includes IP address, hostname, FQDN, OS details, Python version, and directory paths. The code does not require user input, does not obfuscate or hide its behavior, and runs silently without notifications. The use of a fixed webhook suggests the data is sent to a specific endpoint potentially controlled by an attacker or for malicious monitoring. No malicious code, such as data exfiltration of user credentials or backdoors, is directly observed, but the activity itself resembles covert data collection and transmission. The absence of user consent and the persistent nature imply potential malicious intent, especially if used without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system data collection and sends it to an external webhook URL without user consent or notification, which is suspicious. It does not contain explicit malicious payloads like malware, but its behavior of silent data exfiltration and hardcoded webhook indicates potentially malicious or privacy-invasive intent. Overall, the activity warrants caution due to its covert data collection nature.",
