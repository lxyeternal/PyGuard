  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to a specified webhook URL for telemetry purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system information such as IP address, hostname, OS details, Python version, current working directory, and timestamp.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST request to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system info functions and sent directly to the webhook via an HTTP request.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded webhook URL; sends potentially sensitive system info without user consent or explicit permission.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Telemetry class that, upon initialization, gathers detailed system information and immediately posts this data to an external webhook URL. The system info includes IP address, hostnames, OS details, and directory paths. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which could be used maliciously if misused or if the URL is malicious. The code does not include any obfuscation or malicious system commands, but it performs data exfiltration without user consent. No other suspicious behaviors such as code injection or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a telemetry script that exfiltrates system info to an external server. While it does not contain malicious code per se, its purpose and the hardcoded webhook URL suggest it could be used for unauthorized data collection and exfiltration. No malware or malicious intent is explicitly evident, but it poses privacy and security concerns due to lack of transparency and user consent.",
