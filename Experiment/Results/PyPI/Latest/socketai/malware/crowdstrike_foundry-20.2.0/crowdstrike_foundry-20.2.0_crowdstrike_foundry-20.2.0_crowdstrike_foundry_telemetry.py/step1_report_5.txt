  "purpose": "Collect and send system telemetry data to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostbyname, socket.gethostname, socket.getfqdn, platform.* functions, os.path.abspath, os.getcwd, datetime.utcnow, requests.post",
  "sinks": "requests.post (sending data to external URL), reading hostname and IP (potential privacy leak if misused)",
  "flows": "get_system_info collects data from system calls and environment, then send_telemetry posts this data to the webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials other than the webhook URL, which is a fixed external URL. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which could be a concern if it points to a malicious endpoint. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system information such as IP address, hostname, OS details, Python version, and current directory. It then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a specified webhook URL. The data collection methods use standard library functions, and the HTTP request is straightforward. No user input handling, no dynamic URL generation, and no suspicious data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The fixed webhook URL might be used for legitimate telemetry or malicious purposes; further context is needed. Overall, the code appears to perform system info collection and reporting, which by itself is not malicious, but the intent depends on the usage context.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects system environment details and transmits them to an external URL. It does not contain any malicious behavior such as data theft, backdoors, or malicious network activity beyond reporting. The fixed webhook URL could be a privacy concern if used maliciously, but based solely on the code, it appears to be for telemetry purposes.",
