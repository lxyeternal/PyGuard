  "purpose": "Initialize telemetry tracking upon import of the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement for .telemetry module; instantiation of Telemetry object.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are evident in this snippet; potential data collection depends on Telemetry implementation.",
  "flows": "Import of Telemetry -> creation of telemetry instance at import -> potential internal data handling by Telemetry class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward initialization. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local telemetry module and creates an instance of Telemetry immediately upon import, with a version string defined. No network activity, data transmission, or suspicious operations are visible. The security implications depend entirely on the internal implementation of the Telemetry class, which is not provided. The code is minimal, clear, and free of obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The reports correctly identify the pattern and assign a malware score of 0, reflecting no evidence of malicious activity. The risk score is low (~0.2), indicating privacy considerations but no active threat. Confidence in the benign nature of this code is high, given its simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a standard telemetry initialization routine with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code. The primary concern is privacy, not security. Without the implementation details of the Telemetry class, the assessment cannot be definitive, but based on this snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious behavior.",
