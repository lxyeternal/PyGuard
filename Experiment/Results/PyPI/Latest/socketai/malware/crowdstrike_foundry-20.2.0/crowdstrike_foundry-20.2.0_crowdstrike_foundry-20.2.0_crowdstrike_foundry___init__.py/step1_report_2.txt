  "purpose": "Initialize telemetry collection when the package is imported.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing Telemetry from a local module; initialization of telemetry object.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Import of Telemetry module -> creation of telemetry object -> potential telemetry data collection (implied).",
  "anomalies": "Absence of actual telemetry data transmission code; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a telemetry class from a local module and initializes an instance immediately upon import. This suggests telemetry data collection or monitoring may occur, but no explicit data transmission, network activity, or data handling is shown here. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or backdoors is evident. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform telemetry initialization, which could be used for legitimate usage such as diagnostics or analytics. There is no evidence of malicious behavior based on this snippet alone.",
