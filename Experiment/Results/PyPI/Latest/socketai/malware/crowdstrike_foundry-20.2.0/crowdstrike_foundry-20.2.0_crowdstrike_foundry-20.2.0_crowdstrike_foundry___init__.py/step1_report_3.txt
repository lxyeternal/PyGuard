  "purpose": "Initialize telemetry component for data collection or monitoring within the package",
  "sources": "Import statement importing Telemetry class; instantiation of telemetry object",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling evident in this code",
  "flows": "Import of Telemetry -> creation of telemetry object at import time",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward initialization",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local Telemetry class and creates an instance immediately upon package import. The version string is also defined. No handling of external input, no use of environment variables, or sensitive data. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic present. The purpose appears to be to enable telemetry features, which could raise privacy considerations but does not imply malicious intent within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard initialization of a telemetry object and defines a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
