  "purpose": "Initialize telemetry tracking when the package is imported.",
  "sources": "Import statement for telemetry module, instantiation of Telemetry object",
  "sinks": "Potentially sending data over network or storing telemetry data",
  "flows": "Import -> Telemetry() constructor execution (potentially sending data)",
  "anomalies": "Use of telemetry suggests data collection, but no suspicious or malicious activity is evident in this snippet alone.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a telemetry module and creates an instance upon import, indicating telemetry data collection. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or suspicious logic. Without seeing the implementation of Telemetry, no malicious activity can be confirmed, but the presence of telemetry could be used maliciously if misused.",
  "conclusion": "This code sets up telemetry collection upon module import. While this can be a privacy concern, there is no explicit malicious behavior or malware in this snippet. The risk depends on the implementation of the Telemetry class, which is not provided.",
