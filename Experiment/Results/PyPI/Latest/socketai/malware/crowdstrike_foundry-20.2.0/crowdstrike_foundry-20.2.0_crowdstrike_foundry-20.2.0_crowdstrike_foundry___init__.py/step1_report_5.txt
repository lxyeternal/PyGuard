  "purpose": "Initialize telemetry for data collection or usage tracking when the package is imported.",
  "sources": "Importing Telemetry module; instantiating Telemetry class",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could leak or cause harm in this snippet",
  "flows": "Import of module -> instantiation of Telemetry object",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; standard telemetry initialization, but the nature of the Telemetry class is unknown. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code seen.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module 'telemetry', creates an instance of 'Telemetry', and sets a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or obfuscated code. Without the implementation of the Telemetry class, it's impossible to determine if it performs malicious actions, but the pattern itself is common for telemetry collection. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward telemetry setup typical in packages for usage analytics or tracking. There are no immediate signs of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment. Further analysis of the 'Telemetry' class implementation would be needed for a complete assessment.",
