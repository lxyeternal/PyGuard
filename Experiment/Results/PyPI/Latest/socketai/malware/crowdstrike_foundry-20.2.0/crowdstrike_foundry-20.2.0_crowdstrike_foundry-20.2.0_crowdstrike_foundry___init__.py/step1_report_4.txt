  "purpose": "Initialize telemetry tracking when the package is imported",
  "sources": "Import statement for telemetry module, instantiation of Telemetry object",
  "sinks": "Potentially sends data via the Telemetry object (not shown here), but the code itself does not specify network activity or data transmission",
  "flows": "Import of telemetry module -> creation of Telemetry instance -> potential data collection and transmission (implied but not shown in code)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward initialization without suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports a telemetry module and initializes an instance immediately upon import. The purpose appears to be to collect telemetry data. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity within this snippet. The telemetry object may perform data collection, but this cannot be confirmed solely from this code. The version string is standard metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple telemetry initialization routine with no immediate signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Its intent seems to be to enable telemetry collection, which is common in software packages, but care should be taken to verify what the Telemetry class does in its implementation.",
