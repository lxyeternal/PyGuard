{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the Python package 'crowdstrike-foundry' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Read operations on 'README.md' for long description, static string declarations for package metadata, and 'find_packages()' to discover package modules.",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no untrusted data handling or output involved.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no input-output data flows involving untrusted sources; setup parameters are static or file-based read.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without context managers; no explicit validation or sanitization, but this is standard in setup scripts. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' to configure package setup, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. It reads the 'README.md' file for long description, which is common practice. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The script does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior; it appears to be a typical package setup script with standard practices. No anomalies or signs of obfuscation or malware are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup configuration script for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code follows standard packaging procedures without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
