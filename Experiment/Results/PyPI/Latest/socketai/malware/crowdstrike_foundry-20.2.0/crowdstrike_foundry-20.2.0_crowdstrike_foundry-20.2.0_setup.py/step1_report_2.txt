{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'crowdstrike-foundry'.",
  "sources": "Reading package requirements, package discovery via find_packages(), reading the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data is being used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical operations. The only file read is the README.md for description.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads 'README.md' without error handling, which is standard for setup scripts but could cause issues if the file is missing. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. There are no indications of malicious code, such as network activity, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors. All operations are typical for a package setup file. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies were observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
