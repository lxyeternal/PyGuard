  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data handling beyond local file read.",
  "flows": "Static data read from local 'README.md' into package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of 'open' without validation, which is typical in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional 'setup.py' script utilizing setuptools. It imports setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and reads the long description from a local file. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The only potential concern is reading 'README.md' without error handling, but this is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected. The code's simplicity and adherence to common packaging patterns indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign Python package setup file with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. Minor concerns about reading files without validation are standard and do not constitute security issues. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and legitimacy.",
