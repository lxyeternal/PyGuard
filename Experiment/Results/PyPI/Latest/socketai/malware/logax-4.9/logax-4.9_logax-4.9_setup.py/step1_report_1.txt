  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package named 'logax' for distribution",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long_description; setting package metadata and dependencies",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input; no network or data leakage points",
  "flows": "Read README.md content -> setup configuration -> install dependencies",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures using setuptools. It reads a README file for long description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. The dependencies include requests, pybase64, and importlib, all common libraries. No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or suspicious behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
