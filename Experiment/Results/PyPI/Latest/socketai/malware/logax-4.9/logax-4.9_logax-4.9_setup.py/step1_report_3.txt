  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'logax' Python library",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; setting package metadata and dependencies",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling; no network or sensitive data operations",
  "flows": "Reading file -> configuring setup parameters -> installing dependencies",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions, reads a README file for description, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are standard for Python package setup. The dependencies are common libraries ('requests', 'pybase64', 'importlib') with no indication of malicious intent. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, legitimate setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
