  "flows": "Importing potentially untrusted code or data from 'info' into the current namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) which can introduce hidden or malicious code, or override existing variables without explicit control.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a wildcard import from a local module 'info'. While on its own this does not indicate malicious behavior, such imports can obscure which functions or variables are introduced, possibly hiding malicious code. The code snippet is minimal and does not show any malicious actions directly, but the use of wildcard import is a common pattern that can be abused to hide malicious payloads or override critical functions. No other suspicious or malicious code is visible in this single line, but the practice of wildcard import warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wildcard import from a local module. While not inherently malicious, this pattern can be used to hide malicious code or override important functions. No direct malicious behavior is observed, but the import style should be scrutinized in context.",
