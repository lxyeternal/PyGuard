{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'info'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'info' module in the current package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the import could influence downstream code if 'info' contains malicious content or code execution triggers.",
  "flows": "Imported contents from 'info' may influence subsequent code execution; however, no explicit flow is shown here.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .info import *' can be risky because it imports all symbols without explicit control, potentially importing malicious or unwanted code, but on its own, it is not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement that imports everything from a local module 'info'. This pattern is common for setting up namespace or configurations. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are evident. Without seeing the 'info' module, it's impossible to determine if it contains malicious code. The import itself is standard but can be risky if 'info' is malicious or compromised.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the single import statement, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. However, the reliance on an imported module 'info' could pose risks if that module is malicious or compromised, but cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
