  "conclusion": "The code is benign on its own but employs a pattern that can hide malicious code if 'info' is malicious. No direct evidence of malicious behavior is present. The scores are appropriate given the context, emphasizing the importance of reviewing the 'info' module. The main risk is the potential for malicious content within 'info', which cannot be determined from this snippet alone."
