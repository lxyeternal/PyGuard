  "purpose": "Imports all contents from the local module 'info'.",
  "sources": "The import statement imports data from a local module file named 'info'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs within this snippet; potential sinks would depend on subsequent code using imported content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'info' module into the current namespace; no further flow is visible in this single line.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement is straightforward; however, importing all ('*') can be risky as it may include unexpected or malicious code if 'info' contains malicious content. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious code in this line alone.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports all definitions from a local module named 'info'. Without examining the contents of 'info', we cannot determine if it contains malicious code or secrets. The import syntax itself is standard and not suspicious, but using 'from .info import *' can hide imported objects, which might be used maliciously if 'info' is malicious or compromised. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues solely from this line.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this single line. The main concern would be the contents of 'info', which are not provided. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants caution if 'info' is untrusted.",
