  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .info import *`.\n- The core concern revolves around the use of wildcard import, which can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious code if 'info' is compromised.\n- None of the reports provide the content of the 'info' module, so the actual maliciousness cannot be definitively assessed from this snippet alone.\n- The scores assigned to malware are all zero, indicating no direct evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Presence\n- **Is the reported code present?** Yes, all reports describe the same import statement, which is present.\n- **Is there any malicious code directly visible?** No, the code snippet only shows an import statement.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes\n- The reports correctly identify that `from .info import *` is a risky pattern because it obscures imported symbols.\n- They appropriately note that without inspecting 'info', the maliciousness cannot be determined.\n- The reasoning is consistent across reports; no contradictions are apparent.\n\n### Score Justifications\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of visible malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is reasonable given the straightforward import statement.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting moderate concern due to wildcard import but no direct malicious activity.\n\n### Potential Inconsistencies\n- The confidence levels vary slightly (0.4 to 0.6), which is acceptable given the limited information.\n- The scores seem consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n### Critical Evaluation\n- The reports correctly identify that the use of wildcard import can be exploited if 'info' contains malicious code.\n- Since no evidence of malicious code is present, the malware score remains at 0.\n- The security risk score could be slightly higher if the context suggests that 'info' might be untrusted, but given only this snippet, the current scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is demonstrated.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remains at 0; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for malicious 'info' content, a slight increase could be justified if context suggests untrusted sources, but based solely on this snippet, 0.2-0.3 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- The code itself is benign but uses a pattern that can hide malicious content if 'info' is compromised.\n- Without further context or content of 'info', no definitive malicious activity can be assigned.\n- The current scores are reasonable and reflect cautious suspicion rather than confirmed malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to 0.3 if considering potential for hidden malicious code in 'info')\n\nThis cautious approach aligns with the evidence and standard security assessment practices.",
