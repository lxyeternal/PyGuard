{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'info'.",
  "sources": "The import statement is a source where code reads data from the 'info' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or output data directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'info' module into the current namespace via import *.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'import *' can hide the actual data being imported and may lead to namespace pollution, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of all symbols from a relative module 'info'. This pattern can obscure what data is being brought into scope, which is a common concern for readability and maintainability, but does not by itself indicate malicious intent. No other code, such as data processing, network activity, or sensitive operations, is present to evaluate further.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement with no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The use of 'import *' is potentially risky for code clarity but is not malicious per se.",
