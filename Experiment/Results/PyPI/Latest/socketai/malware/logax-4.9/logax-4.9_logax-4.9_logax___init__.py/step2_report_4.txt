  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\nThis line performs a wildcard import from a local module `info`. It is a common Python pattern but can obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious code if `info` is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `info`.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes that wildcard import can hide malicious code but notes no malicious behavior directly.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0.3, Confidence 0.6.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the import itself isn't malicious but can be exploited if `info` is malicious. The score seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Emphasizes that the content of `info` determines maliciousness, not the import statement alone.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0.3, Confidence 0.4.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The lower confidence reflects less certainty. The risk score is appropriate given the potential for malicious `info`.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Similar reasoning; no evidence of malicious code in the import line.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.6.\n\n**Assessment:** The risk score is slightly lower here, which is acceptable. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Notes that the import can influence subsequent code if `info` is malicious but no direct evidence.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.6.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; the potential risk is acknowledged without evidence.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Highlights namespace pollution but no malicious activity.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.5.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the snippet alone.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, consistent; no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Risk scores:** Vary between 0.2 and 0.3, reflecting potential but unconfirmed risk due to the use of `import *`.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the reasoning.\n- The main concern is the content of `info`, which cannot be assessed here.\n- The risk scores could be slightly increased if the context suggests that `info` could be malicious, but given the information, current scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code in the import statement).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected).\n- **Risk score:** 0.2–0.3, reflecting potential risk due to wildcard import, which is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to reflect the potential danger of importing untrusted code via wildcard import)\n\nThis conservative estimate aligns with the evidence and reasoning provided.",
