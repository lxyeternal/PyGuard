  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   All reports describe the same minimal code snippet:\n   ```python\n   from .info import *\n   ```\n   This line is straightforward and consistent across reports. No actual malicious code or behavior is directly visible in this snippet. The main concern revolves around the use of wildcard import (`*`), which can hide imported symbols and potentially mask malicious or unwanted code if the `info` module is compromised.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that `from .info import *` is a wildcard import and note its potential risks.\n   - They also correctly state that, on its own, this line does not indicate malicious behavior but could be exploited if the `info` module is malicious.\n   - No factual errors are evident; the reasoning aligns with Python best practices and common security considerations.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - The reports assign `malware` scores of 0 or 0.2, and `securityRisk` scores mostly around 0.2–0.3, with some at 0.5.\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the minimal code and the context that the actual `info` module's content is unknown.\n   - Since no malicious code is visible, a malware score of 0 is justified unless the `info` module is malicious, which cannot be determined here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - The highest `securityRisk` score is 0.3, which seems appropriate for a pattern that can be risky if the imported module is malicious.\n   - The `malware` scores are mostly 0, which is justified given no evidence of malicious code.\n   - The scores are consistent with the reports' cautious stance.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - Since the code only imports from a local module and does not perform any suspicious actions, the malware score should remain at 0 unless there is evidence that `info` is malicious.\n   - The reports do not provide evidence of malicious content in `info`, so a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly state that the security implications depend on the content of the `info` module.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about maliciousness are made; they emphasize the need to review the `info` module itself.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores align with the analysis: low malware risk, moderate security risk due to the use of wildcard import, and no obfuscation.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code snippet itself is benign but potentially risky if the `info` module is malicious or compromised.\n- The reports are cautious and accurate, emphasizing the importance of reviewing the `info` module.\n- The scores are appropriate given the information.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2–0.3 (due to the wildcard import pattern, which can hide malicious content if `info` is malicious)\n\n**Final note:**\nThe real security concern hinges on the content of the `info` module, which cannot be assessed here. The import pattern itself is standard but can be dangerous if the imported module is malicious. Therefore, the best practice is to avoid wildcard imports and review the `info` module thoroughly.",
