{
  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'info' within the same package",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local module 'info' in the current package",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could originate from the imported 'info' module if it contains malicious code, but the import itself is not a sink; it is a source",
  "flows": "Code execution depends on the contents of 'info'; if 'info' contains malicious code, it could execute during import, affecting the environment",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .info import *' can obscure which names are imported and may hide malicious code or backdoors within the 'info' module; no other code present that indicates suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement importing all symbols from a local module named 'info'. This practice can hide malicious code if 'info' contains harmful instructions. Since the code does not reveal what 'info' does, the security implications depend on that module's content. The import itself is standard Python syntax but can be exploited if the 'info' module is malicious. No other code or data flow is present to analyze.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and solely imports from a local module. Without examining 'info', the maliciousness or security risk cannot be fully determined. The use of wildcard import ('*') can obscure malicious code hidden in 'info'. Overall, this is a potential vector if 'info' is malicious but not inherently malicious by itself.",
