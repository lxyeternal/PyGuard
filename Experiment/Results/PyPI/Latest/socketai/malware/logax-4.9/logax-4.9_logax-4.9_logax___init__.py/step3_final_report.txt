  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local module 'info' using a wildcard import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no other data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, any imported symbols could be used in subsequent code to perform malicious actions, but none are shown here.",
  "flows": "The import brings symbols into the namespace; subsequent usage (not shown) could be a source-to-sink path for malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') which can obscure imported symbols and mask malicious or unwanted code; no other anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward wildcard import from a local module 'info'. This pattern is risky because it can hide malicious code if 'info' is compromised. No malicious actions are directly visible, and the code is not obfuscated. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with the minimal code and the potential threat stemming from the import pattern. The overall security concern hinges on the trustworthiness of 'info', which cannot be assessed here. The import pattern itself is standard but can be exploited if 'info' contains malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign on its own but employs a pattern that can hide malicious code if 'info' is malicious. No direct evidence of malicious behavior is present. The scores are appropriate given the context, emphasizing the importance of reviewing the 'info' module. The main risk is the potential for malicious content within 'info', which cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
