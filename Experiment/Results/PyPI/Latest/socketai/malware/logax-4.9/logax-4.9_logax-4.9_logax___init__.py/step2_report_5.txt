  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .info import *`.\n- No other code is provided, so we lack context on what 'info' contains or how the imported symbols are used.\n- The core concern is that wildcard imports can hide malicious code or override critical functions, especially if 'info' is malicious or compromised.\n- The reports consistently assign low malware scores (0), reflecting that the code itself isn't inherently malicious but notes potential risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 1: Confirmed presence of the issue?**\n\nYes. The code `from .info import *` is present in all reports. No discrepancies here.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 2: Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning**\n\n- **Logical consistency:** All reports correctly identify that the import pattern is risky because it can hide malicious code if 'info' is malicious.\n- **Potential oversight:** None of the reports mention whether 'info' is trusted or not. The security implications heavily depend on the content of 'info', which isn't provided.\n- **Assessment of maliciousness:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the fact that the import statement alone isn't malicious but could be dangerous if 'info' is malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are logically consistent and cautious. No major flaws are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 3: Review of scores assigned**\n\n- **Confidence scores:** Range from 0.4 to 0.6, reflecting moderate confidence that the import pattern is a concern but not necessarily malicious.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** 0 in all reports, which is reasonable given the straightforward code.\n- **Malware scores:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given no evidence of malicious code.\n- **SecurityRisk scores:** Mostly 0.2-0.3, indicating some concern about the import pattern but not high.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n- The malware scores could be increased **if** additional context suggested malicious intent or known malicious 'info' modules. But with current info, 0 seems justified.\n- The security risk scores are consistent with the potential for misuse but not confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 4: Justification for risk scores > 0.5**\n\n- No report assigns a risk score > 0.5, which seems appropriate.\n- The risk mainly stems from the potential for malicious 'info' modules or malicious use of imported symbols, not from the import statement itself.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 5: Malware score justification**\n\n- Since no evidence of malicious behavior is present, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n- If 'info' were known to be malicious, this would change, but based solely on the snippet, the current scores are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 6: Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports assume that 'info' could be malicious, which is valid.\n- They do not assume maliciousness outright, which is appropriate.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 7: Consistency of scores with report content**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the cautious approach taken in all reports.\n- The low malware and obfuscated scores match the minimal code shown.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Based on the provided code snippet and reports:**\n\n- The code is benign on its own but can be a vector if 'info' contains malicious code.\n- The reports correctly highlight the potential risk of using wildcard imports.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 (moderate concern due to import pattern, but not high risk)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nWhile the code itself isn't malicious, wildcard imports can be dangerous if the imported module is compromised. Without evidence that 'info' is malicious, the risk remains moderate but not high.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and cautious.\n- The scores are appropriate given the information.\n- The main concern is the trustworthiness of the 'info' module, which cannot be assessed here.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nFurther investigation should include examining the contents of 'info' to determine if it contains malicious code or backdoors. If 'info' is trusted, the risk diminishes; if not, the risk increases.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways prefer explicit imports over wildcard imports to reduce namespace pollution and improve code clarity, especially in security-sensitive contexts.",
