{
  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'tronclipy', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; static strings for package metadata; 'install_requires' list; 'project_urls' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no code execution or data leak points.",
  "flows": "N/A – all data is static or file-based configuration; no input/output flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors. Usage of standard setup tools with no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python packaging practices with 'setuptools'. It reads a README file for the long description, sets package metadata, and specifies dependencies and URLs. There are no dynamic code executions, no handling of user input, and no sensitive data embedded. All operations are static and typical for package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.",
