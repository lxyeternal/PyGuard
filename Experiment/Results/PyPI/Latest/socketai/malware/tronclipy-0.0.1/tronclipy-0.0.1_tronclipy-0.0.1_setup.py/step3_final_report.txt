  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'tronclipy', configuring metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with placeholder URL and email domain but no malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, no user input, no embedded secrets, and no obfuscation. All external references are placeholders. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code are present. The minor unconventional email domain and placeholder URL do not indicate malicious intent. The code adheres to standard packaging practices and poses no security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
