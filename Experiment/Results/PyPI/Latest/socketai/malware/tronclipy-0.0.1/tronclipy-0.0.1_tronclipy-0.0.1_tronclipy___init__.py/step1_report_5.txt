  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'main' module from the same package.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present in this line.",
  "flows": "This line only imports code; no data flows are established here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import of a specific object or function named 'perm' from a local module 'main'. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. As the code is only an import statement, it does not perform any data processing, network activity, or other potentially malicious actions. Without additional context or code, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious activity or security issues. It appears to be a standard part of a Python module.",
