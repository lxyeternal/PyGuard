  "purpose": "The code imports the 'perm' object or function from the 'main' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local 'main' module",
  "sinks": "None in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flow is visible in this isolated snippet; it only performs a static import",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, but the presence of a relative import could be suspicious if the package structure is manipulated or unusual. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a simple relative import from the 'main' module, importing 'perm'. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior in this isolated snippet. Without additional context, it appears to be standard import syntax. However, the snippet alone provides limited information; it does not execute any logic or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving a basic import purpose with no malicious intent detected. It is a standard Python import statement with no apparent security issues.",
