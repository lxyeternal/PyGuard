{
  "purpose": "The code imports the symbol 'perm' from a local module 'main', likely for use within the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or sinks are present; the code only performs a static import.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the import is static and isolated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward import statement: 'from .main import perm'. It does not execute any code, handle data, or communicate externally. The import syntax is standard in Python packages, and no malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate. The security risk score is mostly 0, with a minor elevation to 0.1 in one report due to potential package structure concerns, but this is negligible given the code snippet. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the benign nature of the code. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
