  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local 'main' module, likely for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "The source is the local import statement from .main",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; this is only an import statement with no data processing or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flow is visible; this code only establishes an import link",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement importing 'perm' from a relative module 'main'. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no external network interactions. As it stands, it appears to be a standard import used in Python projects, with no malicious indicators. The minimal nature of this code makes it unlikely to contain malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious activity, malware, or security risks. It does not pose a threat in its current form.",
