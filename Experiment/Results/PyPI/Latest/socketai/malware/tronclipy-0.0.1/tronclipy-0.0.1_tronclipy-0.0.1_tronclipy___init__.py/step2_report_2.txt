  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code is a straightforward import statement; no issues are present.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None identified.\n   - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. This aligns with the minimal code and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - **Justification:** The code is benign, and the score reflects that.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above, a simple import.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The high confidence (1) is justified.\n   - **Justification:** No malicious indicators; the import is standard.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue presence:** Still just an import statement.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** No.\n   - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), which is reasonable given the minimal context.\n   - **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as others; no issues.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** The mention of relative import could be suspicious if package structure is unusual, but no evidence here.\n   - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1. The small risk score seems a bit high given the minimal code, but perhaps it accounts for potential structural concerns.\n   - **Justification:** Without further context, the risk score could be slightly lowered to 0, but 0.1 is acceptable as a conservative measure.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue presence:** No issues; a simple import.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The confidence is high, consistent with the simplicity.\n   - **Justification:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The scores are generally consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- The only minor point is the risk score of 0.1 in report 4, which could be slightly lowered, but it is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, since the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain at 0 for all, except perhaps a very slight adjustment for report 4, but overall, 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The scores are reasonable, and no further action is necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code snippet.",
