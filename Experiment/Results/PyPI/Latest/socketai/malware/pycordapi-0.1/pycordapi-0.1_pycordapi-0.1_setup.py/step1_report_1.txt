{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the standard installation process to download and execute a file from an external URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current working directory (os.getcwd()), constructs download and open commands, and executes external PowerShell commands via subprocess.run.",
  "sinks": "Execution of PowerShell commands that download and open a file ('CBLines.exe') from an external source, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a download command from the URL and executes it, then if successful, constructs an open command to launch the downloaded file, which could be malicious executable.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and automatically executes an external file during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious. The URL appears hardcoded, and executing downloaded executables without user consent is risky.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard setuptools install command. It downloads a file ('CBLines.exe') from a specific GitHub URL using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest, then immediately attempts to execute this file with Start-Process. This behavior bypasses typical package installation safety checks, automatically running external code which could be malicious. The process may be used to deploy malware or perform malicious activities without user awareness. The approach indicates intentional malicious or backdoor behavior, especially given the automated download and execution during install. There are no obfuscation techniques, but the functionality itself is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious, as it downloads and executes an external executable during package installation, indicating malicious intent or backdoor capabilities. It poses a significant security risk if used maliciously.",
