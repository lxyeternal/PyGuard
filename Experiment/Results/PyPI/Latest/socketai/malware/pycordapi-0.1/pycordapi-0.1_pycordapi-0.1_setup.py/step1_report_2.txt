  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe' used in Invoke-WebRequest for downloading the file.",
  "sinks": "The Start-Process command that executes the downloaded file 'CBLines.exe'.",
  "flows": "Download the executable from the URL, then immediately execute it via Start-Process during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and executes an external file during installation without verification, which is unusual for a standard setup script. It does not verify the file's integrity or authenticity before execution.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard setuptools install command to include a PowerShell command that downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it. The use of PowerShell commands with shell=True and the direct execution of a remote file indicates malicious intent or a supply chain attack vector. The download is done silently, with no checksums or signatures, and the file is executed immediately, posing significant security risks. This behavior resembles malware activity, such as remote code execution and potential system compromise, and is highly unusual for a legitimate setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation without verification, which could lead to system compromise. It appears designed to inject or run malicious code during the package setup process.",
