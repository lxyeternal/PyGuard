{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process to download and execute an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the URL for the executable ('https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe') and the current working directory via os.getcwd().",
  "sinks": "The code executes commands that download a file and then run it, specifically using subprocess.run to execute PowerShell commands to invoke web requests and start processes.",
  "flows": "The source (URL and current directory) flows into PowerShell commands that download the executable, which then flows into execution via Start-Process, potentially running malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes automatic download and execution of an external executable during installation, which is atypical for benign Python packages and indicates possible malicious intent. The use of PowerShell commands to fetch and run external code without validation is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard installation process to include downloading a file from a remote URL and executing it immediately. The download is performed using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest, and the file is then run with Start-Process. This pattern is often associated with malicious activity, such as installing backdoors, malware, or other malicious payloads. The process is hidden within a package setup, making it potentially malicious. No other dependencies or code logic are present that mitigate or justify this behavior, confirming high suspicion of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, as it downloads and executes an external executable during installation without validation or user consent. It appears designed to run arbitrary code from the internet, which poses a significant security risk.",
