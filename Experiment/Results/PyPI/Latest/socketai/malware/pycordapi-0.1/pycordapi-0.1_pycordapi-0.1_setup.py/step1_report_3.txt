{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes an external executable during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the network via PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest to download a file from a specified URL.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded executable is executed using PowerShell Start-Process, which runs the file without validation.",
  "flows": "Input: Download URL from remote server -> Downloaded file saved locally -> Executed via Start-Process",
  "anomalies": "The script downloads an executable during installation and immediately runs it without validation, which is suspicious behavior. No checksums or validation steps are present. The URL used is external and potentially malicious. Use of PowerShell commands to automate download and execution indicates malicious intent or backdoor behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard 'install' command to include a step that downloads a file from a remote URL and executes it automatically during package installation. The download URL points to an executable on GitHub, and the file is launched immediately after download. This behavior is unusual and risky, as it can execute malicious code without user consent or verification. The script does not perform any validation or sandboxing on the downloaded file, increasing security risks. The use of PowerShell commands embedded within Python code for malicious activity is a significant red flag.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an unauthorized, automated download and execution of an external executable during package installation, indicating malicious intent. This behavior constitutes a backdoor or malware delivery mechanism, posing high security risks.",
