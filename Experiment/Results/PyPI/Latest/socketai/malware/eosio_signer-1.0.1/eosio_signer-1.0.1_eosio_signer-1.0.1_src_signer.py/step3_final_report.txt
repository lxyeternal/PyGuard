{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for cryptographic signing operations, including key representation, signing, and verification methods.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or send data to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows; abstract methods are placeholders without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The constructor accepts 'private_str' but does not utilize it; this is not suspicious but may be intended for subclasses.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward abstract base class defining an interface with no executable logic, data leaks, or external interactions. The unused parameter 'private_str' is benign and likely meant for subclasses to handle key data. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface for cryptographic signing with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
