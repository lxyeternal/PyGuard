{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class 'Signer' with methods related to cryptographic signing operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'private_str' in __init__ method, method arguments 'digest', 'encoded_sig'.",
  "sinks": "Methods 'sign' and 'verify' potentially process data, but no direct data sinks or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'private_str' could be used internally in subclasses for signing, 'digest' and 'encoded_sig' are used in 'sign' and 'verify' methods respectively.",
  "anomalies": "The class is purely abstract with no implementation; no hardcoded secrets, no unusual or malicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "This code defines an abstract class with method signatures for cryptographic operations. The constructor accepts an optional private key string but does not use it directly. No external or dangerous calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present in this snippet. It appears to serve as a base for further secure implementations rather than containing malicious code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard abstract class definition for cryptographic signing. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are evident. The presence of a 'private_str' parameter suggests it will be used in subclasses for key management, but nothing malicious is indicated here.",
