  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for cryptographic signing operations",
  "sources": "Initialization of the class with an optional private string parameter",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; class defines interface methods only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and adheres to Python conventions for abstract classes",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'Signer' with an optional private string parameter in the constructor. It declares four abstract methods related to cryptographic signing: to_public, to_wif, sign, and verify. There is no implementation beyond method signatures. No input/output handling, data leakage, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior is present. The class serves as an interface for subclasses to implement specific signing logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard abstract class defining an interface for cryptographic signing functionalities. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
