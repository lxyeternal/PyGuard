{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for a digital signer with methods for key conversion, signing, and verification.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the constructor and method arguments (e.g., private_str, digest, encoded_sig).",
  "sinks": "Method calls such as to_public, to_wif, sign, and verify; no external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Initialization of the class (private_str) may influence subsequent method calls, but no concrete implementation or data flow is provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated code. The class is an abstract base with no executable logic, only method signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'Signer' with an optional private string parameter. All methods are abstract, serving as interface placeholders without implementation. There are no data leaks, external calls, or malicious activities. The code appears to be a standard interface setup, not executing any logic or including malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward abstract class defining a signing interface with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a contract for subclasses to implement cryptographic signing functionalities.",
