{
  "purpose": "To import the EOSIOKey class from a local key module, likely for cryptographic or key management purposes within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module: 'from .key import EOSIOKey'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code imports a class, which could be used later for cryptographic operations or key handling.",
  "flows": "The import brings in EOSIOKey into the namespace; subsequent code may instantiate or use this class, but no data flows are evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present. The code is a standard relative import.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement, which is standard in Python. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The security implications depend entirely on the content of the 'key' module, which is outside the scope of this snippet. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this benign assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a very low risk score (~0.1) to account for potential external module risks. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible, and the scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary based solely on this snippet.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
