  "sources": "Import statement from the current package/module",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None, as it is only an import statement without execution flow or data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed in this single line; it appears to be a straightforward import",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, bringing in a class named EOSIOKey from a local module named key. There are no data inputs, no execution, and no suspicious code or behavior present in this line alone. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign and typical for Python projects.",
