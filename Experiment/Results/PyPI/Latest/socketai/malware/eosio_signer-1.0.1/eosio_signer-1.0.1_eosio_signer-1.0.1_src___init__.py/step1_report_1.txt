  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is a straightforward import statement",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing a class from a local module. There are no input or data reading operations, no untrusted data flows, and no unusual code constructs. It does not exhibit any signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The code by itself does not perform any operations; it merely makes a class available in the current scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase.",
