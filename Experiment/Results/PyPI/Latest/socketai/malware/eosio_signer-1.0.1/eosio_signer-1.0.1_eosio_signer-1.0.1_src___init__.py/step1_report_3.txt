  "sources": "Import statement importing from a local module (.key). No external data input observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no execution or data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as this is only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; potential concern if the imported module contains malicious code, but not evident here.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple relative import statement. It does not perform any data processing or execution by itself. The security concern depends entirely on the content of the 'key' module. The import statement itself is standard and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward import statement with no evident malicious behavior or security issues. The risk depends on the contents of the imported module, which cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
