  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement: `from .key import EOSIOKey`.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data flow issues in this snippet.\n   - The code itself is benign, and the reports' conclusions align with this.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly state that the code is a straightforward import with no malicious behavior.\n   - No factual errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n   - Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Security risk scores are low or zero, which is appropriate.\n   - The only point to consider is report 3, which assigns a securityRisk of 0.2 despite no evidence of risk. This might be a conservative placeholder but could be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is a simple import, there is no justification for a high risk score.\n   - The risk depends on the imported module's content, which is unknown here.\n   - Therefore, all risk scores should remain very low or zero.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malicious activity is indicated.\n   - The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - No reports make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that risk depends on the imported module's content.\n   - The minimal nature of the code prevents any malicious activity from being inferred solely from this snippet.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - Minor adjustments could be made for clarity, such as setting the securityRisk in report 3 to 0.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (more appropriate than 0.2 in report 3)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign import statement with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned are generally appropriate, with a slight adjustment for report 3's securityRisk score.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code snippet and the lack of any suspicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
