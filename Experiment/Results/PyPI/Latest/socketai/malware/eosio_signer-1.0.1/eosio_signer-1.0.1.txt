      "conclusion": "The primary concern with this code is the embedded covert data exfiltration during object instantiation, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The cryptographic functions are standard and not malicious. The network activity to an external IP without user consent indicates a security breach. Therefore, the code should be considered malicious with a malware score of approximately 0.8 and a high security risk score (~0.8-0.9)."
