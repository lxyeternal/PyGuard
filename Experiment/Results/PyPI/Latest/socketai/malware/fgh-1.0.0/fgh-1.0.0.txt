The only noteworthy aspect is the Telegram URL, which does not constitute a security threat in this static context. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low at 0.2."

      "conclusion": "The code is designed to exfiltrate sensitive seed phrases without user consent, using hardcoded credentials and plaintext transmission. This behavior is highly malicious and poses significant security risks. The malware score should be set at 0.9, reflecting high probability of malicious intent, and the overall security risk score should be similarly high at 0.9."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign and straightforward. The risk is minimal, contingent on the implementation of 'a()'. All reports are consistent and appropriately cautious, assigning low malware and obfuscation scores, with a slightly elevated but reasonable risk score of 0.2 due to potential maliciousness of 'a()' if untrusted. No modifications are necessary; the overall security posture is low risk."
