  "purpose": "Import and execute function 'a' from local module 'tonki'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .tonki, calling 'a()'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'a()' which could lead to malicious behavior if 'a()' is malicious.",
  "flows": "Import 'a' from 'tonki' -> call 'a()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and call, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing 'a' from a local module 'tonki' and executing it. No inline malicious code, obfuscation, or external data inputs are present. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'a()' within 'tonki'. All reports correctly identify that the code itself appears benign, with risk scores reflecting uncertainty about 'a()'. Malware scores are consistently zero, indicating no evidence of malicious intent in this snippet. Confidence levels vary but are generally appropriate given the minimal information. The overall assessment is that the code is low risk, with the primary concern being the trustworthiness of 'a()' in 'tonki'.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign and straightforward. The risk is minimal, contingent on the implementation of 'a()'. All reports are consistent and appropriately cautious, assigning low malware and obfuscation scores, with a slightly elevated but reasonable risk score of 0.2 due to potential maliciousness of 'a()' if untrusted. No modifications are necessary; the overall security posture is low risk.",
