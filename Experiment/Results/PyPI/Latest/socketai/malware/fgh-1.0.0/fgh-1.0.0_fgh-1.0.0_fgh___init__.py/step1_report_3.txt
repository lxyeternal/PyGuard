{
  "purpose": "Import and execute a function 'a' from a local module named 'tonki'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'a' from a local module 'tonki'.",
  "sinks": "Function 'a()' execution, which could potentially perform any operation.",
  "flows": "Import of 'a' -> execution of 'a()'.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal and straightforward, no obvious anomalies or hidden code. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'a' from a local module 'tonki' and executes it immediately. Without knowledge of the content of 'tonki.py' and the function 'a', it is impossible to determine if this behavior is malicious. The code itself is simple and does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns. The import and execution pattern is common, but the actual behavior depends on the implementation of 'a'.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple import and execution of a function from a local module. No immediate signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident based solely on this snippet. Further review of the 'tonki' module is needed to fully assess potential risks.",
