{
  "purpose": "Importing and executing a function 'a' from a local module 'tonki'.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .tonki import a, and the call to a()",
  "sinks": "The call to a() could be a sink if 'a' executes untrusted or malicious code.",
  "flows": "Import from local module 'tonki' -> call to function 'a()'",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only imports and executes a function; potential concern if 'a()' is malicious, but no explicit malicious code present here.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function 'a' from a local module 'tonki' and executes it. No inline code, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data inputs are evident. The risk depends entirely on the implementation of 'a()' within 'tonki'. Without the implementation of 'a()', it's impossible to assess whether it contains malicious behavior. The code itself is straightforward and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet by itself does not contain malicious behavior; however, the security risk depends entirely on the contents of the 'a()' function in the 'tonki' module. If 'a()' performs malicious actions, then executing this code could be dangerous. Based solely on this fragment, the risk is low, but the overall security depends on the 'tonki' module's implementation.",
