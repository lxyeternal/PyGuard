  "purpose": "The code imports a function or object 'a' from a module named 'tonki' and then calls it.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement 'from .tonki import a'.",
  "sinks": "The sink is the function call 'a()'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the import of 'a' to its invocation 'a()'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual patterns, and the code is minimal. No apparent malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import and invocation of 'a' from a local module. There are no visible signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, network connections, or execution of untrusted code. Without additional context about the module 'tonki' or the behavior of 'a', there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing a straightforward import and function call without any suspicious behavior. No malware or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
