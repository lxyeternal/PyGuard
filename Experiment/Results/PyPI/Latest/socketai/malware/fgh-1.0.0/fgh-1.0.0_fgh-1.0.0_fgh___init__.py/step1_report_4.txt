  "purpose": "Import and execute a function 'a' from a local module 'tonki'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module.",
  "sinks": "Execution of function 'a' which may contain untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Import 'a' from '.tonki' -> Call 'a()' to execute the function.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; the code simply imports and executes a function with no context or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'a' from a local module named 'tonki' and then immediately calls it. Without additional context, 'a' could contain any code, including malicious logic. The simplicity and lack of safeguards or validation do not inherently indicate malicious intent but pose a risk if 'tonki' or 'a' are malicious. No hardcoded credentials, data leakage, or obfuscation are present. The code's behavior depends entirely on the contents of 'a'.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimalistic, straightforward import and function call. Without the content of 'tonki', it cannot be conclusively deemed malicious; however, executing unknown functions from local modules always carries potential risk. The code itself is not inherently malicious but warrants review of 'tonki'.",
