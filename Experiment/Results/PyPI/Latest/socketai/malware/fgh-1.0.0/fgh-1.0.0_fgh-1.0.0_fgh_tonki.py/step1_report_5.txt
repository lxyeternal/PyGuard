  "purpose": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from user input and sends them as a message via the Telegram Bot API.",
  "sources": "User input from the 'input()' function collecting seed phrases.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to Telegram API endpoint which transmits the seed phrases.",
  "flows": "Input from the user flows into the message string, which then flows into the payload used in the requests.post() call to send data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The seed phrases are directly taken from user input and sent in plain text over the internet. The hardcoded bot token and chat ID are sensitive credentials embedded in the code. No validation or encryption is applied before transmission. The error message contains a typo ('connest', 'pharases') but that is not suspicious, just a minor issue.",
  "analysis": "The code prompts the user to input 12 seed phrases and sends them as plain text to a Telegram chat via a bot. The inclusion of hardcoded credentials (bot token and chat ID) indicates poor security practice. Sending seed phrases over an unencrypted channel (plain HTTP request to Telegram API) in plain text could lead to exposure if intercepted. The code does not attempt to obfuscate or encrypt sensitive data. There are no malicious functions such as data exfiltration to unknown domains, system modification, or backdoors. However, collecting and transmitting seed phrases without encryption or user consent is a serious privacy concern and potentially malicious in intent, depending on context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed to exfiltrate sensitive seed phrases via a Telegram bot, which could be malicious depending on intent. It is suspicious due to the collection of confidential data and transmission of such data without encryption or user awareness. The presence of hardcoded credentials and unencrypted transmission raises security concerns.",
