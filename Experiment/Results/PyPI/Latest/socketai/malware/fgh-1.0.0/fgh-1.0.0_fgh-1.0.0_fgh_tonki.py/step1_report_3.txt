  "purpose": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from the user and sends them as a message via Telegram bot API.",
  "sources": "Input from user via input() function for seed phrases.",
  "sinks": "Requests POST request to Telegram API endpoint with the seed phrases, potentially exposing sensitive data over network.",
  "flows": "User inputs seed phrases -> seed phrases stored in 'secret_words' -> message constructed and sent via requests.post to Telegram API.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, which are sensitive credentials embedded directly in code; no validation or encryption of seed phrases before transmission; use of input() for sensitive data without masking or secure handling.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves 12 seed words from user input, which are sensitive credentials. These are combined into a message string and sent unencrypted via an API request to Telegram, revealing the seed phrases over network. The bot token and chat ID are hardcoded, increasing risk if code is shared or compromised. The function lacks safeguards, encryption, or validation for the seed phrases, indicating a potential security risk. The direct transmission of seed phrases to a third-party service (Telegram) without any obfuscation or user consent highlights malicious intent or severe security negligence.",
  "conclusion": "The code potentially exposes sensitive seed phrases by transmitting them in plain text to a Telegram bot, which constitutes a significant security risk. The presence of hardcoded credentials further exacerbates the threat, suggesting malicious or negligent handling of sensitive data.",
