  "purpose": "Collects 12 seed phrases from user input and sends them via Telegram API using hardcoded credentials.",
  "sources": "User input for seed phrases, hardcoded bot_token and chat_id",
  "sinks": "Telegram API endpoint receiving plaintext seed phrases",
  "flows": "Input() -> seed phrase validation -> message construction -> requests.post to Telegram API",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, transmission of sensitive data in plaintext, no validation or encryption",
  "analysis": "The code prompts for seed phrases, checks count, constructs a message, and sends it unencrypted via Telegram API with embedded credentials. It lacks sanitization, encryption, or user consent mechanisms. The behavior indicates data exfiltration of sensitive seed phrases, which is malicious. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and the security flaws are evident. The transmission of unencrypted seed phrases and hardcoded secrets pose high security risks, aligning with malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to exfiltrate sensitive seed phrases without user consent, using hardcoded credentials and plaintext transmission. This behavior is highly malicious and poses significant security risks. The malware score should be set at 0.9, reflecting high probability of malicious intent, and the overall security risk score should be similarly high at 0.9.",
