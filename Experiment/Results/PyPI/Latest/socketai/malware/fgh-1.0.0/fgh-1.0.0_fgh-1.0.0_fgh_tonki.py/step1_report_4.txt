  "purpose": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from user input and sends them as a message via the Telegram Bot API.",
  "sources": "User input for seed phrases (`input()` function).",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to Telegram API endpoint with the seed phrases as message content.",
  "flows": "User input -> message string -> HTTP POST request to Telegram API with seed phrases.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded bot token and chat ID; input prompts for sensitive seed phrases; no validation or encryption of seed data; direct transmission of seed phrases over network.",
  "analysis": "The code prompts the user to input 12 seed phrases, which are concatenated into a message string. It then sends this message to a specified Telegram chat via the bot API. The bot token and chat ID are hardcoded, making the process easily reproducible and potentially malicious if used for unauthorized disclosure of seed phrases. The use of `input()` to directly collect sensitive data and sending it over the internet without encryption or additional security measures indicates a security risk. No data validation or protection measures are implemented, and the code does not verify the source or purpose of the seed phrases.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed to exfiltrate sensitive seed phrases to a Telegram account, which is malicious behavior. The hardcoded credentials and transmission of private seed data indicate a clear security concern and potential malicious intent.",
