  "conclusion": "The code is designed to exfiltrate sensitive seed phrases without user consent, using hardcoded credentials and plaintext transmission. This behavior is highly malicious and poses significant security risks. The malware score should be set at 0.9, reflecting high probability of malicious intent, and the overall security risk score should be similarly high at 0.9."
