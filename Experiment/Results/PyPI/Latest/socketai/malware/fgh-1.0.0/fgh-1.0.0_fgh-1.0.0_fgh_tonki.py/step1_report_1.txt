  "purpose": "The code prompts the user to input 12 seed phrases for authorization and sends these phrases via Telegram message using a bot.",
  "sources": "User input from input() function for seed phrases",
  "sinks": "Requests to Telegram API endpoint with the secret seed phrases embedded in the message payload",
  "flows": "User provides seed phrases -> seed phrases are concatenated into message -> message is sent via HTTP POST request to Telegram API",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, direct inclusion of user input in message payload without validation or obfuscation, no data sanitization, no secure handling of sensitive data",
  "analysis": "The script collects 12 seed phrases from user input, which are potentially sensitive data. It constructs a message containing these seed phrases and sends it over the network to a Telegram bot API endpoint using hardcoded credentials. The presence of hardcoded credentials (bot token and chat ID) indicates possible abuse if the script is malicious. The code does not sanitize or validate the input beyond checking the count of seed words, and it transmits potentially sensitive information directly over an HTTP request without encryption or obfuscation. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present, but the design facilitates exfiltration of sensitive seed data, which could be malicious in intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed to exfiltrate seed phrases by sending them to a Telegram chat. The hardcoded credentials and direct transmission of sensitive data raise security concerns, suggesting malicious intent or at least risky handling of sensitive information. Overall, this code could be used maliciously to steal seed phrases, indicating a high security risk.",
