  "purpose": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from user input and sends them as a message via Telegram's API.",
  "sources": "Input from the user via the input() function for seed phrases.",
  "sinks": "Requests to the Telegram API endpoint to send messages, which transmits the seed phrases.",
  "flows": "User input -> message concatenation -> POST request to Telegram API with seed phrases.",
  "anomalies": "The code hardcodes a Telegram bot token and chat ID, which could be exploited if leaked. It also directly sends sensitive seed phrases over the network without encryption or additional safeguards. No validation or sanitization of input beyond count check. The token's presence in code poses a security risk.",
  "analysis": "The script takes user input for 12 seed words, verifies the count, and then constructs a message to be sent via Telegram bot API. The presence of a hardcoded bot token and chat ID indicates potential for abuse if the code is malicious or compromised. Sending seed phrases in plaintext over a network, especially to an untrusted endpoint, can lead to theft of sensitive information. The code does not sanitize input or implement security measures like encryption or secure storage. The overall design suggests an intent to exfiltrate seed phrases, which are highly sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates user-provided seed phrases to a Telegram chat, indicating malicious intent. The hardcoded credentials and direct transmission of sensitive data without protection highlight a significant security risk. It appears to be designed for malicious data theft rather than legitimate functionality.",
