  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, static string assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic or untrusted data flows; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual URL pointing to a Telegram link ('https://t.me/pozozal'), which is unconventional for project repositories but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools, with no dynamic code, user input, or network activity. The only atypical element is the URL, which is a static string and not inherently malicious. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning a malware score of 0 and a low security risk score (~0.2) due to the URL. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only noteworthy aspect is the Telegram URL, which does not constitute a security threat in this static context. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low at 0.2.",
