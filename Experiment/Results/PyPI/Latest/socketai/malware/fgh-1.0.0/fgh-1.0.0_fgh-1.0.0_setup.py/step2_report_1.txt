  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the details provided.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` for a Python package, with no dynamic or untrusted input handling.\n- The only unusual element is the `url` pointing to a Telegram link (`https://t.me/pozozal`), which is unconventional for project repositories but not inherently malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks are present.\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the static analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, the code is straightforward and matches the description.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors or mistakes in logic or structure.\n- **Malware or malicious code:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risks:** Very low, primarily due to the URL's nature, but not a direct security risk in this context.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable, considering the unusual URL but no actual malicious activity.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The main concern is the Telegram URL. While unconventional, it does not in itself indicate malicious intent. If this package were distributed widely, the URL could be used for malicious purposes outside the code, but within this static setup script, it remains just a string.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores given are consistent and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed based on the code content.\n- The high confidence (0.9) in the reports is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only unusual aspect is the Telegram URL, which warrants attention from a trust perspective but does not constitute a security threat in this static analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and align with the actual code. No further action or concern is necessary based on this static review.",
