  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports.\n\n**Code Content Review:**\n- The code is a typical `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n- It defines package metadata (`name`, `version`, `author`, etc.).\n- Reads `'README.md'` for the long description.\n- Specifies dependencies (`requests`).\n- Uses a URL pointing to a Telegram link (`https://t.me/pozozal`).\n- No dynamic code, no untrusted input handling, no obfuscated code, no network operations beyond static URL, and no secrets embedded.\n\n**Evaluation of the Reports:**\n\n1. **Purpose & Sources:** All reports correctly identify the code as a standard setup script, with the only anomaly being the Telegram URL.\n2. **Anomalies & Concerns:** The main concern is the URL pointing to Telegram, which is unconventional for project hosting. However, this alone does not imply malicious intent; it could be a placeholder or a link to a communication channel.\n3. **Malware & Security Risks:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code. The security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to the unusual URL, not code behavior.\n4. **Data Flows & Sinks:** No untrusted data flows, no external data inputs, and no dangerous code execution observed.\n5. **Conclusion & Confidence:** All reports agree that the code is benign and standard, with the only note being the suspicious URL.\n\n**Critical Assessment & Recommendations:**\n\n- The code itself is benign. The only potential concern is the URL, which could be used maliciously if it points to malicious content or is used for social engineering.\n- Since the URL is just a string in the setup metadata, it doesn't pose an immediate security risk within this code.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The risk score could be slightly increased if considering the URL's potential misuse, but as per the current context, 0.2 seems reasonable.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\n- The malware score remains at **0** because there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- The obfuscated score remains at **0** because the code is straightforward.\n- The risk score could be maintained at **0.2** due to the unusual URL, but not higher unless further context indicates malicious intent.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                                      |\n|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior present.                              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                 | Clear, straightforward code.                                         |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2               | Slight concern due to the unconventional URL, but no actual risk. |\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a legitimate setup script with an unusual URL. No malicious activity is evident from the code itself.",
