{
  "purpose": "Configure package setup information and dependencies for distribution",
  "sources": "Reads author details, description, long description file, dependencies, and entry points",
  "sinks": "Potentially the entry point 'hhxy=hhxy.main:install_and_run' could execute code in the 'main' module",
  "flows": "User installs the package, which may trigger the 'install_and_run' function in 'main.py' when invoked via console script",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The setup script is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package configuration. It specifies author info, description, dependencies, and an entry point. The 'install_and_run' function in 'main.py' is registered as a console script. No external data sources, unsafe code, or obfuscated elements are present. The code is straightforward, with standard setup patterns. The only point of potential concern is the execution of 'install_and_run' when the console script is invoked, but this is typical behavior for Python CLI packages.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and standard for Python package distribution. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks within this code.",
