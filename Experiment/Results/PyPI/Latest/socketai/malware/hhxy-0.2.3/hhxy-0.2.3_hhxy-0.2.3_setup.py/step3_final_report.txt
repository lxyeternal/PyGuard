  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md, package metadata, dependencies, and defines entry point 'hhxy=hhxy.main:install_and_run'.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of 'install_and_run' function in 'hhxy.main' module via CLI; no direct untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Setup script registers 'install_and_run' as CLI command; actual execution depends on runtime invocation of the function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution present in static analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious indicators. The entry point calls a function that could perform arbitrary actions, but without its implementation, static analysis cannot determine malicious intent. Malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero; security risk is minimal. The code aligns with typical packaging patterns and does not exhibit anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of static malicious indicators. The actual security posture depends on the implementation of 'install_and_run' at runtime, which is outside the scope of this static review. Scores are consistent with the code's content and structure.",
