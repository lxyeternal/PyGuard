{
  "purpose": "Configure the package setup for distribution, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description, importing setuptools modules, and defining package requirements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no user input or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A — setup configuration with static data, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior observed. The code uses standard setup functions and static metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package configuration and calls 'setup()' with static metadata, dependencies, and entry points. The use of 'open' to read README.md is standard. No dynamic code execution, no untrusted data sources, and no malicious constructs are present. The package specifies dependencies and entry points, typical for Python projects. No anomalies or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It properly defines package metadata and dependencies, with no suspicious or harmful behavior detected.",
