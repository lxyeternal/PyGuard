  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'hhxy', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, and README file; defining entry point for console script.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'hhxy.main:install_and_run' as a console command, potentially executing code in that function.",
  "flows": "setup() configuration triggers installation; the entry point 'hhxy' executes 'install_and_run' in 'hhxy.main' module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools to configure package installation. It specifies author info, description, URL, license, package discovery, dependencies, and console entry points. The 'install_and_run' function from 'hhxy.main' is registered as a CLI command. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. All components are standard for Python packaging. The code reads the README.md file, but this is typical and not suspicious. The package dependencies include pandas only. No hardcoded secrets or network connections are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected configuration tasks without any anomalies.",
