      "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of static malicious indicators. The actual security posture depends on the implementation of 'install_and_run' at runtime, which is outside the scope of this static review. Scores are consistent with the code's content and structure."

      "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates minimal security risks with no evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscation suspicion in report 5 is justified, and the scores reflect this appropriately. Minor risk score increase for report 5 from 0.2 to 0.3 could better capture potential concern, but current scores are acceptable. No significant issues or overstatements are present."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code pattern is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity, primarily due to remote code execution without validation. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. Without inspecting the remote script, the risk remains behavioral, but the pattern warrants treating this as a high-risk component in supply chain security."
