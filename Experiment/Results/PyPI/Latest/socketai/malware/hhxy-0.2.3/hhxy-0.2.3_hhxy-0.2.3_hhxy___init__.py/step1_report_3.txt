  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific task within a Python package, possibly related to data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local variables, environment variables, and possibly external inputs like function arguments or standard input.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if present; however, no explicit unsafe sinks are observed in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or function parameters to various processing functions, with no evident untrusted data reaching dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code detected. The code structure appears straightforward with no unusual language features or unnecessary dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "A detailed step-by-step review shows that the code performs standard operations without any indication of malicious intent. It neither collects sensitive information maliciously nor interacts with external malicious domains. Usage of third-party libraries appears benign. No backdoors, hidden behaviors, or malicious payloads are evident. The code maintains clarity and conventional structure, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code injections.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the comprehensive review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate application code with no suspicious elements.",
