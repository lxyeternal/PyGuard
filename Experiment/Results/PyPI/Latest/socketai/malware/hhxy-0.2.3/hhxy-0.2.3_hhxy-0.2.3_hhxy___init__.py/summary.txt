  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates minimal security risks with no evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscation suspicion in report 5 is justified, and the scores reflect this appropriately. Minor risk score increase for report 5 from 0.2 to 0.3 could better capture potential concern, but current scores are acceptable. No significant issues or overstatements are present."
