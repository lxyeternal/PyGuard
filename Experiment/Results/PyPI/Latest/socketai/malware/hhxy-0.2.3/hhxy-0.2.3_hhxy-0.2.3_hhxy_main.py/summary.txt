  "conclusion": "The code pattern is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity, primarily due to remote code execution without validation. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. Without inspecting the remote script, the risk remains behavioral, but the pattern warrants treating this as a high-risk component in supply chain security."
