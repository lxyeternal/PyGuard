{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a Pyarmor runtime wrapper for license enforcement and anti-tampering, utilizing heavy obfuscation and encrypted data to protect the script.",
  "sources": "Import from '.pyarmor_runtime_000000' and the call to '__pyarmor__' with a large encrypted binary blob.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file modifications, or environment variable access are present; the code only invokes a function with encrypted data.",
  "flows": "Import module -> call '__pyarmor__' with module name, filename, and encrypted data blob.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation and encrypted binary data are present, but this is typical for license enforcement tools like Pyarmor; no suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Pyarmor protection wrapper, heavily obfuscated with encrypted data, designed to prevent reverse engineering or tampering. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are visible. The high obfuscation score (around 0.9) is justified by the encrypted blob. Malware activity is absent, with a very low malware score (~0.1). The overall security risk is low (~0.2), as the code's purpose is protection, not malicious behavior. The confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Pyarmor runtime component used for licensing and anti-tampering, not malicious. The heavy obfuscation and encrypted data are consistent with legitimate protection mechanisms. Scores are appropriate, and no active malicious activity is detected.",
