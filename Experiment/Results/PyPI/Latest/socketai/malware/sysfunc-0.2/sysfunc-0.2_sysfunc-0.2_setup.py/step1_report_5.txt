  "purpose": "This setup.py script is used to configure and install a Python package named 'sysfunc' which interacts with system functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration data such as package name, version, packages, description, author, Python version requirement, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code; the script only defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the flow is limited to package configuration data within the script.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs; all code serves standard package setup purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious behavior is present. The author field contains a seemingly benign string. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py file is a legitimate package configuration script with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines the package metadata for distribution.",
