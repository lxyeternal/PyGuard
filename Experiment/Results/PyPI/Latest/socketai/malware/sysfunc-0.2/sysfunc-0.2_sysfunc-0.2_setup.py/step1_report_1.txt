{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script is used to configure and install the 'sysfunc' Python package, which is described as a library for interacting with system functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata such as name, version, packages, description, author, python_requires, and classifiers from hardcoded values.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data is sent externally; the script only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the setup process uses predefined static values only.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It defines package metadata and dependencies without any dynamic execution, user input, or external data handling. The code structure is typical and adheres to common practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script appears to be a benign, standard package configuration file with no indications of malicious intent or security concerns.",
