{
  "purpose": "Standard package configuration for a Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields such as name, version, description, author, classifiers, and the use of find_packages().",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static metadata remains internal.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, uses find_packages() for package discovery, and specifies metadata such as name, version, author, and classifiers. The script is static, with no dynamic code, user input, external data, or network operations. The author field 'Hosne432' appears as a username or identifier, which is common in open-source projects. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code’s simplicity and adherence to standard practices confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
