{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ attribute from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for runtime obfuscation or licensing enforcement.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.pyarmor_runtime'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output, network connection, or data processing observed",
  "flows": "Import statement loads the module, no data flow to external systems or user input",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates trial version and expiration date; no suspicious or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single attribute from a module within the package. The comment suggests it's part of a packaging or obfuscation tool (Pyarmor). There are no indications of data leakage, network activity, or malicious behavior. The code is minimal and appears legitimate for a protected or obfuscated Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement associated with a runtime obfuscation tool. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
