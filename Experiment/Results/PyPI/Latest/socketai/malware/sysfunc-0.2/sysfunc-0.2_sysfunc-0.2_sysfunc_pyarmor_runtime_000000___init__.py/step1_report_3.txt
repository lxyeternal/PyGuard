{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ attribute from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for runtime protection or licensing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from source to sink; only a module import",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating trial version and license info; no malicious indicators, but the presence of license and trial info may suggest obfuscation or licensing enforcement",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment line and an import statement for a module named pyarmor_runtime. The comment indicates this is a trial version of Pyarmor 9.0.6, which is a tool used for code obfuscation and licensing. The import is straightforward, importing a special attribute __pyarmor__ from the module. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The comment about the trial version does not imply malicious intent but suggests licensing enforcement or obfuscation practices. Overall, the code appears benign and standard for licensing or runtime protection.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with a license comment; no malicious activity or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a licensing or obfuscation mechanism without any malicious intent.",
