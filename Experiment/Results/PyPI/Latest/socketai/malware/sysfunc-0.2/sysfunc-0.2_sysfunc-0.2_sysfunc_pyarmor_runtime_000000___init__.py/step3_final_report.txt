{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for licensing or obfuscation purposes in a protected Python script.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime or pyarmor_runtime module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports a module without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of comments indicating Pyarmor version, trial status, and timestamps; no malicious or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement associated with Pyarmor licensing or obfuscation. No malicious activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior is evident. The comments are standard licensing info. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is minimal (score ~0.1-0.2), and security risk is very low (~0.1). The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or flaws are detected, and the code aligns with typical protected scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, related to licensing or obfuscation with Pyarmor, and poses no security threat. The provided reports are accurate, and their scoring appropriately reflects the low risk. No adjustments or further analysis are necessary.",
