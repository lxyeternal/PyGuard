{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or protection purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing or output occurs",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code only imports a module",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a comment indicating it is related to Pyarmor 9.0.6 trial version and a timestamp, which is unusual in production code but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement from a relative module named pyarmor_runtime, with an associated comment mentioning a specific version and a timestamp. The import alone is typical for including obfuscation or licensing components. No code execution, data handling, or suspicious activity is present. The presence of a comment referencing a trial version could suggest licensing enforcement but does not indicate malicious intent. The minimal nature of the code and its direct import do not show signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement related to Pyarmor's runtime environment, likely used for code obfuscation or licensing. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
