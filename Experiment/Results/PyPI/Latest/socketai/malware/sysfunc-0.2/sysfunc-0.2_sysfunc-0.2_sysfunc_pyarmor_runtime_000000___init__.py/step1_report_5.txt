{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or protection purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package: from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or external outputs; the code simply imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicates a trial version of Pyarmor with a timestamp, which suggests licensing info. No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named __pyarmor__ from a relative package, indicating usage of Pyarmor for code protection. The comment references the Pyarmor version, a trial license, and a timestamp. There are no dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, network calls, or other suspicious activities. The minimal nature of the code suggests it is a standard obfuscation/packaging mechanism rather than malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward import statement associated with Pyarmor obfuscation, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The presence of a trial license comment is standard and not suspicious.",
