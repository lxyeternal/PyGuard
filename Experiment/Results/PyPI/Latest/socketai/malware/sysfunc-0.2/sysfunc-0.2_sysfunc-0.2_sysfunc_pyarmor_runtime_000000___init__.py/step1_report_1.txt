{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ object from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely used for runtime protection or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; import statement does not process external data",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates this is related to Pyarmor trial version, which is used for obfuscation or licensing. No unusual or suspicious code behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of an import statement and a comment. It does not contain any data handling, external communication, or obfuscated malicious code. The presence of a version and trial info does not inherently suggest malicious intent, only licensing details. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, and no obfuscation detected beyond standard comment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement related to Pyarmor licensing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be part of a protected or obfuscated script using Pyarmor.",
