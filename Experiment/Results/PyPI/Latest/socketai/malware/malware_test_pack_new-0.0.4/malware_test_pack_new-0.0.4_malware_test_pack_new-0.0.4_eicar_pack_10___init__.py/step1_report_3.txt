{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'file_download' from a local module 'eic_py_'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'eic_py_' to import 'file_download'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is processed or outputted in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A - Only an import statement; no data flow or execution flow beyond module import.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'eic_py_' is unusual and could be a placeholder or obfuscation, but no malicious activity can be inferred from this alone.",
  "analysis": "This snippet only performs a module import from a local file, which is common in Python projects. The module name 'eic_py_' is somewhat atypical, but without additional context or code, it cannot be deemed malicious. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The import alone does not present a security risk. Since no actual implementation or runtime behavior is shown, the security assessment is limited to the import statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. The unusual module name warrants further review of the 'eic_py_' module to confirm its safety, but based solely on this snippet, it appears benign.",
