{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'file_download' from a local module 'eic_py_' to facilitate file download operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module; 'file_download' function (potentially external or internally defined).",
  "sinks": "Potentially the 'file_download' function if it performs network operations or file writing based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Code imports 'file_download'; any subsequent use of this function could process untrusted data leading to network or file system actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a relative import with a non-descriptive module name 'eic_py_' which could be obfuscated or suspicious. No explicit usage of 'file_download' shown, limiting context.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a function from a local module, with no further logic or data handling shown. The import path and function name suggest file download capability, but without implementation details, the risk is unclear. The module name 'eic_py_' could be intentionally obfuscated or simply a naming choice. No signs of malicious behavior are evident from this snippet alone, but the potential for network or file system operations exists if 'file_download' is used maliciously elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet alone is not malicious but indicates potential for file downloading operations. No malicious activity can be confirmed without additional context or usage of 'file_download'.",
