{
  "purpose": "Import a function 'file_download' from a local module 'eic_py_'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this code snippet; it's only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual module name 'eic_py_' with trailing underscore; relative import syntax '.eic_py_'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no execution or data flow. The module name is non-standard, which could suggest obfuscation or a placeholder, but no malicious activity is evident. The 'file_download' function's behavior is unknown; it could be benign or malicious depending on its implementation and usage. The scores reflect low suspicion: malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate due to naming, and risk is minimal. Without further context, the code appears benign, but the module name warrants caution if additional code is provided.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with an unusual module name. No evidence of malicious activity or malicious intent is present. The scores are appropriate given the limited context, but further investigation of the 'eic_py_' module and 'file_download' implementation is recommended if more code becomes available.",
