  "purpose": "Importing the 'file_download' function from a local module named 'eic_py_'",
  "sources": "No data input sources are evident in this single line",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are evident in this line",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from this single import statement",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'eic_py_' is unusual due to the trailing underscore, which could suggest obfuscation or attempt to evade detection. No other anomalies are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a specific function from a local module. Without additional context, it's impossible to determine what 'file_download' does or how it might be used. There is no indication of malicious behavior solely from this import statement. The module name's unusual syntax warrants note but does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The unusual module name is noted but not suspicious enough to flag as malicious without further code context.",
