{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'file_download' from a module '.eic_py_'. The purpose appears to be related to downloading files, but the specific intent cannot be determined from this single import statement alone.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which references a local module '.eic_py_'. No external data input or user input is visible in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks in this snippet; however, if 'file_download' is used later, it could potentially write or download files. The import itself does not pose a security risk.",
  "flows": "No execution flow or data flow is evident from this snippet alone; it only shows a module import.",
  "anomalies": "The module name '.eic_py_' is unusual due to its leading dot, which indicates a relative import. The name itself is not suspicious but could be used to obfuscate or hide the origin of the code. There is no evidence of obfuscation or malicious behavior here.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a relative module. No inputs, outputs, or behaviors can be assessed beyond the fact that it brings in 'file_download' from a local module. Without additional context or code, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal import statement with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports a function, and further analysis would require examining the 'file_download' implementation or additional code.",
