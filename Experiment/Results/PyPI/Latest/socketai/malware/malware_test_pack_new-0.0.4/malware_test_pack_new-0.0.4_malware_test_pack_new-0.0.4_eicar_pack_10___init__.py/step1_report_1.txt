{
  "purpose": "Importing a function named 'file_download' from a local module 'eic_py_'",
  "sources": "Module import statement; specifically, the 'file_download' function in the local package",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external communication shown",
  "flows": "No data flows observed; only an import statement without execution or data handling",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'eic_py_' is unusual and potentially obfuscated or non-standard; no other code present",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing 'file_download' from a local module 'eic_py_'. There are no further operations, data handling, or network activities. The module name is somewhat suspicious due to its non-standard naming, which could suggest obfuscation or a hidden purpose. However, with only this line, no malicious activity can be confirmed. The presence of only an import statement indicates that this is a fragment, and without additional context or usage, no malicious intent can be determined.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a straightforward import statement with no evident malicious behavior. The unusual module name warrants caution, but on its own, it does not indicate malware or security risks.",
