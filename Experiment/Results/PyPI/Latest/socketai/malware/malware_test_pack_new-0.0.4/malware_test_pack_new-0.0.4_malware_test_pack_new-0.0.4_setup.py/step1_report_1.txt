  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package intended for testing application security tools and security software.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file; specifying package data including 'eicar.com'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points where untrusted data flows to potentially dangerous actions; no network or system modification code.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flow; the code only defines package metadata and data inclusion.",
  "anomalies": "The long_description explicitly states that the package downloads a 'malware file that isn't malicious', which suggests an intent to test detection tools; the package data includes 'eicar.com', a known test malware signature used in security testing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and reads the README file to include as a long description. The package metadata indicates it's a test package designed to include a file named 'eicar.com', a well-known test signature for antivirus testing. The code itself contains no network operations, payloads, or dynamic code execution. The explicit mention of downloading a 'malware file' for testing purposes, combined with the inclusion of the EICAR test file, indicates the package's purpose is for security testing rather than malicious intent. The setup script does not contain any suspicious code or backdoors, and the overall implementation is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for a testing package that intentionally includes a known test malware file ('eicar.com') for security tool testing purposes. There is no malicious behavior or harmful code present; the package's purpose is explicitly to facilitate security testing.",
