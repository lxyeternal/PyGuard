{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'malware_test_pack_new' intended for testing application security tools.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; no untrusted input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "None. The setup script does not process or execute untrusted data; it only defines package metadata and configuration.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The package includes a data file named 'eicar.com' within the package data. The EICAR test file is a standard antivirus test file, not malicious by itself, but its inclusion suggests an intent to deploy or test malware detection tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, importing setuptools, reading the README, and configuring package metadata. The only unusual aspect is the inclusion of 'eicar.com' as package data. The description states it is a non-malicious file used for testing security tools, aligning with the use of EICAR test files in security testing environments. No code performs malicious actions, no dynamic code execution, and no insecure handling of data is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign setup configuration intended for testing security systems with a known non-malicious test file (EICAR). Despite the package's naming and description implying malware testing, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise within this code. The inclusion of 'eicar.com' is consistent with testing scenarios and not inherently malicious.",
