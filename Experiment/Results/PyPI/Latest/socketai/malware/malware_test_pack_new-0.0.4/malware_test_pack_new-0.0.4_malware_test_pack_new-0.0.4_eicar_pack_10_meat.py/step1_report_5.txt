  "purpose": "Send a simple message 'Hello' to a specified Discord webhook URL",
  "sources": "Webhook URL hardcoded in the variable 'webhook_url'; JSON payload defined in 'payload'",
  "sinks": "requests.post() call which sends data to the webhook URL",
  "flows": "payload data from 'payload' variable to requests.post(), which transmits data to the webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL; no user input handling; no obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code; no data exfiltration or malicious commands",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a static payload with the message 'Hello' and sends it to a fixed Discord webhook URL. It uses the 'requests' library to perform an HTTP POST request with JSON data. The webhook URL is hardcoded and publicly visible, which could be considered a security concern if sensitive. However, the code itself does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, command execution, or system modifications. It simply posts a message to a specified webhook. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation is detected. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a simple, benign implementation to send a message to a Discord webhook. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is the hardcoded webhook URL, which if exposed or misused, could send unwanted messages or spam.",
