{
  "purpose": "Send a static message 'Hello' to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads the webhook URL and constructs a static payload.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post() function sends data to the webhook URL, which could be exploited if the URL is exposed.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining the webhook URL and payload, to executing requests.post() to send the message.",
  "anomalies": "The webhook URL is hardcoded, which is a security concern but not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing standard libraries, defining a static webhook URL and payload, then sending the message via requests.post(). No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network anomalies are present. The only notable issue is the exposure risk of the webhook URL. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (~0.2). The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores are consistent and justified given the simplicity and purpose of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign script for sending a message to a Discord webhook. The primary concern is the exposure of the webhook URL, which could be misused if leaked, but this does not constitute malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the exposure risk. Overall, the code is safe and non-malicious.",
