  "purpose": "Download a file from a specified URL and open it locally.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlretrieve(self.url, self.filename) reads data from the provided URL.",
  "sinks": "os.startfile(self.filename) executes the downloaded file, opening it on the system.",
  "flows": "The code downloads content from the URL (source) and then opens the saved file (sink), allowing execution.",
  "anomalies": "The default URL points to a Python script hosted on GitHub, which is automatically downloaded and opened; this could be potentially malicious if the source is untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches a file from a remote URL and immediately opens it, which could execute malicious code if the URL points to malicious content. The URL is hardcoded with a specific address. Using os.startfile opens the file without validation, posing a risk if the downloaded file is malicious. No input validation or user consent is involved, and the script does not verify the content before opening. This behavior is risky as it automates potentially harmful downloads and execution.",
  "conclusion": "The script downloads and executes a remote file without validation, which could lead to executing malicious code if the URL points to harmful content. This pattern indicates a significant security risk, especially if the URL is not controlled or verified.",
