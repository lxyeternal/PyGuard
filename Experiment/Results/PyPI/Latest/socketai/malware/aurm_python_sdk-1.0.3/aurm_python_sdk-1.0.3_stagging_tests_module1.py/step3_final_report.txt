  "purpose": "A simple Python module defining a function that returns a static greeting string, intended for testing or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "The function 'test_function' returning a static string; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function simply returns a constant string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static function with no inputs, outputs, dependencies, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code poses no threat and is suitable for use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no malicious behavior or security issues. The reports are accurate and the scores justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
