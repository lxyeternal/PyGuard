  "flows": "Import statement flows directly into namespace export without processing or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package initialization file that imports a function and defines __all__ for exports. There are no signs of malicious intent, no data leaks, no external network activity, and no suspicious behavior. It is a typical __init__.py file used to manage namespace exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
