  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing test_function from module1 and exposing it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .module1 import test_function",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved",
  "flows": "Import source to __all__ declaration; no data flow beyond standard import",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export statements, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file that imports a function from a sibling module and exposes it via __all__. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or network activity are present. The code structure is typical for Python package initialization, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and clarity support the conclusion that it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
