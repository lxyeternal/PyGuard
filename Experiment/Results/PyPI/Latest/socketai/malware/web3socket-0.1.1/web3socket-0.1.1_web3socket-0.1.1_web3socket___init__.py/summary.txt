  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a severe security risk due to fetching and executing remote code without validation, constituting a high potential for malicious activity. The pattern is a classic supply chain vulnerability, and the scores should reflect maximum malware and security risk levels. The code itself is not obfuscated, but its behavior is inherently dangerous and exploitable for malicious purposes."
