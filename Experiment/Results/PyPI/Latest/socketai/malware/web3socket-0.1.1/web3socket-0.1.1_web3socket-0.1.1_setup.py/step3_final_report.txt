  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python project, extracting version info from source, and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from 'web3socket/__init__.py' using regex.",
  "sinks": "Passes configuration data to setup(), no untrusted data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads version from file, passes to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to extract version, which is common but could be manipulated if the source file is compromised; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard Python setup script. It imports setup functions, reads version info via regex, and calls setup() with package details. No network activity, code injection, or suspicious patterns are present. The regex-based version extraction is typical but could be a minor vector if the source file is tampered with; however, this does not constitute malicious behavior. The code does not obfuscate or execute untrusted code. The malware score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal concern about version string parsing. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no signs of supply chain attack, malware, or malicious intent. The minor risk score accounts for the regex version extraction but does not indicate any security threat.",
