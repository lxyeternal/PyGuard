{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'web3socket', used to distribute and install the package with its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the version string from 'web3socket/__init__.py' using a regex search.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is written or executed directly from input sources.",
  "flows": "The version string read from the file is used directly in the setup() call without further processing, but it is not used in an unsafe context.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to parse the version string from a file is standard; no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to read the package version from a file and assert that it exists, then proceeds with setup configuration. The version extraction uses regex on a static file, which is typical for setup scripts. No code injection, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The code handles dependencies and package data normally. No anomalies or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical Python setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any unsafe operations, network communication, or contain hidden backdoors. It is safe to use.",
