{
  "purpose": "To set up and package the web3socket Python project, including extracting version info and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ variable from 'web3socket/__init__.py'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; setup() function handles installation parameters without executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from file → uses setup() for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to extract version info directly from source file, which is common but can be unsafe if the file content is manipulated. No other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and attempts to import setuptools for packaging. It extracts the version string using regex from the '__init__.py' file, which is a typical approach. The setup() function specifies package data, dependencies, and metadata without executing any untrusted code or including malicious instructions. No code injections, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and appears to serve only packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It safely reads version info and defines package parameters without executing external or untrusted code. No malicious behavior or malware signals are detected.",
