  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the script is a standard setup.py, extracting version info via regex from a source file, with no malicious code or suspicious behavior. The confidence is high (0.9), and the malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The code is benign, and the report's conclusions are accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms the script's purpose as a package setup, with no malicious activity. The version extraction via regex is standard. The confidence is 0.9, and malware is 0.\n- **Verdict:** No concerns. The analysis is sound.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior. The process of reading version info and passing it to setup() is straightforward. The confidence and malware scores are consistent.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard setup script, no suspicious activity, malware score of 0.\n- **Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, confirming the script's benign nature. The use of regex for version extraction is common, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Code presence:** The code in all reports matches the original code snippet.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; only the regex-based version extraction, which is standard.\n\n### Final Security Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the lack of malicious activity, a risk score of around 0.1 is appropriate, reflecting minimal concern due to the regex operation but nothing malicious.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The only minor concern is the use of regex to parse version info, which could be malformed if the source file is tampered with, but this is a common pattern and not inherently risky.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack, backdoors, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the minor potential for version string manipulation but no actual risk)\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis or detailed scoring adjustments are needed.",
