{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to configure and set up the web3socket Python package, including reading the version information from the package's __init__.py file and passing metadata to the setup() function.",
  "sources": "Reading the version string from 'web3socket/__init__.py' via regex and package data inclusion.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function, which processes package metadata; the open() function used to read the version file.",
  "flows": "open() reads the version info, then the regex extracts the version string, which is used as input to setup(), a standard package configuration process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or malicious code, no network activity, and no suspicious file operations beyond standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup routine for a Python package, extracting version info dynamically from the package's __init__.py file. It uses regex for extraction, which is common in such scripts. The setup() call includes package metadata and dependencies, all standard. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code relies on standard library functions and conventional package setup procedures, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It securely reads version info and prepares package metadata for distribution. No security concerns are identified.",
