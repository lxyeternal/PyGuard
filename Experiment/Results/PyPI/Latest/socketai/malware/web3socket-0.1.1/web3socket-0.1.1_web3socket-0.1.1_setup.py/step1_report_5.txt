{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'web3socket' by extracting its version from an init file and configuring package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string from 'web3socket/__init__.py'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setuptools' or 'distutils' for package setup; does not perform any data output, network operations, or handle untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from file -> passes data to setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable operation is extracting version info via regex from a file. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscation or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on package setup. It conditionally imports setup functions, extracts version info via regex, and calls setup() with package metadata. The regex operation reads a version string from a file without executing code or processing untrusted input. No external data inputs, network connections, or insecure code constructs are present. The script appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. The code is straightforward and performs expected setup tasks.",
