{
  "purpose": "The script sets up the package metadata and configuration for the 'web3socket' Python package, including version extraction and dependency declaration.",
  "sources": "Reading the version string from 'web3socket/__init__.py' file",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; setup parameters are static or derived from local files",
  "flows": "Extracts version from local file, then runs setup with static parameters",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a regex to parse version info from a file, which is standard but could be malformed if the file content is unexpected; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are present",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical package setup process: it imports setup functions, attempts to read the package version from a specific file using regex, and then calls setup() with predefined parameters. No user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. The version extraction method is straightforward and not obfuscated. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It responsibly retrieves version information and declares dependencies, with no signs of security risks.",
