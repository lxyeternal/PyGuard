  "purpose": "Start a Flash Policy Server for WebSocket connections to allow cross-domain access.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module and initializing FlashPolicyServer instance; calling server.start() and server.serve_forever()",
  "sinks": "Server methods that listen and serve network connections, potentially exposing a policy file to clients",
  "flows": "Initialization of server object -> server.start() -> server.serve_forever()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data; reliance on third-party web3socket.policyserver without evidence of malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a WebSocket policy server to handle cross-domain requests, which is typical in WebSocket deployments. It outputs server info to stderr. No input is read from untrusted sources, and the server's start and serve functions are standard. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The server’s purpose is benign, related to WebSocket security policies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup for a WebSocket flash policy server with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It simply initializes and runs a server, with no indications of malicious activity or data leakage.",
