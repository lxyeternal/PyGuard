  "purpose": "To start a Flash Policy Server for WebSocket security policy delivery.",
  "sources": "Importing web3socket.policyserver and initializing FlashPolicyServer, which internally reads configuration and network parameters.",
  "sinks": "server.start() and server.serve_forever() - network socket binding and listening; printing to standard error.",
  "flows": "Initialization of the server object (source) leading to binding and listening on network ports (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data; usage appears standard for setting up a policy server.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a server class from a third-party library (web3socket.policyserver), initializes a FlashPolicyServer object with noisy logging enabled, starts the server, and then enters a blocking serve_forever loop. The code includes a print statement to stderr indicating the listening address. There are no apparent code injections, backdoors, or suspicious network connections beyond the standard policy server setup. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or unusual code structures. It simply sets up and runs a network service related to WebSocket security policy management.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions to launch a WebSocket security policy server. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data flows, or security risks in this code snippet. It appears to be a standard setup for a WebSocket policy server, with no indications of malicious intent.",
