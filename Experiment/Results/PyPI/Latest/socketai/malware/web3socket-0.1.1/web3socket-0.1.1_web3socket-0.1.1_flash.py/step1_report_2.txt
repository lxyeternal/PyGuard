{
  "purpose": "Starts a Flash policy server for WebSocket communication, enabling cross-domain policy requests.",
  "sources": "Importing sys and FlashPolicyServer from web3socket.policyserver; server.start() and server.serve_forever() methods.",
  "sinks": "Printing to standard error; potentially listening on network ports (server_host and server_port).",
  "flows": "Initialization of the server object, starting the server, and logging server details; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors detected. The code simply initializes and runs a network policy server.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and initiates a FlashPolicyServer instance, which by default provides cross-domain policy for WebSocket clients. It logs server details to stderr and runs the server indefinitely. No data manipulation, user input handling, or external communication beyond server startup is evident. The code appears to be a straightforward server setup for WebSocket cross-domain policy, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign server initialization script for WebSocket security policies. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, data theft, or harmful actions. It appears to be a standard utility for enabling cross-origin WebSocket connections.",
