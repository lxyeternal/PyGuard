  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward server initialization for a FlashPolicyServer related to WebSocket or Flash cross-domain policies.\n- No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code is not obfuscated, and the malware scores are consistently zero.\n- The purpose is benign: serving cross-domain policy files or WebSocket security policies.\n- The reports' confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present in the code:\n\n- **Issue presence:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident in the code snippets.\n- **Logical flaws:** The code is simple and standard for starting such servers; no flaws are apparent.\n- **Potential risks:** The only minor concern could be the server listening on open ports, but this is typical for such services and not inherently risky.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is standard server setup.\n- They emphasize the absence of suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n- They do not overstate or assume vulnerabilities beyond what the code demonstrates.\n- **No significant errors** are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal risk, which seems reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- Given the code's purpose and the lack of suspicious activity, higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal risk, typical for server setup scripts.\n\n**Additional comments:**\n\n- The code does not perform any external data processing, user input handling, or network interactions beyond starting a server.\n- The server's purpose is benign and standard for enabling cross-domain WebSocket or Flash client connections.\n- No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimated Score |\n|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                     |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1 – 0.2             |\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No further action or concern is warranted based on this review.",
