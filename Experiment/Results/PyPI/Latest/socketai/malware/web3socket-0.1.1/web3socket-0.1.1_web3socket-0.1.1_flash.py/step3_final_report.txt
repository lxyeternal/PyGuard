{
  "purpose": "Initialize and run a FlashPolicyServer to serve cross-domain policy files for WebSocket or Flash clients.",
  "sources": "Importing the web3socket.policyserver module, creating a FlashPolicyServer instance, and calling start() and serve_forever() methods.",
  "sinks": "The server binds to network ports and listens indefinitely; no untrusted data input or external data processing is evident.",
  "flows": "Server initialization -> server.start() -> server.serve_forever() -> network socket listening.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward server setup script for serving cross-domain policy files. It imports a module, initializes a server object, starts it, and runs indefinitely. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling are present. The server's purpose is benign, and the code structure is standard. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature and network exposure of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a WebSocket/Flash cross-domain policy server with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
