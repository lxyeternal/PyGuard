{
  "purpose": "The script starts a Flash Policy Server, which is used to serve cross-domain policy files for Flash applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads the sys and web3socket.policyserver modules. It initializes the FlashPolicyServer object.",
  "sinks": "The server.start() and server.serve_forever() methods, which keep the server running and listening for incoming connections.",
  "flows": "The code initializes the server object, then starts the server to listen indefinitely, with no external input influencing the flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The code only starts a policy server without external data processing.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, initializes a FlashPolicyServer instance with 'noisy=True', starts the server, and logs the server address to standard error. The server runs indefinitely, serving cross-domain policy files for Flash applications. No user input, untrusted data, or network interactions are directly handled within this code snippet. The server's purpose is benign and typical for Flash-based applications requiring cross-domain permissions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation to run a Flash policy server, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code patterns. The server's purpose is standard for supporting Flash clients.",
