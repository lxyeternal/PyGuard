{
  "purpose": "Serve a permissive cross-domain policy XML to clients connecting on port 843, allowing access from all domains and ports.",
  "sources": "No dynamic input; static XML policy sent upon connection in handle() method.",
  "sinks": "socket.sendall() transmits the static policy XML; no untrusted data processed.",
  "flows": "Connection accepted -> handle() invoked -> socket.sendall(policy XML) -> client receives policy.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. The print statement uses Python 2 syntax, but this is unrelated to security concerns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Flash cross-domain policy server. It listens on port 843 and sends a static, permissive XML policy allowing all domains and ports. No input processing, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The server's purpose is benign, serving a common policy XML. The security implications are primarily due to the permissiveness of the policy, not the code itself. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) reflects the permissive policy but aligns with the benign code. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a Flash cross-domain policy server. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified by the permissive policy, which could be a concern if misused but is typical for such servers. Overall, the code is safe, and the reports are accurate.",
