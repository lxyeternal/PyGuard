  "purpose": "Serve a cross-domain policy XML to clients connecting on port 843 for Flash applications.",
  "sources": "Incoming socket connections on port 843, via handle method",
  "sinks": "socket.sendall(self.policy) - sending XML policy data to clients",
  "flows": "Socket connection accepted -> handle method invoked -> policy XML sent to socket",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; straightforward functionality",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of StreamServer to serve a static cross-domain policy XML for Flash clients. It accepts incoming connections on port 843, optionally logs connections, and responds with a fixed XML policy. The implementation appears standard for such a server, with no signs of malicious behavior or hidden code. No external data sources or sensitive information handling observed. The policy XML is static and does not include dynamic or suspicious content. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a simple cross-domain policy server for Flash clients with no malicious intent or security concerns. It performs a legitimate function with standard implementation, no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
