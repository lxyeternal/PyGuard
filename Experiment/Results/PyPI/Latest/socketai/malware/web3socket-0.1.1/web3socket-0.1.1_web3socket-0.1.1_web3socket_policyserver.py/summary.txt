  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a Flash cross-domain policy server. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified by the permissive policy, which could be a concern if misused but is typical for such servers. Overall, the code is safe, and the reports are accurate."
