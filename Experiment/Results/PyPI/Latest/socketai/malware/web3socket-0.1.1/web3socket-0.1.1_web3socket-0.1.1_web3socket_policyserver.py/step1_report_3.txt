{
  "purpose": "Serve a cross-domain policy file for Flash clients to allow cross-origin access on port 843.",
  "sources": "The `handle` method reads incoming socket connections and potentially the `listener` address, but does not process input data from clients.",
  "sinks": "The `socket.sendall(self.policy)` sends the policy XML to clients; no untrusted data is used here.",
  "flows": "Incoming socket connection -> `handle` method -> sending fixed policy data to socket.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Usage of a fixed policy file and standard socket operations.",
  "analysis": "The class extends `StreamServer` to serve a fixed XML cross-domain policy to clients connecting on port 843, typical for Flash cross-origin policies. The code correctly sets default listener to listen on all interfaces at port 843. The `handle` method optionally logs connections and then sends the static policy string. There is no processing of client input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity or data leaks. The code appears straightforward and intended solely to provide a cross-origin policy for Flash applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a Flash cross-domain policy server. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It only serves a static policy file upon connection, with no data processing or suspicious operations.",
