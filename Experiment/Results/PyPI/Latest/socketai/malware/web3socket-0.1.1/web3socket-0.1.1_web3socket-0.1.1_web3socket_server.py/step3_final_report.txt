{
  "purpose": "Implements a WebSocket server with static file serving, policy server, and logging functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, request paths, and files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Writes to stderr, logs messages, and sends HTTP responses including static files.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and request paths flow into server logic; static files are read and responses are sent; logs and error messages are generated.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling (`except:`), reliance on environment variables without validation, dynamic file access with minimal validation, use of deprecated syntax (`except Exception, ex`).",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard server functions with static file serving, WebSocket handling, and optional policy server management. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. The broad exception handling and dynamic file access could pose security concerns but are mitigated by filename sanitization (`basename`) and standard server practices. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The logs could leak internal details, but this is typical for debugging and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a WebSocket and static file server with appropriate exception handling and logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low malware score (0) and low security risk score (0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
