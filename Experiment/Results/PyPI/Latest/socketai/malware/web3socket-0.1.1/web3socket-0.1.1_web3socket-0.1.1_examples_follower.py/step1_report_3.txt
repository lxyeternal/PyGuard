{
  "purpose": "A web application handling websocket connections and serving static files with periodic message updates to connected clients.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, socket methods (getpeername, receive, send), file I/O for serving static files.",
  "sinks": "Socket.send() method, file open/read operations, printing traceback and errors.",
  "flows": "Environment data (socket info) to socket.send, file path to open/read, exceptions to traceback and print, periodic message creation to socket.send.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network connections; no obfuscated code; no dynamic code execution; no unusual data leaks or backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a server that manages websocket-like sockets, serving static files, and periodically broadcasting messages to connected clients. It uses gevent for concurrency. No code indicates malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage. The socket handling appears standard, with error handling and cleanup. File serving replaces placeholders with a PORT variable, which is set statically. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident in the code flow, socket usage, or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate web server component managing websocket connections and serving static files with periodic updates. There are no signs of malicious or sabotage behaviors based on the provided code.",
