{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple web server handling WebSocket-like connections and serves static files.",
  "sources": "Data is read from file system (serve_file method), environment variables (none explicitly), and sockets (receive method).",
  "sinks": "Socket send method, file reading for serving files, printing logs.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'web3socket' input triggers spawn of receive, socket data read flows into receive method, serve_file reads from filesystem, message constructed in update method and sent via socket.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or obfuscated code. No unusual or malicious behavior observed. The code uses standard libraries and gevent for concurrency. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a server that accepts incoming socket connections and spawns coroutines to handle receiving data. It serves static files, replacing placeholders with a port number. The update method periodically broadcasts a message to all connected sockets. No external or untrusted data sources are evident besides socket inputs, which are handled carefully. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are present. The code uses standard libraries, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. It appears to be a benign WebSocket server implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard WebSocket server application serving static files and broadcasting messages to connected clients. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is straightforward and appears safe.",
