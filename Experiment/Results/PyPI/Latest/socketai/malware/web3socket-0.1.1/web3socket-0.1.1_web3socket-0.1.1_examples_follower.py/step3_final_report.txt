  "purpose": "A web server managing WebSocket-like connections, serving static files, and broadcasting server time and socket count periodically.",
  "sources": "environ['PATH_INFO'], environ.get('web3socket'), filesystem files ('json.js', 'follower.html') via open().read(), socket.receive()",
  "sinks": "socket.send()",
  "flows": "socket.receive() -> assert message is None; socket.send() in update() loop",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert message is None' after socket.receive(), reliance on environment variable 'web3socket' without validation",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward server with socket management and static file serving. No malicious network activity, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The 'assert message is None' is unconventional and could cause denial of service if socket.receive() returns unexpected data, but it is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The reliance on environment variables without validation is a minor concern but not malicious. Overall, the code is benign with a minor logic flaw that could be improved for robustness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign server implementation with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The only issue is the use of 'assert' which could lead to denial of service, but this is a logic flaw rather than malicious activity. Scores are consistent: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.",
