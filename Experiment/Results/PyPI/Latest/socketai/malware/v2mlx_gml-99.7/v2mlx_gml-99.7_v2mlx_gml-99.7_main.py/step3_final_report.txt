{
  "purpose": "Passive collection of system information (hostname, username, current directory) and sending it via HTTP GET requests to external suspicious URLs for potential tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to external URLs with embedded parameters",
  "flows": "system info sources → URL parameter construction → HTTP GET request to each URL",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, passive data exfiltration without response processing, no obfuscation, no malicious payloads",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly collects system info and transmits it to external domains. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The URLs are suspicious, indicating potential privacy invasion or reconnaissance. Malware scores across reports vary, but given the passive nature and lack of malicious payloads, they should be lowered. Security risk scores are justified due to data exfiltration activity. The code's behavior aligns with privacy-invasive data collection, not active malware. The high scores reflect the privacy and security concerns, but the actual code does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs passive system info collection and exfiltration to suspicious URLs, indicating privacy invasion but no active malicious payloads. Malware scores should be adjusted downward to reflect the absence of malicious code, while security risk scores remain high due to external data transmission. Overall, behavior is suspicious but not overtly malicious.",
