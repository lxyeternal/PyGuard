  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url)",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, current_path) + rd_num -> full_url -> urlopen",
  "anomalies": "URLs appear suspicious and are not standard or well-known domains; sending system info to these URLs is unusual. The code generates a random number for each request, potentially to evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, current working directory, and generates a random number. It constructs URLs embedding this data as query parameters and attempts to fetch these URLs, logging the response. The URLs used are non-standard, potentially malicious, and are designed to exfiltrate system info. The code's behavior resembles data collection or covert communication with external servers, indicating possible malicious intent or privacy invasion. There are no obvious obfuscation or malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration. The use of hardcoded URLs and data transmission to external servers without user consent is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect system information and transmit it to potentially malicious or untrusted domains, indicating malicious behavior related to privacy invasion or data exfiltration. The domains are suspicious, and the overall behavior is consistent with malware activities aimed at covertly gathering system data.",
