  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, possibly for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() (sending data to remote servers)",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, user, current path) is gathered as sources, then sent via URL requests to remote servers (sinks) using URL encoding.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious URLs with non-standard domains, dynamic URL construction with encoded parameters, and no clear legitimate purpose for reporting system info. No explicit malicious code, but behavior suggests potential data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system information such as hostname, username, and current directory. It generates a random number and constructs URLs to send this info. The URLs are obfuscated as they are non-standard and could be used for tracking or malicious purposes. The data is sent via GET requests, which could leak system info. No direct malicious code like reverse shells or data theft functions are present, but the pattern of reporting data to external domains is suspicious and could be malicious in context.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to collect and send system information to external servers, which could be used for tracking or data exfiltration. No explicit malware functions are identified, but the behavior is potentially malicious given the unknown domains and data leakage pattern.",
