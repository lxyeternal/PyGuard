  "conclusion": "The code performs passive system info collection and exfiltration to suspicious URLs, indicating privacy invasion but no active malicious payloads. Malware scores should be adjusted downward to reflect the absence of malicious code, while security risk scores remain high due to external data transmission. Overall, behavior is suspicious but not overtly malicious."
