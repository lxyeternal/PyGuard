  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() (network communication with external URLs)",
  "flows": "System info from sources is packaged into URL parameters and sent via network requests to multiple external domains",
  "anomalies": "Usage of multiple suspicious URLs (oast domains), no user consent prompts, and passive data exfiltration without clear purpose",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, and current directory, then constructs URLs with these details and a random number. It then sends GET requests to external domains, which appear to be controlled or for testing purposes, likely for tracking or reconnaissance. The code does not process the responses beyond logging, but the data transmission to untrusted domains is suspicious. No malicious code like file manipulation, privilege escalation, or obfuscation is present. The URLs are designed for data collection, possibly for malicious surveillance or testing. Overall, the code exhibits behavior consistent with data exfiltration or reconnaissance, with no legitimate user-facing purpose evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs passive collection of system info and transmits it to external servers, likely for tracking or reconnaissance purposes. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or destructive actions, but the behavior suggests potential privacy violations or security risks associated with untrusted network communication.",
