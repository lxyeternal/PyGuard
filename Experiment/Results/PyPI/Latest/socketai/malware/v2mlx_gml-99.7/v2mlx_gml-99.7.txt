      "conclusion": "The package executes external code ('main()') during installation, which poses a significant supply chain security risk. While the actual content of 'main()' is unknown, this pattern is inherently dangerous. The scores should be adjusted upward to reflect the high potential for malicious activity, with malware score around 0.7 and security risk around 0.8. The behavior warrants caution, and verification of 'main()' is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code performs passive system info collection and exfiltration to suspicious URLs, indicating privacy invasion but no active malicious payloads. Malware scores should be adjusted downward to reflect the absence of malicious code, while security risk scores remain high due to external data transmission. Overall, behavior is suspicious but not overtly malicious."
