  "conclusion": "The package executes external code ('main()') during installation, which poses a significant supply chain security risk. While the actual content of 'main()' is unknown, this pattern is inherently dangerous. The scores should be adjusted upward to reflect the high potential for malicious activity, with malware score around 0.7 and security risk around 0.8. The behavior warrants caution, and verification of 'main()' is recommended before deployment."
