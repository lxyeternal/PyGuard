  "purpose": "The code retrieves the system hostname and contacts an external server via a curl command during package setup, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "os.uname()[1] for hostname; os.system() executing curl command to http://jacobsandum.com:1337/setup-<hostname>",
  "sinks": "External network request transmitting hostname information to a suspicious domain",
  "flows": "Hostname retrieved via os.uname()[1] -> URL constructed with hostname -> os.system() executes curl to contact external server",
  "anomalies": "Network request during setup; use of os.system() with constructed URL; presence of suspicious domain; comment \"Do NOT USE, only for testing supply chain\"",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname info and makes an external HTTP request to a suspicious domain during package setup, which is highly unusual and indicative of malicious intent. The use of os.system() with curl is insecure and can be exploited. The domain jacobsandum.com is suspicious. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but the behavior suggests potential data exfiltration or command-and-control activity. The high scores assigned in reports (malware 0.9, security risk 0.9) are justified given the suspicious external contact during setup, which could facilitate malicious activities. The comment may be an attempt to mask malicious intent. The behavior warrants high suspicion and should be flagged as malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior—contacting an external server with system info during setup—indicating malicious or compromised activity. The high malware and risk scores are justified. It should be flagged as malicious with high confidence.",
