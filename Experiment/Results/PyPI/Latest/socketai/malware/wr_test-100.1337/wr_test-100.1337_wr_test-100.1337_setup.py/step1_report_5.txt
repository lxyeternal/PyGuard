{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be setting up a Python package, but it includes a suspicious network request which may be used for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system hostname using os.uname()[1]; it also executes a system command using os.system() which performs a network request to an external URL (http://jacobsandum.com:1337/setup-<hostname>)",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executes an external command that sends a GET request to a potentially malicious server, which could be used for command and control, data exfiltration, or tracking",
  "flows": "The hostname is retrieved from the system and then interpolated into a curl command executed via os.system(), sending a request to the remote server with the hostname as part of the URL",
  "anomalies": "The use of os.uname() for hostname detection combined with a direct system call to perform a network request to an external domain is suspicious. The comment indicating 'DO NOT USE, only for testing supply chain' may be masking malicious intent or unauthorized data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing necessary modules and retrieves the system's hostname. It then performs a system call to execute a curl command, sending the hostname to an external server, which could be used for malicious tracking or command-and-control purposes. The setup() function appears typical but is preceded by this suspicious network activity. No other malicious or obfuscated code is present; the network call is the main concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious network request that contacts an external server with system information, likely for tracking or command and control. Despite the superficial appearance of a setup script, the inclusion of this network activity makes it suspicious and potentially malicious.",
