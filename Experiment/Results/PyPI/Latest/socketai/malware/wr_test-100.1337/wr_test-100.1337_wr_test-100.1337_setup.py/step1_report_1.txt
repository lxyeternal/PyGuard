{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up a Python package named 'wr_test' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname via os.uname() and executes a curl command with this hostname as part of a URL using os.system().",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executes a network request to an external domain, which could potentially transmit data or trigger malicious server-side behavior.",
  "flows": "The hostname obtained from os.uname() is used to construct a URL in the curl command, which is then executed via os.system(), causing an HTTP request to the external domain.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically constructs a URL using system information and executes it without validation, indicating possible malicious activity. The 'curl' command is used to contact a remote server, which can be used for command and control or data exfiltration. The comment 'Do NOT USE, only for testing supply chain' appears suspicious and possibly misleading.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions from setuptools and os for system interaction. It retrieves the system's hostname using os.uname()[1], with a fallback to 'failed' if empty. It then executes a system command that performs an HTTP request to 'http://jacobsandum.com:1337/setup-' concatenated with the hostname. This behavior suggests that the script contacts an external server potentially controlled by an attacker, possibly for malicious purposes such as registering the infected system, exfiltrating data, or executing further malicious code. The setup() call itself appears standard, with package configuration details, but the presence of the remote request raises security concerns about the supply chain integrity and malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior by contacting an external domain using system data, which could be malicious. This behavior indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent or security risk, as it can be used for command and control, data exfiltration, or malicious payload delivery. It should be considered malicious until proven otherwise.",
