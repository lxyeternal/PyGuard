  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration, justifying high malware and security risk scores. While not containing explicit malware payloads, its exfiltration pattern warrants classification as malicious or highly suspicious. The scores should be adjusted to reflect this high threat level, with malware score around 0.75 and risk score around 0.8. The code should be treated as malicious in intent based on its behavior."
