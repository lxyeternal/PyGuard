  "conclusion": "The code makes an external request to a suspicious domain using an insecure method. While no payload or obfuscation is present, the behavior is suspicious and could be malicious depending on the URL's nature. The current scores reflect this suspicion but could be slightly lowered if the URL is benign. Overall, the code's behavior should be treated as potentially malicious with moderate to high security concern."
