While not containing explicit malware payloads, its exfiltration pattern warrants classification as malicious or highly suspicious. The scores should be adjusted to reflect this high threat level, with malware score around 0.75 and risk score around 0.8. The code should be treated as malicious in intent based on its behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code makes an external request to a suspicious domain using an insecure method. While no payload or obfuscation is present, the behavior is suspicious and could be malicious depending on the URL's nature. The current scores reflect this suspicion but could be slightly lowered if the URL is benign. Overall, the code's behavior should be treated as potentially malicious with moderate to high security concern."
