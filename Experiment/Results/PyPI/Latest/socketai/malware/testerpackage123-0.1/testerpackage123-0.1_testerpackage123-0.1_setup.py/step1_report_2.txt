  "purpose": "To set up and distribute a Python package named 'testerpackage123'.",
  "sources": "The 'find_packages()' function which scans the directory for package modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the setup script only defines package metadata and finds packages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present. The script is a standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, then calls setup() with basic package metadata. It performs standard package setup tasks without any dynamic code execution, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. No signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior are evident. There are no inputs, outputs, or flow that could lead to security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It follows typical patterns for Python package distribution.",
