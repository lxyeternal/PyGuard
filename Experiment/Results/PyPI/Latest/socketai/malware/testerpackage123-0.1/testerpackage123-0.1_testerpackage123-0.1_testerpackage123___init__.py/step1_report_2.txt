  "purpose": "Execute base64-encoded Python code that prints a message to the console.",
  "sources": "base64-encoded string decoded and executed via exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decoded code, which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Decoding base64 string -> exec() executes the decoded code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding and exec() to hide code intent; common obfuscation technique.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the base64 module and decodes a base64-encoded string. The decoded string is then executed via exec(). The base64 string decodes to: 'import time\n\nprint(\"hello monkey boys\")\n\ntime.sleep(5)\n'. This code imports the time module, prints a greeting, and then sleeps for 5 seconds. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The obfuscation with base64 and exec() suggests an attempt to hide the code’s intent, which is simply to print a message and pause execution. The code itself is benign and appears intended for playful or testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated using base64 and exec(), but decodes to harmless Python commands that print a message and sleep. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
