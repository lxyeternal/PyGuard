  "purpose": "The code dynamically decodes and executes a base64-encoded string, which appears to be a script that prints a message.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string used in base64.b64decode()",
  "sinks": "The exec() function that executes the decoded string as Python code",
  "flows": "base64.b64decode() decodes the string -> exec() executes the resulting code",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with dynamically decoded code; the base64 string is hidden, obscuring its content and intent",
  "analysis": "The code imports the base64 module and decodes a base64-encoded string, then executes it using exec(). The decoded string is 'import time\\n\\nprint(\"hello monkey boys\")\\ntime.sleep(5)'. This results in printing a message and then pausing for 5 seconds. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. The use of exec() on decoded code is suspicious but in this case appears to be benign, as it only prints a message and sleeps.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated through base64 encoding and dynamic execution, which could be suspicious in other contexts. However, the decoded payload is benign, printing a message and sleeping. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
