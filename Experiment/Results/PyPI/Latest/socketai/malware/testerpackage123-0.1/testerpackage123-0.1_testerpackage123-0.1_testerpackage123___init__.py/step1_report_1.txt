  "purpose": "The code dynamically decodes and executes a base64-encoded string which contains additional Python code.",
  "sources": "Base64 encoded string decoded via base64.b64decode and exec functions",
  "sinks": "exec function executing decoded code",
  "flows": "base64.b64decode -> exec",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec with decoded data, which can conceal malicious code; the base64 string decodes to potentially harmful commands.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the base64 module and uses it to decode a base64 string. The decoded string is then executed via exec. Decoding the string reveals that it prints 'hello monkey boys' and then calls time.sleep(5). Since the code includes exec on a base64 string, it could be used to hide malicious payloads. The presence of exec on dynamically decoded data is suspicious, as it can run arbitrary code. The actual decoded code is benign in this snippet, but the pattern is commonly associated with obfuscated malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation through base64 encoding and dynamic execution, which is a common technique to hide malicious intent. While the specific decoded payload here appears benign, the pattern is potentially dangerous, especially if the base64 string is controlled externally. It warrants caution and further review if used in a production environment.",
