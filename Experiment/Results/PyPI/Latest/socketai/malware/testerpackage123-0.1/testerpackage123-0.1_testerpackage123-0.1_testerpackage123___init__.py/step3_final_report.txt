{
  "purpose": "Decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it, which prints a message and sleeps for 5 seconds.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string is decoded using base64.b64decode() and then executed via exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decoded code, which in this case prints a message and sleeps; potential sink if payload is malicious.",
  "flows": "Source: base64.b64decode() output; Sink: exec() execution of decoded code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding combined with exec() to obfuscate code; payload is benign but pattern is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports base64, decodes a base64 string, and executes it. The decoded code prints 'hello monkey boys' and sleeps for 5 seconds. This pattern of obfuscation is common in malicious scripts to conceal payloads. The payload itself is harmless, but the pattern warrants caution. The obfuscation score is high (~0.9), and the malware score should be low (~0.2), reflecting the benign payload. The security risk score is moderate (~0.3), due to the potential for malicious use if the payload changes or is externally controlled.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs a suspicious pattern of obfuscation via base64 and exec, which can conceal malicious behavior. Currently, the payload is benign, but the pattern itself is risky. Malware score should be low (~0.2), obfuscation high (~0.9), and overall security risk moderate (~0.3). Continuous monitoring and validation of payload source are recommended.",
