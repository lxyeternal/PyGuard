  "purpose": "Dynamically executes base64-encoded Python code, likely for initialization or dynamic behavior injection.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string which contains the actual code to be executed.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec' function executing decoded code; potential for executing malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoding -> compilation -> execution of code within 'exec'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic decoding and execution of base64-encoded code. Obfuscated import and execution pattern. The code includes a URL and appears to load code from external sources.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'builtins' and uses 'exec' to run dynamically compiled code from a base64 string. The base64 string decodes to code that imports modules, defines variables, and potentially downloads or executes remote content. The presence of 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/inject/DetXciSvq9OA6r' suggests a possible remote payload or command. The code's structure is intentionally obfuscated, making static analysis more difficult. It appears designed to conceal its true intent, potentially executing malicious payloads or backdoors. The dynamic nature and external URL indicate a high risk of malicious behavior, including remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code dynamically decodes and executes obfuscated code that appears to load or execute remote content, which is highly suspicious. This pattern is consistent with malicious behavior such as remote command execution, backdoors, or payload delivery. The obfuscation and use of external URLs increase the risk profile significantly.",
