  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward setup.py with no dynamic behavior, no external data, no suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard package configuration, static data, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical setup.py with static metadata, no dynamic code, no external dependencies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as previous; standard, static setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports agree that the setup.py is a standard, static configuration script.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.\n- All scores are 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical setup.py for packaging a Python library.\n- No dynamic code, external data, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The email and package info are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- Scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, legitimate, and typical for Python packaging.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or modifications that could introduce risks, but based on the current code and reports, there are no concerns.",
