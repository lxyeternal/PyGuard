  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for distribution of the Python library 'subsys_client'.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() such as name, version, author, description, classifiers, and find_packages() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input is processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard setup.py structure with no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup.py script using setuptools. It contains no dynamic code, external data fetching, or code execution. All data are hardcoded metadata, and the script follows common packaging practices. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. Multiple reviews confirm the benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are appropriate given the static, metadata-only content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
