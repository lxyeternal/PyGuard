  "purpose": "Setup script for configuring and distributing the 'subsys_client' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string data for package metadata and uses find_packages() to identify package modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present. No network, file, or environment variable interactions are observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident, as the script only defines package metadata and package discovery.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard setup.py configuration with no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package details such as name, version, author, description, and classifiers. It employs find_packages() to include all subpackages automatically. All data are static and predefined. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, environment variable usage, or external data fetching. The code structure follows common Python packaging practices without anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script appears to be a legitimate, standard package configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
