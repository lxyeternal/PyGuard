  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "None explicitly present in this snippet; potential source is the import statement which loads a function from a local file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs in this snippet; no untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'run' from a sibling module 'main'. Without additional context, this is a standard import. No embedded malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are visible. It is a typical pattern in Python projects to modularize code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not execute any code or data that could be malicious. The code appears benign.",
