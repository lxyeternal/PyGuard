{
  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from the local module 'main' to execute or utilize functionality defined therein.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'run' from a local module 'main'. No external input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are visible; the code only performs an import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable beyond the import statement itself; no untrusted data processing occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement with a relative path. No unusual language features, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module, which is standard practice. Since no further code is provided, there's no indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks within this snippet. The simplicity and lack of external data or execution patterns mean there are no evident security concerns or malicious intent. The snippet alone offers insufficient information to assess the behavior of 'main' or 'run'.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no malicious or security-related issues evident. It appears to be part of a larger program, and on its own, it poses no security risk.",
