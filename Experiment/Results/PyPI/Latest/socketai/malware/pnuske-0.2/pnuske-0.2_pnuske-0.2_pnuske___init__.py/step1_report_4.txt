{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'run' function from a local module named 'main', likely for executing core functionality of a package or script.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module file (main.py). No external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only an import statement; no execution or data manipulation observed.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure; absence of code logic, input handling, or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a single import statement importing 'run' from a relative module. It lacks any data processing, user input, network communication, or other behaviors that could be malicious. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment is benign, simply importing a function from a local module without any suspicious behavior. Based on this minimal snippet, there is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
