  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a straightforward import statement. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or data flow is present.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound; the code is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (low). The securityRisk score might be slightly elevated considering the minimal code, but since there's no actual risk, this seems acceptable.\n- **Justification:** The report correctly identifies the benign nature. The confidence score of 1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, a simple import.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The securityRisk is zero, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Justification:** The confidence is 0.9, reflecting high certainty, which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Again, just an import statement.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The risk score is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** High confidence score of 1 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal import.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No. The analysis correctly states that no malicious activity is visible.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Slightly elevated but acceptable given the minimal context.\n- **Justification:** Confidence is 0.4, reflecting some uncertainty due to lack of context, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The code is benign.\n- **Justification:** Confidence=1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores are zero.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation; scores are zero.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are very low, reflecting the minimal nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\nGiven the uniformity and simplicity of the code snippet, and the fact that all reports correctly identify the benign nature, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for the minimal import statement, but acknowledging no real risk)\n\n**Note:** Since the code is just an import statement, there is no indication of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores should reflect that.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1            |\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the assessment confirms the benign nature of this code snippet.",
