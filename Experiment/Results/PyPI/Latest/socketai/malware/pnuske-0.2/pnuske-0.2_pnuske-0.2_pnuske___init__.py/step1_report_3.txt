  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code imports from a relative module, which may involve reading local files or modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows since only an import statement is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "This snippet only imports a function named 'run' from a local module 'main'. It does not execute any code or perform data handling. Since it's a simple import statement, it does not present any immediate security concerns or malicious behavior. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or data leaks within this minimal code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger program where 'run' would be invoked elsewhere.",
