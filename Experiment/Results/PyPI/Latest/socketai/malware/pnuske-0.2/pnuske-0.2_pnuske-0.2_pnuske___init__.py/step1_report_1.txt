  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'main' when importing 'run'.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks; no data is being processed or output.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads 'run' from 'main', but there are no further data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only a single import statement, which is typical and not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement in Python, importing 'run' from a local module 'main'. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The simplicity suggests normal behavior, assuming the 'main' module is trusted. No external inputs, network calls, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic import operation with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears benign and standard.",
