  "purpose": "Import a local module 'main' and access its 'run' function.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .main import run' reads the 'main' module in the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The source (import) provides access to 'run', but there are no data flows or function calls in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is a standard import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement, typical in Python projects for modularization. It does not execute any code, access external data, or perform network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The import is from a local module, which is standard practice. Given the simplicity, there are no vulnerabilities or malicious intent evident. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard import statement with no malicious implications.",
  "confidence": 1,
