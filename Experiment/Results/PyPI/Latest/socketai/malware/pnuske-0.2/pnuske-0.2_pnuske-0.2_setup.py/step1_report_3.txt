{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and setup configuration for the 'pnuske' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version) and discovers packages via find_packages(). It also specifies an entry point for console script 'pnuske=pnuske:run'.",
  "sinks": "The entry point 'pnuske=pnuske:run' can execute code in the 'pnuske' module, potentially running arbitrary code if malicious. No other untrusted data sources are present.",
  "flows": "When the package is installed, invoking the command 'pnuske' executes 'pnuske:run'. This flow depends on the implementation of 'pnuske:run' in the package; the setup.py itself does not execute this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The setup script is standard for Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools to configure packaging details. It defines package name, version, and automatically finds sub-packages. An entry point is established for a command-line script. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is present in this script. Potential security concerns would depend on the implementation of 'pnuske:run' in the 'pnuske' module, which is outside this script's scope.",
  "conclusion": "This setup code is standard and does not contain malicious behavior. The only notable aspect is the console script entry point, which will run 'pnuske:run' when invoked; the security of this depends on the implementation of that function. No evidence of malicious or maliciously obfuscated code in this script.",
