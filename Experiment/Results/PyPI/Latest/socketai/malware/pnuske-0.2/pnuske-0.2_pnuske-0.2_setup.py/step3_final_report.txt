  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata, discovering sub-packages, and setting a CLI entry point to execute 'pnuske:run'.",
  "sources": "Reads package information, package discovery via find_packages(), and the entry point 'pnuske=pnuske:run'.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of 'pnuske:run' when the CLI command 'pnuske' is executed.",
  "flows": "User runs 'pnuske' command -> triggers 'pnuske:run' in the 'pnuske' module.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata, discovers packages, and specifies an entry point for a CLI command. No malicious code, obfuscation, or insecure practices are present within this script. The execution of 'pnuske:run' depends on the implementation in the 'pnuske' module, which is outside the scope of this script. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of this setup script, considering the potential execution of external code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minimal security risk is due to the invocation of an external function, which cannot be evaluated here but does not indicate malicious intent within this script itself.",
