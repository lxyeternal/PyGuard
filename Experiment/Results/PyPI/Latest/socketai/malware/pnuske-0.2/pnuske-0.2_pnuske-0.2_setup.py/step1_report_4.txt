  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for packaging and installing the Python project named 'pnuske'.",
  "sources": "Import statements from setuptools, package metadata, and entry point definition.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data or external inputs handled within this script.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script only defines package metadata and entry points without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. Usage of standard setup tools with straightforward configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'setuptools' to configure package installation. It specifies package metadata, discovers packages with 'find_packages()', and defines a console script entry point. No external inputs, user inputs, or dynamic code execution are present. The code appears standard for Python packaging and contains no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It is a benign package configuration file.",
