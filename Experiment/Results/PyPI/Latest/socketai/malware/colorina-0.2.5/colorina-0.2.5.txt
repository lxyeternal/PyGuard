      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless minimal setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All previous reports correctly identified its benign nature. The only minor discrepancy is a slightly elevated security risk score in one report, which is unwarranted given the code's simplicity. Therefore, the overall security assessment should be a score of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a malicious info-stealer, exfiltrating sensitive user data to external servers with obfuscation and fallback mechanisms. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with its behavior, with high malware and security risk scores justified. The obfuscation is moderate, primarily due to URL encoding. Overall, the code poses a significant security threat and should be classified as high risk malware."
