{
  "purpose": "The script gathers system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts, then sends this data to multiple URLs. Its primary purpose appears to be data exfiltration, likely malicious.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' for public IP; reading environment variables; reading files in user directories for Discord tokens, browser passwords, Minecraft accounts; executing system commands to retrieve HWID.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to external URLs with collected data; reading leveldb files for tokens; querying browser password databases; executing system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables, file reads, subprocess commands → collected data stored in variables → data passed to send_to_webhook function → HTTP POST requests sent to decoded URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Base64-encoded URLs decoded at runtime; multiple fallback webhook URLs; collecting sensitive data (tokens, passwords, system info, game accounts) without user consent; executing system commands for hardware ID; no validation or user prompts.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily collects potentially sensitive user data: Discord tokens, browser passwords, system info, Minecraft accounts. It uses base64 decoding for URLs, likely to obscure targets. The script accesses local storage files for tokens and passwords, which indicates malicious intent to harvest private credentials. It gathers system details like username, PC name, HWID, and IP, then exfiltrates this data via HTTP POST requests to multiple external URLs, with fallback URLs if the primary fails. The use of multiple URLs suggests an attempt to evade detection or ensure delivery. There are no signs of obfuscation beyond base64 encoding; the code structure is straightforward but intentionally designed to steal user data stealthily.",
  "conclusion": "The script demonstrates malicious behavior aimed at stealing user credentials, system information, and game account data, then exfiltrating it to external servers. Its purpose aligns with malware or info-stealing trojans. The presence of multiple fallback URLs and credential harvesting techniques strongly indicates malicious intent.",
