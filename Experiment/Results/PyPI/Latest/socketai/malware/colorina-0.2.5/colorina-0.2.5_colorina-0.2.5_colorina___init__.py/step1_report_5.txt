{
  "purpose": "The script collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data, then sends this data to multiple remote URLs, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "User input or environment variables (os.getenv, os.getlogin), filesystem (Paths to LevelDB, login data, config files), subprocess (system UUID), network requests (requests.get for IP, requests.post for data exfiltration).",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs for data exfiltration, reading local files containing sensitive information (leveldb files, login data, configs), database access for passwords, subprocess commands for system info.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables, filesystem, and system commands are gathered and stored in variables. These are then passed to the send_to_webhook function, which sends data over the network to multiple URLs, potentially leaking sensitive information.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated base64-encoded URLs decoded at runtime, multiple fallback webhook URLs indicating an attempt to ensure data exfiltration, collection of system info, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts all in one script, use of broad exception handling which suppresses errors, potential misuse of database connections. The code does not validate or sanitize any data before sending, and it collects data from potentially sensitive locations without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by decoding several base64-encoded URLs used for exfiltration, indicating obfuscation to hide malicious intent. It gathers system information including username, computer name, hardware ID, and public IP address, which could be used for profiling or tracking. It searches for Discord tokens across common storage locations, potentially harvesting tokens for account hijacking. It attempts to extract saved browser passwords from Chrome's 'Login Data' SQLite database, which involves accessing encrypted data—though it only base64-encodes the encrypted password for exfiltration, not decrypting it, thus avoiding immediate detection but still collecting sensitive data. It also looks for Minecraft accounts in specific configuration files, extracting usernames and passwords. The send_to_webhook function tries multiple URLs in sequence if previous attempts fail, ensuring persistence in data exfiltration. Overall, the script combines information gathering with obfuscated remote URLs and multiple data sources to stealthily harvest user data for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed for malicious data exfiltration, collecting sensitive user data including system info, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and gaming account details, and sending them to external servers via multiple obfuscated URLs. The presence of URL obfuscation, broad data collection, and multiple fallback mechanisms strongly indicates malicious intent.",
