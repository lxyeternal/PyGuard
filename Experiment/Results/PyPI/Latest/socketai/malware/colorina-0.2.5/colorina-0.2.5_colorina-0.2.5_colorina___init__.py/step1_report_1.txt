{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts, then sends this data to multiple webhooks, likely for unauthorized data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, filesystem paths for Discord, Chrome, Brave, Edge, ATLauncher, LunarClient, and input from SQLite database, JSON files, and subprocess commands.",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data via HTTP POST requests to external URLs (webhooks).",
  "flows": "System info, tokens, passwords, and account data are gathered from sources and then transmitted to multiple webhooks through the send_to_webhook function.",
  "anomalies": "Base64-encoded URLs decoded at runtime; attempts to read and exfiltrate Discord tokens, browser stored passwords, and game account credentials; multiple fallback webhook URLs; usage of subprocess for system info; reading encrypted passwords from Chrome without decryption; generic exception handling; no user consent or transparency.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by decoding several hardcoded base64 URLs, which are used as webhook endpoints. It gathers system information such as username, computer name, HWID, and public IP. It searches for Discord tokens across various leveldb storage paths, reading files with Latin1 encoding and matching token patterns. It attempts to access Chrome passwords stored in a local SQLite database, but only encodes and displays the encrypted password bytes without decryption, which could be a privacy concern. It looks for Minecraft account data in specific config files for ATLauncher and LunarClient, reading JSON files to extract account info. All collected data is sent via HTTP POST requests to multiple webhook URLs, with fallbacks if initial requests fail. The code is designed for stealthy data collection, likely without user consent, and exfiltrates sensitive information to external servers. The use of multiple fallback URLs, base64 URL obfuscation, and the scope of data collection strongly suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code functions as a data exfiltration tool with typical malware traits, including stealth and multiple redundancies for reliable delivery.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive user data (system info, tokens, passwords, game accounts) and exfiltrating it to external webhook URLs without user consent. The multiple fallback URLs and the nature of the data collected indicate an intent for unauthorized surveillance or theft, fitting the profile of malware. The overall security risk is high due to its malicious intent and data harvesting activities.",
