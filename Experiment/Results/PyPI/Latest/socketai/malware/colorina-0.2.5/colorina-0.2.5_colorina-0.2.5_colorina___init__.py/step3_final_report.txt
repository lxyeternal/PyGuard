{
  "purpose": "The code collects system info, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts, then exfiltrates this data via multiple webhooks, employing obfuscation techniques.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded URLs decoded at runtime; system info via os and subprocess; Discord tokens from leveldb directories; Chrome passwords from SQLite database; Minecraft accounts from JSON config files.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to external webhooks; reading local files; environment variables; subprocess commands; network requests.",
  "flows": "Decoded URLs are used as webhook endpoints; data from system info, tokens, passwords, accounts are gathered and sent via POST to these URLs; fallback URLs are used if initial requests fail.",
  "anomalies": "Base64 URL encoding for webhook endpoints; broad exception handling hiding errors; collection of encrypted passwords without decryption; multiple fallback URLs for exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script decodes multiple base64 URLs used as webhooks, collects sensitive data including system info, Discord tokens, browser passwords (unencrypted), and Minecraft accounts. It exfiltrates data via HTTP POST requests to several fallback URLs, indicating persistence and stealth. The code employs broad exception handling, which can hide errors, and reads encrypted Chrome passwords without decrypting them, raising privacy concerns. URL obfuscation via base64 is minimal but present. The overall behavior aligns with malicious intent, functioning as an info-stealer malware. The malware score is justified at 1 due to clear malicious activity. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.4), considering the URL encoding. The security risk score is high (~0.9), given the sensitive data theft and exfiltration. The code's design, data collection, and stealth features support these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a malicious info-stealer, exfiltrating sensitive user data to external servers with obfuscation and fallback mechanisms. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with its behavior, with high malware and security risk scores justified. The obfuscation is moderate, primarily due to URL encoding. Overall, the code poses a significant security threat and should be classified as high risk malware.",
