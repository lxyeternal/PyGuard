  "purpose": "The script collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data, then exfiltrates this information to multiple encoded URLs via webhooks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, system commands, local filesystem files (Discord data, browser login data, Minecraft config files), and network requests to IP API.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent through multiple HTTP POST requests to external URLs, potentially exfiltrating sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system and filesystem sources (system info, tokens, passwords, accounts) to the send_to_webhook function, which transmits it over network to multiple external URLs in sequence.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded URLs suggests obfuscation. The code collects potentially sensitive data (Discord tokens, passwords, account info) and exfiltrates without user consent. The repeated attempts to send data to multiple URLs and silent print statements indicate possible evasion or redundancy. No clear validation or encryption of collected data is performed.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by decoding multiple base64-encoded URLs, which are used as endpoints for data exfiltration. Functions are defined to gather system info, including username, computer name, HWID, and IP address. It searches for Discord tokens in local leveldb storage files, scans Chrome browser login database for saved passwords, and reads specific Minecraft client config files for account info. All collected data is transmitted via HTTP POST requests to the decoded URLs in sequence, with no user notification or consent. The network requests are embedded within the send_to_webhook function, which redundantly attempts multiple fallback URLs if initial requests fail. The overall behavior indicates data harvesting and exfiltration, typical of malware designed for privacy invasion and credential theft.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a data-stealing payload, collecting system, credential, and account information, then exfiltrating it to external servers. The obfuscation of URLs and the nature of data collected point to malicious intent. No legitimate user-driven functionality is evident; the script appears designed for clandestine data theft.",
