  "conclusion": "The code functions as a malicious info-stealer, exfiltrating sensitive user data to external servers with obfuscation and fallback mechanisms. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with its behavior, with high malware and security risk scores justified. The obfuscation is moderate, primarily due to URL encoding. Overall, the code poses a significant security threat and should be classified as high risk malware."
