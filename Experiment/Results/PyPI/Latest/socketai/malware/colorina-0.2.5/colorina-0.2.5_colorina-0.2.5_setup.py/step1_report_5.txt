  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; minimal code structure, standard setup invocation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and executes 'setup()' with default parameters. There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, or unusual behaviors. The code is a typical minimal setup script for packaging Python projects, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident from this snippet.",
