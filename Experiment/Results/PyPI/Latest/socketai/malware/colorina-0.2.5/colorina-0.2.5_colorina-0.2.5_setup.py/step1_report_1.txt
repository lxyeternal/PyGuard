  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script only calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of parameters or additional logic; straightforward usage of setuptools.setup().",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from setuptools and calls it with default arguments. No data input, environment variable usage, or external communications are present. The script appears to be a minimal setup script, standard in Python package distribution. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
