  "purpose": "The code is intended to define package setup configuration for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potential data leak points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths since there are no data inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a basic setup() call with no arguments, which is unusual but not malicious; no secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls setup() with default parameters, which is typical for package setup scripts. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic involved. It lacks any hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns. No anomalies or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard minimal setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a simple package setup with no additional logic or data handling.",
