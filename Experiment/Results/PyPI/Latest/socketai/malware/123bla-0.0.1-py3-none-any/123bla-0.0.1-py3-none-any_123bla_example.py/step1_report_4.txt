  "purpose": "A simple function to add one to a given number.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' received by the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement output; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the addition operation and then to the return.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward arithmetic operation, no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function that takes a numeric input and returns the input incremented by one. There are no external data sources, no data leaks, and no suspicious or malicious operations. No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no external communications. The structure and logic are simple and typical for a utility function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, simple function with no suspicious intent.",
