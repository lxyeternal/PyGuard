  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the addition operation, then to the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic utility function performing addition; no external dependencies, no side effects, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify these scores. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The function's purpose is clear, and the logic is transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent, and no adjustments are necessary.",
