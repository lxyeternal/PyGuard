  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for cryptographic signing operations.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; class constructor with default argument, abstract methods for cryptographic functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external calls present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; abstract methods indicate intended extension but contain no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of Python's abc module for defining an interface.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'Signer' with a constructor accepting a default private string and four abstract methods related to cryptographic signing operations. No data input/output, no code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The class appears to serve as a contract for subclasses implementing specific signing mechanisms. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a standard abstract interface for signing operations with no malicious behavior or security issues identified. It is likely intended as part of a larger cryptographic library, with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
