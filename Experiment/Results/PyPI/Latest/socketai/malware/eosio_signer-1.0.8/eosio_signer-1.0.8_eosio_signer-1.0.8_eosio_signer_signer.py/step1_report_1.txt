{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for cryptographic signing operations, specifying the interface for subclasses implementing signing, verification, and key representation methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines class structure and method signatures only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; no untrusted data handling or external communications occur.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the class only establishes an interface without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The constructor accepts an optional private key string, but does not process or store it, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with no implementation details. It provides method signatures for cryptographic operations, serving as a blueprint. There is no runtime data processing, external calls, or potentially malicious code. The class is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign abstract class serving as an interface for cryptographic signing implementations. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
