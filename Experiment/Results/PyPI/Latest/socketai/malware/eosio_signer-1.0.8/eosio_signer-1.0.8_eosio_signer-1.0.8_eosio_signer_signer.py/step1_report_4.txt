{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for a cryptographic signer with methods for key conversion, signing, and verification.",
  "sources": "No input sources; class and method definitions do not read external data or inputs directly.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only method signatures without implementation details.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is standard for abstract class definition with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class 'Signer' with placeholder methods that must be implemented by subclasses. It includes a constructor that accepts an optional private key string parameter, which defaults to an empty string, but does not store or process it. There are no external data reads, network operations, or security-sensitive actions within this snippet. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The structure and content are typical for a cryptographic interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract class for cryptographic signing operations with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is likely part of a larger cryptographic library. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are detected based on this fragment.",
