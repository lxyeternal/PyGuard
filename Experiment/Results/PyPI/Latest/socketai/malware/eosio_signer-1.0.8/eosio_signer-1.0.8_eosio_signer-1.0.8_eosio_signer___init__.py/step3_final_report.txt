{
  "purpose": "Import the EOSIOKey class from a local key module, likely for cryptographic or key management purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the import statement loads a class definition, with no runtime data flow or execution beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement, which does not execute any code or perform any operations. All reports agree that this is benign, with high confidence (0.9-1). There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The only potential concern is if the 'key' module has side effects upon import, but this cannot be determined from the snippet alone. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
