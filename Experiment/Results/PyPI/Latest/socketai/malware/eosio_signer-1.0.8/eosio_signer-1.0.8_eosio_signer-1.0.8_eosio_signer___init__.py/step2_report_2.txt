  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom .key import EOSIOKey\n```\n\n**Summary of findings from reports:**\n- All reports agree that this is a simple, standard import statement.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are identified.\n- No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious code are evident.\n- The import could potentially execute code if the `key` module has side effects, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), indicating strong certainty of benign intent.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports.\n- Security risk scores are 0, indicating no perceived security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is a straightforward relative import; no issues are present.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** The reports correctly identify the minimal, benign nature of the code.\n- **Scores consistency:** The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Potential side effects:** While import statements can execute code if the module has side effects, this cannot be confirmed or denied here; the reports appropriately do not assume malicious side effects.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and cautious, correctly concluding that the code is benign.\n- No assumptions are made beyond what the code shows.\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- If the `key` module is known to contain side effects upon import (e.g., executing code at import time), that could introduce risk, but this cannot be inferred from the snippet alone.\n- The import statement itself is standard and benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe current scores are appropriate. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The high confidence levels reflect this understanding.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the provided reports and logical analysis.",
