  "purpose": "The code imports the EOSIOKey class from a local module named key.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module file 'key'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data output points identified in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Importing the class may lead to execution of the key module's code when imported, but no data flow is evident here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual patterns, or suspicious code behavior detected in this single line.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement that brings in a class from a local module. It does not contain any executable logic, data processing, or network operations. Without additional context, there's no indication of malicious behavior. However, import statements could potentially execute code if the imported module has side effects, but this cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this minimal snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward import statement. Confidence is high that this is benign.",
