{
  "purpose": "The code imports the EOSIOKey class or object from the key module, likely for cryptographic or key management purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'key' module in the current package to access EOSIOKey.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a class or object from a local module, which is standard practice. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns are detectable in this isolated snippet. The use of relative import indicates the module is part of a package, and without additional context, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be normal package code.",
