  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the context provided.\n\n1. **Code Content Review**:\n   - The code is a simple import statement: `from .key import EOSIOKey`.\n   - It imports a class/object from a local module named `key`.\n   - There are no additional operations, data processing, or external calls.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - Based solely on this snippet, there are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The import is standard practice in Python projects.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or code execution is evident here.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Reports**:\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, which aligns with the minimal nature of the snippet.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The code does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All assign 0, which is justified since the snippet alone does not introduce security risks.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**:\n   - Import statements can sometimes execute code if the imported module has side effects, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n   - Since no such side effects are indicated, the assessments remain valid.\n\n6. **Consistency and Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the minimal code provided.\n   - No overestimation of risk or malware is evident.\n\n7. **Final Recommendations**:\n   - Given the context, the scores seem appropriate.\n   - If additional context or code were available, further analysis might be warranted.\n   - As it stands, the overall risk remains negligible.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the assessments provided and the code's simplicity.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code snippet is a benign, straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.",
