  "conclusion": "The code is cryptographically legitimate but contains a critical malicious side effect: it unconditionally collects and transmits system info to an external IP during object creation. This behavior indicates malicious intent, classifying the package as highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The malware and security risk scores should be increased to reflect this severity."
