  "purpose": "This code appears to set up a Python package using setuptools, but it also performs environment variable retrieval and system commands which may be malicious.",
  "sources": "os.getenv() calls for BX_API_HOSTNAME, BX_PRIVATE_KEY, BX_API_METADATA; os.system() commands executing hostname, whoami, ifconfig, and a curl POST request.",
  "sinks": "os.system() commands executing system info collection and data exfiltration via curl POST to IP 61.28.229.27.",
  "flows": "Retrieves environment variables -> Executes system info commands -> Writes data to /tmp/r -> Sends /tmp/r contents to remote IP.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual and suspicious behavior: executing multiple system info commands, collecting environment variables, and exfiltrating data to a remote server without clear legitimate purpose. No validation or sanitization of environment variables is performed.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers sensitive environment variables that could contain credentials or private data. It then collects system information and writes all data into a temporary file. Finally, it sends this file over HTTP POST to a specific IP address, indicating potential data exfiltration. The package setup appears normal but is overshadowed by these malicious activities. These actions suggest an attempt to steal data and communicate with a remote server, likely malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through data exfiltration and gathering system info without legitimate purpose. The package setup is normal but obscured by these activities, indicating possible supply chain attack intent.",
