{
  "purpose": "The code collects environment variables and system info, then exfiltrates this data to an external IP during package setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (BX_API_HOSTNAME, BX_PRIVATE_KEY, BX_API_METADATA), system commands (hostname, whoami, ifconfig), and the constructed /tmp/r file.",
  "sinks": "The curl command sending /tmp/r to http://61.28.229.27.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and system info are written into /tmp/r; then, the data is uploaded via curl to the external IP.",
  "anomalies": "Data collection and exfiltration during package installation, use of hardcoded IP, execution of system commands without validation, and lack of user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code reads sensitive environment variables and gathers system info via os.system calls. It appends all data into /tmp/r and then automatically uploads this file to an external IP address during setup. These actions are highly suspicious, indicating malicious intent such as data theft or backdoor activity. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and performs actions that are atypical for legitimate package setup scripts. The exfiltration of sensitive data without user knowledge confirms malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0.9, security risk: 0.9, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious activity involving data exfiltration during package installation. The high malware and security risk scores are justified, and the code should be flagged as malicious. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack patterns, and no evidence suggests benign intent.",
