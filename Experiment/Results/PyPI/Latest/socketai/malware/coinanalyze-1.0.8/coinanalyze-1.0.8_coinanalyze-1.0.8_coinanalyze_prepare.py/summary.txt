  "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the use of exec() on code from an untrusted source, which could lead to remote code execution if detect_address() returns malicious code. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present, but the execution method is dangerous. The scores should reflect a high security risk, with malware at 0.75, obfuscated at 0, and overall security risk at 0.75."
