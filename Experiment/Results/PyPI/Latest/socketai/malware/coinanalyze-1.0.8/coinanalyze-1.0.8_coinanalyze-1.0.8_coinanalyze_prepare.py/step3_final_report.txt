  "purpose": "Fetches recent mempool transactions from an external API and writes them to a file; also executes code returned by an external function, potentially executing malicious code.",

  "flows": "detect_address() output -> exec() -> code execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on data from an external or unknown source without validation",
  "analysis": "The code fetches transaction data from a public API and writes it to a file, which is benign. The critical security concern is the use of exec(rdata2), where rdata2 is the output of detect_address(). Since detect_address() is imported from utils and its implementation is unknown, executing its output is risky. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are evident; the main issue is executing untrusted code. The scores in the reports vary, but given the potential for malicious code execution, the malware score should be high (around 0.75), the obfuscated score remains 0, and the security risk score should also be elevated to reflect the danger of executing untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the use of exec() on code from an untrusted source, which could lead to remote code execution if detect_address() returns malicious code. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present, but the execution method is dangerous. The scores should reflect a high security risk, with malware at 0.75, obfuscated at 0, and overall security risk at 0.75.",
