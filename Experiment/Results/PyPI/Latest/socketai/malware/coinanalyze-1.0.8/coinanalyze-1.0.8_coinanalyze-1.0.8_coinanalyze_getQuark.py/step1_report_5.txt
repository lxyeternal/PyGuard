  "purpose": "Download and install Quark repository if not already present, to enable viewing graphs generated by Orbit.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current directory listing with os.listdir() and uses os.system() to execute shell commands for cloning a GitHub repository and moving files.",
  "sinks": "os.system() calls executing 'git clone' and 'mv' commands, which can potentially execute arbitrary commands if input is compromised, but here inputs are static and hardcoded.",
  "flows": "os.listdir() → check for 'quark.html' → if not present, os.system('git clone ...') → file moves and deletions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with string concatenation for commands, which can be unsafe if inputs are manipulated, but here inputs are static. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are observed. The code performs repository cloning and file manipulation without validation or security checks.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for the presence of 'quark.html' in the current directory. If missing, it clones the Quark repository from GitHub using os.system(), then moves library files and HTML to the current directory, deletes the repository folder, and confirms installation with print statements. The commands are static and do not involve untrusted input, reducing risk. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system compromise mechanisms are present. The use of shell commands is standard for automation but could be risky if inputs were dynamic; however, in this context, inputs are fixed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for automatic setup of a dependency, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious payloads. Its operations are standard for automated environment setup. No malicious activity detected.",
