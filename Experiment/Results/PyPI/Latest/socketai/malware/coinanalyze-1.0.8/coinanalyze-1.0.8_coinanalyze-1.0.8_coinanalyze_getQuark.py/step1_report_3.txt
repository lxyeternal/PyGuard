  "purpose": "To check for the presence of 'quark.html' and download/install the Quark tool if missing.",
  "sources": "os.listdir(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "os.system() commands for cloning, moving, and removing files",
  "flows": "os.listdir() → os.system() commands for git clone and file operations",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with shell commands for cloning repositories and moving files; removal of entire directories after cloning",
  "analysis": "The code checks if 'quark.html' exists in the current directory. If not, it constructs commands to clone a GitHub repository ('https://github.com/s0md3v/Quark') into a subdirectory, then moves certain files ('libs' directory and 'quark.html') to the current directory, and finally deletes the cloned repository. The process involves executing shell commands via os.system() which can be risky if inputs are manipulated, but here, the commands are fixed strings. The cloning of a known GitHub repo and cleanup suggests intent to install an external tool, likely for analysis or visualization. No evidence of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors are apparent. The code's behavior appears to be to automate the setup of Quark tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code automatically downloads and installs the Quark tool if not present, using standard Git and file operations. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident. The code appears to be a benign setup script, assuming the external repository is trustworthy. No indicators of malware or malicious intent are present.",
