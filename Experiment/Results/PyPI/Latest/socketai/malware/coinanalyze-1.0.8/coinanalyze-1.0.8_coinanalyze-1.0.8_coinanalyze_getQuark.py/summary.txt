  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary risk stems from executing external commands without validation, but given the static commands and trusted source, the risk remains low. Scores are consistent with the benign analysis, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk (~0.2)."
