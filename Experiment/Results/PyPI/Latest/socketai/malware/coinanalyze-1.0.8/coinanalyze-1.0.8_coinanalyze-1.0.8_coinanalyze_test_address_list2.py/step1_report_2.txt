{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a base64-encoded payload that, when decoded, likely loads or processes additional data, possibly for data exfiltration or malicious payload delivery.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded strings at the beginning and end of the code, which are decoded to binary data or executable code.",
  "sinks": "Decoding functions and potential execution or data handling functions; notably, the final lines decode base64 data and could feed into further processing or execution.",
  "flows": "The base64 strings are decoded into binary data, which might then be used for further processing, potentially leading to execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated base64-encoded data with no clear functional comments or context; the decoded data is not further processed or checked, indicating obfuscation or payload delivery intent. The final decoding of data could be used to execute or extract malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists primarily of base64-encoded strings, with some decoding operations at the end. The initial data strings appear to be large blobs of data, possibly encrypted or obfuscated. The decoding at the end converts this data back into binary form, which may be used for malicious purposes such as executing hidden code, exfiltrating data, or establishing backdoors. The absence of explicit function calls, no validation, and repeated encoding strongly suggest obfuscation to hide malicious intent. The code structure indicates an attempt to conceal the payload, typical of malicious scripts or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious due to its heavy obfuscation via base64 encoding, the decoding process that could lead to hidden malicious code, and lack of functional transparency. It appears designed to deliver or execute malicious payloads covertly, making it potentially dangerous. Caution is advised, and it should be blocked or further analyzed in a secure environment.",
