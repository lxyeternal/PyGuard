{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'coinanalyze'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data for package metadata and dependencies; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely specifies package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The 'license' field is set to 'Python Script', which is an unusual or non-standard license identifier. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data handling. The 'install_requires' and 'extras_require' specify dependencies in a typical manner. The 'license' field's value is unconventional but not malicious. No suspicious or malicious code components are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor concern is the unusual license string, which appears benign but unconventional.",
