  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script configuring package metadata and dependencies.\n- The only anomaly noted is the 'license' field set to 'Python Script', which is unconventional but not inherently malicious.\n- No untrusted data handling, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are very low or zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. All fields are static, and no external inputs or outputs are present.\n- **Errors or flaws in logic:** No errors are evident. The only minor concern is the 'license' field value, but it doesn't impact security.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores of 0 are appropriate. The security risk scores are also reasonable, given the context.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- The reports assign a security risk of 0.1 in report 3, citing the unconventional license as a minor anomaly. Given that this is not a security flaw but merely a non-standard string, I would suggest lowering this to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n- All reports correctly rate the code as non-malicious, with no obfuscation.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- **Malware:** 0, since there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** Given the benign nature, a score of 0 is appropriate; 0.1 in report 3 seems overstated.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: the code is a standard, static package configuration script with no malicious or suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent in their assessment, correctly identifying the script as benign. The only minor point is the 'license' field's value, which is unconventional but not a security concern. I recommend maintaining a malware score of 0, obfuscated as 0, and a security risk score of 0 for an accurate reflection of the code's safety.",
