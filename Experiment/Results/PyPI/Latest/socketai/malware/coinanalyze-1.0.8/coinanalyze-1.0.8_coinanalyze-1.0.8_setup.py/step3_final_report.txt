{
  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata for 'coinanalyze' using setuptools, with no runtime or dynamic behavior.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields such as name, version, description, packages, author, license, install_requires, extras_require.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; all fields are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual 'license' field value 'Python Script', which is non-standard but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static metadata, no dynamic code, input handling, or network activity. The only anomaly is the license string, which is benign. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script is benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The unconventional license string does not pose a security threat. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 accurately reflect the code's safety.",
