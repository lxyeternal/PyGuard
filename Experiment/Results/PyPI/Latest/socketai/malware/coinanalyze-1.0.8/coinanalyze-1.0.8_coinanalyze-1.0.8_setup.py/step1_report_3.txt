{
  "purpose": "To define and configure the setup for the Python package 'coinanalyze' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Input data includes package metadata such as name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies specified in install_requires and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the setup script does not perform any data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input definitions (metadata and dependencies) into the setup process; no data flows into untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The license is set to 'Python Script', which is unusual and non-standard; no other suspicious or anomalous code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools to package a Python project named 'coinanalyze'. It specifies package metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic code execution, input/output operations, or suspicious constructs. The license field value 'Python Script' is unconventional but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. Overall, the code appears to be a benign setup script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual license field is noted but does not indicate malicious activity.",
