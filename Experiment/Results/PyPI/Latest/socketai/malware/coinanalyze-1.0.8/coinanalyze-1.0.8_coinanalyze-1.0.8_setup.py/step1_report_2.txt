  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'coinanalyze' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and optional development tools.",
  "sources": "Reading package data, dependencies, and metadata from the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; setup script primarily defines package metadata and dependencies without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "License set to 'Python Script' which is unconventional; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script that specifies package name, version, description, author, license, required dependencies, and optional dev dependencies. No code execution or untrusted input handling occurs. The 'install_requires' and 'extras_require' are typical dependency declarations. The license field's value is unconventional but not malicious. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It lacks runtime code that could be exploited or used maliciously. Overall, it appears safe.",
