{
  "purpose": "To define and configure the packaging details for the 'coinanalyze' Python module for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package information such as name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs are present; the code does not handle external input or write sensitive data.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code is a static configuration script with no runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The license field is set to 'Python Script', which is unconventional and potentially indicates placeholder or misconfigured license info. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present. The code relies on standard packaging functions with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() to configure package metadata and dependencies. All fields appear typical for a Python package setup. The license field's value is unusual but not inherently malicious. The dependencies listed are standard and benign. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or suspicious behaviors. Overall, the script appears to be a straightforward package configuration with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior detected. The only minor anomaly is the unconventional license value, which does not pose security risks. No malware or security threats are evident.",
