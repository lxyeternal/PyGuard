{
  "purpose": "The code monitors cryptocurrency wallet balances and transactions by periodically fetching data from a blockchain API and logging updates.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://blockchain.info/rawaddr/{wallet_address}', reading input data from 'wallets' parameter and 'filename', reading system time with 'time.time()'.",
  "sinks": "API requests sending wallet addresses, writing logs to a file, playing sound notifications, printing to console.",
  "flows": "Wallet addresses and data fetched from API → processed for balance and transaction changes → logged and notifications triggered.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of an infinite loop with sleep for periodic checks; no apparent malicious anomalies or suspicious code patterns. The 'requester' function appears redundant and unused; no malicious payload or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API requests to fetch wallet data, compare balances, detect new transactions, and log the details. It also plays a sound on new transactions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious functions are present. The only unusual aspect is the unused 'requester' function, which does not impact functionality. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's structure is straightforward, and it appears intended for wallet monitoring with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical wallet monitoring script without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No malware or security risks are evident based on the provided code. The only minor concern is the unused 'requester' function, which does not pose a security threat.",
