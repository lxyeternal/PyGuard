{
  "purpose": "Monitor specified Bitcoin wallets for balance changes and new transactions, log events, and notify via sound alerts.",
  "sources": "API responses from blockchain.info for each wallet address, reading wallet data and transaction details.",
  "sinks": "Logging to file, printing to console, playing notification sound, updating wallet state in memory.",
  "flows": "API response data flows from requests.get to JSON parsing, then to balance and transaction processing, with notifications and state updates.",
  "anomalies": "Reinitialization of 'processed_transactions' set each loop, modules 'time' and 'datetime' are used but not imported, hardcoded sound filename, potential duplicate notifications.",
  "analysis": "The code periodically fetches wallet data from blockchain.info, detects balance changes and new transactions, logs details, and plays a notification sound. It handles network errors gracefully. The main security concern is minimal; no malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The 'processed_transactions' set is reinitialized each cycle, which prevents proper deduplication of transactions, but this is a logical flaw, not malicious. Missing imports ('time', 'datetime') would cause runtime errors but do not impact security. The use of external sound files and infinite loops are operational considerations. The 'requester' function is unused, which is benign. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to operational inefficiencies, but no security threat exists.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward wallet monitoring script with no malicious behavior. Minor logical flaws and operational inefficiencies are present but do not constitute security risks. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code analysis.",
