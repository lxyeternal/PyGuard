{
  "purpose": "The code monitors cryptocurrency wallets for balance changes and new transactions by querying a blockchain API and logs updates, also playing a sound notification for new transactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads wallet data from the input parameter 'wallets', reads the API response data via HTTP GET requests to 'https://blockchain.info/rawaddr/{wallet_address}', and reads the current time using 'time.time()'.",
  "sinks": "The code writes logs to a specified file, outputs information to the console, and plays a sound file 'soundfile.wav'.",
  "flows": "Input wallet data → API request to fetch wallet info → Processes JSON response → Detects balance changes or new transactions → Logs info and plays sound → Loops every 60 seconds.",
  "anomalies": "Uses an infinite loop without clear termination condition, relies on hardcoded sound file 'soundfile.wav', and references 'time' and 'datetime' modules without explicit imports. The 'processed_transactions' set is reinitialized on each loop iteration, which may cause repeated notifications for the same transaction. No explicit validation or sanitization of wallet input data is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches wallet data from an external API and processes the response to detect balance changes and new transactions. It logs events and plays a sound for each new transaction. However, it does not include any malicious code such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or network connections beyond the API request. It operates purely as a monitoring tool. The reinitialization of 'processed_transactions' within each loop causes potential duplicate notifications for transactions already processed, which is inefficient but not malicious. Usage of external sound files and logging could be used to infer user activity but are not inherently malicious. There are no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns or backdoors detected. Overall, the code appears intended for legitimate wallet monitoring without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a wallet monitoring utility that fetches data from a blockchain API, logs events, and notifies the user via sound. No malicious intent or malware is detected. The code is straightforward with minor inefficiencies but no security risks or malicious behavior.",
