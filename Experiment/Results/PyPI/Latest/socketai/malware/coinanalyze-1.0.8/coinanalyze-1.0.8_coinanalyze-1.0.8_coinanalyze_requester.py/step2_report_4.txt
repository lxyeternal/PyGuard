  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present in code?** No. The code matches the description; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Errors/flaws?** The report correctly notes no obfuscation or malware, and the code's purpose is legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1 seem reasonable; the low risk score aligns with the benign analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is straightforward, and the 'requester' function is unused but benign.\n- **Errors/flaws?** The report correctly points out the unused function and benign behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to above, standard API polling and logging.\n- **Errors/flaws?** The analysis correctly states no malicious behavior, with minor notes on the unused function.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No malicious code detected. The only minor inefficiency is reinitializing 'processed_transactions' each loop, which could cause duplicate notifications but not malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws?** The report notes the missing imports ('time', 'datetime') but this is a code issue, not security.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Well-reasoned.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a standard wallet monitoring script.\n- **Errors/flaws?** The only potential concern is the unvalidated URL in 'requester', but it only requests from a fixed domain, so no injection risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, and there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly vary between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting minimal security concerns—mainly resource use or minor inefficiencies, not malicious intent.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor resource considerations, no real security threat.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, benign wallet monitoring script. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The low risk score is justified, and the malware score should remain at zero.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
