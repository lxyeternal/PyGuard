  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate utility and testing scaffolding for blockchain data analysis. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the complexity of mocking but no inherent threat."
