{
  "purpose": "The code handles blockchain data collection, database storage, and testing scaffolding for blockchain-related applications.",
  "sources": "Reads blockchain blocks via web3, API responses from mempool.space, and database interactions.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to SQLite database, outputs to files, and makes network requests.",
  "flows": "Blockchain data fetched -> processed -> stored in database; API responses fetched -> parsed -> stored; testing mocks intercept database and network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious dynamic code detected. Extensive mocking could obscure malicious activity but none is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard blockchain data collection, API interaction, and testing setup. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Mocking and testing infrastructure are typical for development environments. No anomalies or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate utility and testing scaffolding for blockchain data analysis. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the complexity of mocking but no inherent threat.",
