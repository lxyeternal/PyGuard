  "security_risk": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple red flags indicative of malicious or backdoored behavior, primarily due to dynamic code execution (`exec()`), obfuscation, and external URL handling. These patterns suggest a high potential for malicious activity, warranting caution. The scores in the reports are generally appropriate, but based on this analysis, the overall malware likelihood is estimated at 0.75, with obfuscation at 0.6 and security risk at 0.75, reflecting a high threat level."
