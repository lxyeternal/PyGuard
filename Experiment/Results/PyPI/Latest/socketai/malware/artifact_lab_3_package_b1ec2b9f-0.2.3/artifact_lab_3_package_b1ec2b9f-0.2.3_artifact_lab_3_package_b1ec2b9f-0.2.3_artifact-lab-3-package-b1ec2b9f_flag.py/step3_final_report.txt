  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates environment variables and system info to a suspicious external URL via base64-encoded POST requests.",
  "sources": "os.environ and subprocess.call('env') outputs",
  "sinks": "requests.post to external URL with encoded data",
  "flows": "Source data (environment info) encoded in base64, sent via HTTP POST to external server",
  "anomalies": "Repeated data exfiltration without validation, no obfuscation beyond base64, suspicious URL, no user consent",
  "analysis": "The code collects environment variables and system info, encodes both in base64, and sends them twice to a suspicious URL, indicating data exfiltration. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present; the activity suggests reconnaissance or privacy violation. The behavior is malicious in intent but lacks payloads or persistence mechanisms. The current scores in reports overstate malware likelihood; based on behavior, malware score should be adjusted downward, and obfuscation score minimized.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs suspicious environment data exfiltration to an external server, indicating malicious intent. However, it does not contain payloads or malicious payload execution. The activity warrants high security risk scores but moderate malware scores. The scores should be adjusted to reflect high suspicion of malicious activity without overestimating malware presence.",
