  ],
  "analysis": "The code retrieves all environment variables via os.environ and also executes 'env' command to gather environment info. Both data sets are encoded with base64 to possibly evade simple inspection and then sent to a suspicious external URL using POST requests. The purpose seems to be exfiltration of environment data, which could include sensitive information such as credentials or environment configurations. There are no input validation or security checks, and the external domain appears to be malicious. The use of base64 encoding is a common technique to obfuscate data exfiltration. No malicious code execution or backdoors are explicitly present, but the pattern of data collection and exfiltration strongly suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, as it collects environment data and system information and exfiltrates it to a suspicious domain without clear purpose. This behavior is indicative of a data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity, representing a security risk.",
