{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'artifact-lab-3-package-b1ec2b9f' including its dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package information and dependencies directly from the script (e.g., package name, version, dependencies).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any external data sinks or untrusted data handling; it only prepares package metadata.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the script is solely for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic are present. The code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard functions from setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and uses find_packages() to locate package modules. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The dependencies are straightforward and commonly used. No obfuscation, hidden code, or unusual logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate and standard configuration for packaging a Python project. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
