  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package, including its name, version, packages to include, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values for package name, version, and dependencies. It also uses the find_packages() function to discover packages in the directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; the code does not handle user input or external data streams.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present; the code solely specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The setup appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools to configure a Python package. It includes static package metadata and a fixed dependency list. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The dependencies are standard packages, and no dynamic or untrusted inputs are used.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows common packaging practices without anomalies.",
