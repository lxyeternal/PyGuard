  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, find packages, and specify dependencies.",
  "sources": "No untrusted input, external data, or dynamic code; static package metadata and dependency declaration.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, defines package name, version, discovers packages with find_packages(), and specifies a single dependency on requests>=2.32.3. There are no dynamic elements, user inputs, or external data handling. The code does not execute any untrusted code, nor does it contain obfuscation or malicious logic. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0. Confidence scores are high (1), reflecting the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports accurately assess its safety, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
