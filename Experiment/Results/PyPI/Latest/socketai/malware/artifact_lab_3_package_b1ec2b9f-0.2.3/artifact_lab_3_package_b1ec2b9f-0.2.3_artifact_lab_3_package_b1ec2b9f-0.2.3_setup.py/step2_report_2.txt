  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no untrusted inputs, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- The package name appears as a hash-like string, but this alone isn't suspicious.\n- The only dependency is 'requests', a common library, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n- The code matches the original code provided.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The analysis in each report correctly states that this is a benign, standard package setup script.\n\n### Issue Presence:\n- **Are any issues present?**  \n  No. The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n\n### Logical & Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No flawed reasoning or logical errors are evident.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Any recommendations for score adjustments?\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the package name looks like a hash, one might consider whether it indicates automated or obfuscated naming. However, this alone isn't malicious.\n- The dependency 'requests' is common and unaltered.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, safe setup script.**",
