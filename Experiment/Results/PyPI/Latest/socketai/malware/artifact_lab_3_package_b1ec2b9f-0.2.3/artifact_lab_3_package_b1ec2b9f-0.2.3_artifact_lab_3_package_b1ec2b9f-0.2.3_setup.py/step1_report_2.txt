  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious activity are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code simply defines setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and dependencies. It specifies a package name, version, and dependencies, which are common in Python packaging. There is no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no manipulation of environment variables or sensitive data. The code appears to be straightforward and adheres to standard practices. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It is safe to use and review further as part of the package supply chain.",
