  "sources": "User-provided setup() function call and its parameters.",
  "sinks": "Installation of dependencies (requests library). No untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; standard package setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setuptools setup script that specifies package name, version, found packages, and required dependencies. It uses standard functions and syntax. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalous code is present. The dependency 'requests' is a common library and there is no indication of malicious intent. The package name appears as a hashed or unique identifier, which is typical in automated package naming but not suspicious on its own.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a typical, benign Python packaging configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
