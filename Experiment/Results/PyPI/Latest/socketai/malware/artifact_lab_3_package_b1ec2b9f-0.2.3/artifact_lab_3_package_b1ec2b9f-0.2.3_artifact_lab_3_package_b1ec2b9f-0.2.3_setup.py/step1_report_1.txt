  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, package discovery with find_packages(), and dependencies specified in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, dependencies like 'requests' could be exploited if malicious, but no direct sink of untrusted data is present in this code.",
  "flows": "Package metadata and dependencies are defined and passed to setup() without data flow from external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python project. It imports 'setuptools', defines package metadata including name and version, discovers packages with 'find_packages()', and specifies dependencies. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are involved. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation, and the code performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures package metadata and dependencies.",
