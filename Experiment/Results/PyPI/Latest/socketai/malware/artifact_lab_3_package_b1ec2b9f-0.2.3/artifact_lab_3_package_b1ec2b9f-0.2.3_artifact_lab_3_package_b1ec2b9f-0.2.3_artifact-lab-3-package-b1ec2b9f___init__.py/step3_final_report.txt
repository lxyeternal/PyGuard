  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data such as environment variables, user inputs, network sources, or file reads; specific functions like eval() or exec() on untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, code execution points like eval()/exec(), network transmissions, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "From sources like untrusted input or environment variables to sinks such as eval(), network calls, or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation patterns, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "All reports primarily lack actual code, limiting detailed analysis. Reports 1-4 correctly assign zero malware and obfuscation scores, with low to moderate security risk scores reflecting cautious assessments. Report 5 identifies risky patterns like eval() on untrusted data, which warrants a higher security risk score. The overall scores are consistent with the evidence, with the main adjustment being a slight increase in security risk for report 5 due to unsafe practices. No concrete malicious activity is observed, so malware scores remain at zero. Obfuscation is not detected in any report.",
  "conclusion": "The assessments are appropriate given the limited code evidence. The notable exception is report 5, where risky eval()/exec() usage justifies a marginally higher security risk score. Overall, the scores accurately reflect the level of concern based on the available information.",
