  "sources": "The code reads data from input sources such as user input, environment variables, or external files; however, the specific sources are not detailed in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include places where untrusted data could influence system behavior, such as executing commands, writing files, or sending data over the network; however, no explicit sinks are identifiable in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through variable assignments, function calls, or other processing steps, but specific flow paths cannot be determined without concrete code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are evident in the provided code. The snippet appears standard and clean.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is limited due to the absence of actual code content. Based on the structure of the prompt, the code should be reviewed thoroughly for security risks, but no specific code is provided to examine. Without concrete code, no suspicious patterns, malicious behaviors, or anomalies can be identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign; however, a detailed review of actual code content is necessary for a definitive assessment.",
