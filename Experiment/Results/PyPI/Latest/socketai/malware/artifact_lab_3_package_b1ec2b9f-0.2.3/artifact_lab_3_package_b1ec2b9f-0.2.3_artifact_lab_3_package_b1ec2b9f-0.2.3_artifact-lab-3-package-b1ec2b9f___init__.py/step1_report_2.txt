  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or interaction with external systems, but without seeing specific code, the exact purpose cannot be definitively identified.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment variables, function parameters, or potentially from network sources if present. Exact sources are not specified due to lack of visible code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file system writes, or execution of system commands. Specific sink points are not visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs towards sinks like network, files, or system commands. Precise flow paths cannot be detailed without concrete code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious string manipulations, or unusual behaviors are identifiable from the absence of actual code snippets. No obfuscation indicators are visible.",
  "analysis": "Due to the lack of specific code content, an exact step-by-step analysis is limited. No obvious malicious patterns, malicious imports, or suspicious code constructs are apparent. Without concrete code, this analysis relies on the general structure and common patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code content, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign; however, without the actual code, this cannot be confirmed definitively.",
