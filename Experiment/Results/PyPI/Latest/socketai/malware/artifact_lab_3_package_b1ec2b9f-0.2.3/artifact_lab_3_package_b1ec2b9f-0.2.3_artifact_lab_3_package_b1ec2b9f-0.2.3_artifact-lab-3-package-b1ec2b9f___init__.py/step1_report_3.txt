  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a basic utility or script with no clear malicious intent, possibly for data processing or automation.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file writes, or system commands, but none are explicitly present in this fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, but no untrusted data is directed to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are observed. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines functions for typical tasks. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The absence of external data sources, suspicious variable names, or encrypted payloads indicates no malicious intent. The code structure is clear, with no unusual patterns or obfuscated parts. It operates within the bounds of normal utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script with no suspicious activity detected.",
