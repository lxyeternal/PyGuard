      "conclusion": "The code's execution of 'main()' during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a common vector for supply chain attacks. While no malicious code is explicitly present in the snippet, this pattern is inherently risky. The malware score should be high due to the potential for malicious payload execution, and the security risk score should reflect the high danger of executing arbitrary code during setup."

      "conclusion": "The script performs covert system info collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive intent. While it lacks destructive payloads, its behavior warrants classification as potentially malicious reconnaissance or privacy invasion activity. The malware score should be high enough to reflect this, and the security risk score should be elevated accordingly."
