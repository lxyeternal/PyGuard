  "conclusion": "The code's execution of 'main()' during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a common vector for supply chain attacks. While no malicious code is explicitly present in the snippet, this pattern is inherently risky. The malware score should be high due to the potential for malicious payload execution, and the security risk score should reflect the high danger of executing arbitrary code during setup."
