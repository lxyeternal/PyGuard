{
  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data encoded in base64 to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "Reading system info via platform, getpass, os, and subprocess; gathering MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external URLs with URL parameters containing system info, potentially leaking data.",
  "flows": "System info sources (MAC, hostname, username, directory) are encoded and appended as URL parameters, then sent via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with obfuscated, suspicious domains; encoding MAC addresses; no response handling beyond pass; lack of any validation or user consent prompts.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers environment details and encodes MAC addresses in base64, then constructs URLs with these parameters, sending requests to suspicious domains possibly for tracking or data exfiltration. The URLs appear malicious or at least suspicious due to their domain names and use of obfuscated, encoded data. The code does not perform any malicious actions like file modification, command execution beyond environment info gathering, or data theft from user data outside of system info. It appears primarily to exfiltrate device info to external servers, which is a privacy concern but not outright malware. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The network activity and encoding of MAC addresses suggest tracking or fingerprinting intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script primarily collects system information and transmits it to suspicious external servers, indicating potential privacy invasion or fingerprinting activity. No malicious code such as reverse shells, data theft beyond system info, or destructive actions are present. The activity is suspicious and potentially harmful for user privacy but lacks direct malicious payloads.",
