  "purpose": "Collect system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then encode and send this data to multiple remote URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() (reads system network interfaces), random.randint() (generates a random number), base64.b64encode() (encodes data for transmission).",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() (sends data to external URLs).",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) are collected, encoded in base64, assembled into URL parameters, and transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with seemingly obfuscated domains, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and transmission of potentially sensitive data to untrusted domains. The URLs appear suspicious and are associated with domains used in malicious or testing environments. The code does not validate responses or restrict data flow, and silently ignores exceptions, which could mask malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system identifiers such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses from different OS platforms. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 before transmitting. The URLs targeted are suspicious and likely malicious or used for tracking or exfiltration. Data is sent via GET requests with parameters that include system details, which could lead to privacy violations or be used for malicious reconnaissance. There are no safeguards, authentication, or data validation, and the silent exception handling prevents detection of failures or malicious interference. The use of obfuscated domain names and encoding suggests an attempt to hide the data exfiltration activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to collect sensitive system information and send it to external servers, potentially for malicious purposes such as tracking, reconnaissance, or data exfiltration. The suspicious domains and lack of safeguards strongly indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code exhibits malicious behavior with high security risk.",
