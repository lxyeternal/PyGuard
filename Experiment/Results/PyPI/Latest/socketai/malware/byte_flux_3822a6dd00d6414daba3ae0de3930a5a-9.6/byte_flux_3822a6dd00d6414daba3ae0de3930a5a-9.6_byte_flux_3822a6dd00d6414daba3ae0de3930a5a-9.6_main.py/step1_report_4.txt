{
  "purpose": "The script gathers system information including hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory, and random number, then encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data to multiple external URLs as URL parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), retrieves MAC addresses via system commands, and generates a random number.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over HTTP GET requests to external URLs using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources and MAC address encoding flows into URL parameters and is transmitted to external servers via HTTP GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple system-specific commands to gather MAC addresses, encoding MAC addresses in base64, and transmitting data to suspicious domains (oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast-row.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). The URLs appear to be related to security testing or sandboxing environments, but could also be malicious C2 channels.",
  "analysis": "The code collects host and user information, MAC addresses, and current directory. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 before sending. The data is transmitted to multiple URLs which are potentially malicious or used for command and control. The code does not perform any destructive actions, but it leaks system information to external domains without user consent. The choice of domains and the use of URL parameters suggest possible data exfiltration or malicious reconnaissance activities. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code injection are present, but the behavior indicates potential privacy violations or command and control communication.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be designed for gathering system information and sending it to external servers, possibly for malicious or surveillance purposes. While it does not contain overt malware such as damage or backdoors, the data exfiltration to suspicious domains raises security concerns.",
