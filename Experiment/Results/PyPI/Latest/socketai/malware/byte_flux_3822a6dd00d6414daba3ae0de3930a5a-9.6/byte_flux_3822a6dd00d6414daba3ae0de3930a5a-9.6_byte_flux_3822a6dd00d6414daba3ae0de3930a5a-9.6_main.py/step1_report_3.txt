  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it encoded to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() for each constructed URL with parameters including encoded MAC addresses and system info",
  "flows": "System info sources -> URL parameter encoding -> URL construction -> HTTP GET request to external URLs",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding on MAC addresses, construction of URLs with user/system info, multiple external requests without validation or encryption",
  "analysis": "The script gathers sensitive system data such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes MAC addresses in base64 before including them in URL parameters. It then sends HTTP GET requests to three external domains, which appear suspicious and are possibly malicious. No explicit data validation or user consent is present. The code communicates system info over network to potentially malicious servers, which could be used for fingerprinting or data exfiltration. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious backdoor code is detected, but the data exfiltration activity is suspicious and aligns with common tactics for system reconnaissance or tracking. The URL endpoints appear suspicious and are unlikely to be legitimate services, indicating malicious intent or at least malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system data collection and exfiltration to suspicious external servers without user consent. It demonstrates potentially malicious behavior, primarily data leakage or system reconnaissance. The code is not obfuscated, but it exhibits significant privacy and security risks by transmitting sensitive information over HTTP to untrusted domains.",
