{
  "purpose": "Collects system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses; encodes MAC addresses in base64; sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple suspicious URLs for potential fingerprinting or exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system info, and the URL request loop.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with encoded parameters containing system info.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, MAC addresses) are encoded and included as URL parameters, then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to each URL in the list.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious domains used for data transmission, encoding of MAC addresses, silent exception handling masking errors, no validation or user consent, multiple external requests for system info exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system identifiers and network info, encodes MAC addresses, and transmits this data to external, suspicious domains. No destructive or malicious payloads are present, but the activity resembles covert fingerprinting or data exfiltration. The use of suspicious URLs and encoding techniques raises privacy and security concerns. The silent exception handling could mask failures or malicious activity. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation beyond base64 encoding, and no malicious commands or backdoors. The activity aligns with reconnaissance or privacy invasion behaviors, which can be malicious depending on context.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs covert system info collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive intent. While it lacks destructive payloads, its behavior warrants classification as potentially malicious reconnaissance or privacy invasion activity. The malware score should be high enough to reflect this, and the security risk score should be elevated accordingly.",
