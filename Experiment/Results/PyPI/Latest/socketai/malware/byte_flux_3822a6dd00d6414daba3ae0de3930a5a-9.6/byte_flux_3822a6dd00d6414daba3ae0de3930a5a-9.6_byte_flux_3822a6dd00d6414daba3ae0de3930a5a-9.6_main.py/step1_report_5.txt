  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it encoded to multiple remote URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() (which uses subprocess to run system commands), base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to remote URLs with encoded system info as GET parameters.",
  "flows": "Data from system info functions flows into URL parameters, which are sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs used are suspicious and appear to be for tracking or command-and-control purposes. The code encodes MAC addresses in base64 before transmission, potentially obfuscating data. No user input is directly accepted, but system data is collected and transmitted silently. Exception handling suppresses errors, avoiding detection.",
  "analysis": "The code collects host-specific information: hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses via platform-dependent system calls. MAC addresses are base64-encoded, possibly to obfuscate the data. It then constructs URLs with these parameters, including a randomly generated number, and sends HTTP GET requests to three suspicious domains, likely for tracking or data exfiltration. The code does not include any user prompts or apparent malicious payloads like file manipulation or command execution beyond information gathering. The URLs are suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent to track or identify systems secretly. The code does not perform any harmful actions on the local system, but its purpose appears to be covert data collection and transmission, aligning with malicious tracking or reconnaissance activities.",
  "conclusion": "This script collects system identifiers and transmits them to suspicious external domains, indicating malicious tracking or reconnaissance behavior. It does not execute destructive actions but covertly exfiltrates system data, warranting a high security concern.",
