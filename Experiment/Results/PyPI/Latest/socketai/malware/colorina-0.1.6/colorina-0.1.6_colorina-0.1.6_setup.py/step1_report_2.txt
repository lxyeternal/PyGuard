  "purpose": "The code is used to define and run the setup process for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it simply calls the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the setup() function executes without processing external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "This script imports setuptools and executes setup() with default parameters. It performs a basic package setup with no additional configuration, data handling, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard minimal setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and typical for Python package distribution.",
