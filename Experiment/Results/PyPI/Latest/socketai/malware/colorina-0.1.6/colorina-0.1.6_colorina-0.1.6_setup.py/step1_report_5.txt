  "purpose": "The code is used to set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call, which may read package metadata and configuration if parameters are provided (though none are in this case).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data or external outputs are invoked.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; setup() is called with no arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the setup function from setuptools and calls setup() with no arguments. This is a minimal setup script that does not specify any package metadata or code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code performs a common package setup pattern with no apparent anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply invokes setuptools.setup() with default parameters, which is common in Python packaging.",
