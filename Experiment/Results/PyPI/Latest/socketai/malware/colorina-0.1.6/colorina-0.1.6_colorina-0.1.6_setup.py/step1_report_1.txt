  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'setup' function from the 'setuptools' library.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code simply calls 'setup()' with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward with no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from the 'setuptools' package and calls it with no arguments. This is a typical minimal setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, no untrusted data processing, nor any suspicious or unusual code constructs. It appears to be a standard, benign package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
