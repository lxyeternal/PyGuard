{
  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64 URL, collects system info, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts, then exfiltrates this data via webhook.",
  "sources": "Filesystem (leveldb files, login data, config JSONs), environment variables, subprocess commands, network requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to the decoded URL, reading files, environment variables, subprocess output.",
  "flows": "Data is read from filesystem/environment/subprocess, then sent via network POST to the decoded URL.",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 URL decoding for the target URL, no user consent prompts, broad exception handling hiding errors, collection of sensitive data without notification.",
  "analysis": "The script performs covert collection of sensitive user data (system info, Discord tokens, passwords, Minecraft accounts) and exfiltrates it to a remote server. The URL is obfuscated via base64 decoding. The code accesses multiple data sources stealthily, with no user interaction or consent. It employs broad exception handling, indicating an attempt to hide errors. The data exfiltration is direct and unencrypted, characteristic of malware designed for privacy invasion and data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior typical of spyware or info-stealing malware, with covert data collection and exfiltration. The high scores for malware and security risk are justified. The obfuscation is minimal but present via URL encoding. Overall, the script should be classified as high severity malware with significant security implications.",
