  "purpose": "The code is designed to gather system information, extract Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data, then send this information to a remote server via a webhook.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (APPDATA, LOCALAPPDATA, USERPROFILE), user directories, and files read from leveldb, sqlite, and JSON files.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to an external URL via HTTP POST request to a base64-decoded URL, potentially exfiltrating sensitive information. Additionally, the code executes system commands (wmic), reads browser credential databases, and reads local configuration files.",
  "flows": "Sources (local files, environment variables, subprocess output) feed data into functions that process and extract sensitive info, which then flows into the 'send_to_webhook' function, transmitting the data externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code decodes a URL from base64, then uses it for data exfiltration without user consent. It attempts to gather system info, tokens, passwords, and accounts stealthily. Use of broad exception handling without error logging can hide failures. The code accesses potentially sensitive data and exfiltrates it automatically. There is no user consent or indication of benign purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system info such as username, PC name, HWID, and IP address. It searches for Discord tokens across multiple directories, extracts saved browser passwords from Chrome's local database, and attempts to find Minecraft account info from specific config files. The code encodes the gathered data into a formatted string and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, base64-decoded URL. The use of environment variables, file system access, subprocess execution, and network communication indicates attempts at stealthy data collection. The absence of any user prompts, the stealthy nature of the data exfiltration, and the collection of sensitive information without user awareness suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a credential and system info stealer, exfiltrating sensitive data to a remote server covertly. It exhibits typical traits of malware designed for unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, with no clear benign purpose. The overall security risk is high, indicating the package should be considered malicious.",
