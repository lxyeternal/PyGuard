{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data, then send this information to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' for public IP, reading files from various leveldb directories for tokens, reading 'logins' table from Chrome's 'Login Data' database for passwords, reading account JSON files for Minecraft accounts, and reading system info via environment variables and subprocess commands.",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data to a remote URL via HTTP POST request with 'requests.post'.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from various sources (system info, tokens, passwords, accounts) and then sent directly to the webhook via the send_to_webhook() function.",
  "anomalies": "The script attempts to gather sensitive information such as Discord tokens, saved browser passwords, and Minecraft account credentials without user consent. It encodes the URL with base64, which could be obfuscation. It also collects hardware ID and IP address potentially for tracking. No clear user notification or permission request is present. The data is transmitted to an external URL automatically.",
  "analysis": "The code first decodes a base64-encoded URL intended for data exfiltration. It defines functions to gather system info, public IP, Discord tokens from LevelDB storage, saved browser passwords from Chrome's login database, and Minecraft accounts from specific config files. The data collection functions involve reading files, querying databases, and executing system commands, which are typical for data harvesting malicious scripts. The data is sent via HTTP POST to the decoded URL without user consent or notification. The code does not contain obfuscated code beyond base64 URL encoding and standard variable naming. It does not perform any malicious actions like damaging files, cryptocurrency mining, or establishing reverse shells, but it does perform stealthy data exfiltration of sensitive information.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a data stealer or information harvester designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data (system info, Discord tokens, passwords, Minecraft accounts) to an external server. It does not appear to cause direct harm or damage, but it compromises user privacy and security by collecting and transmitting private data without consent. The obfuscation of the webhook URL and collection of multiple sensitive data points are characteristic of potentially malicious intent.",
