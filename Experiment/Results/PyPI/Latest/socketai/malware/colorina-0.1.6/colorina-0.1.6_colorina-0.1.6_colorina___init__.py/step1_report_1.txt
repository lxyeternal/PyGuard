{
  "purpose": "Collect system info, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts, then send this data to a remote server via webhook.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, accessing filesystem paths for Discord, Chrome, LunarClient config files, and Windows system commands.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via HTTP POST request to a remote URL, printing debug info.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables, filesystem, subprocess commands -> collected data (system info, tokens, passwords, accounts) -> sent to remote URL via webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded URL decoded within the script, extensive data collection including Discord tokens, browser passwords, and system info; no user prompts or consent mechanisms; plaintext transmission of sensitive info; attempt to gather HWID; use of subprocess to fetch UUID; potential for malicious activity if used without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script decodes a base64 URL for data exfiltration, gathers sensitive user data including Discord tokens, saved browser passwords, and system info. It also retrieves hardware UUID and public IP. The data is sent to an external server via webhook. The code uses multiple filesystem paths for popular browsers and Discord, indicating an intent to harvest user credentials and tokens. The function 'send_to_webhook' transmits all collected data, potentially maliciously. No obfuscation or code hiding is present. The code’s activities resemble malicious data harvesting with exfiltration, with no apparent user authorization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to covertly collect sensitive user data and send it to an external server, exhibiting behavior characteristic of malware aimed at data theft. It does not include any user consent or notifications, strongly indicating malicious intent. The overall security risk is high.",
