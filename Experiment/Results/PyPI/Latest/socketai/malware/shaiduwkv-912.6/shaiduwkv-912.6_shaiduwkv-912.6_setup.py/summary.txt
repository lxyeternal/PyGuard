  "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of main() during installation poses a significant security concern, as it can run malicious code if main() is harmful. The pattern is a common tactic in malicious packages. Scores should reflect high suspicion, with malware and risk scores around 0.75, assuming untrusted source. The code is otherwise straightforward and not obfuscated. Caution is advised before installing or trusting such packages."
