  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that customizes the install process to execute a function from 'main' after installation.",
  "sources": "The import of 'main' inside the 'run' method of 'CrazyInstallStrat' class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during the installation process.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method calls 'install.run(self)' and then imports 'main' and executes it.",
  "anomalies": "The 'main' function is executed automatically after installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior if 'main' performs unintended actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that extends 'install'. During installation, it runs the standard install process and then imports and executes 'main()' from the 'main' module. This post-installation execution could be used maliciously to run arbitrary code. The setup configuration specifies package details but no suspicious dependencies or configurations. The 'install' method override is a common pattern for malicious post-install scripts. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present, but the automatic execution of 'main()' is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious behavior by executing 'main()' during installation without user consent. This could be used to run malicious code at install time. The rest of the setup code appears normal, but the post-install execution is a security concern.",
