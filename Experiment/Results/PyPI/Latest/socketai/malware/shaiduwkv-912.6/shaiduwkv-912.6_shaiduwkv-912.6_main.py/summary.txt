  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious external domains, indicative of malicious or spyware-like behavior. It is not obfuscated and contains no malicious payloads beyond data transmission. The activity warrants high security concern and a malware score of approximately 0.75, with a high risk score (~0.8). The behavior aligns with malicious exfiltration or tracking activities, making it potentially dangerous in supply chain contexts."
