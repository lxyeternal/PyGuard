  "flows": "System info sources → URL construction with parameters → HTTP GET request to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Sends hostname, username, and current directory to external servers; URLs appear suspicious and are likely used for tracking or data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and generates a random number. It then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP requests to three suspicious domains. The purpose appears to be data collection or tracking. The URLs are obfuscated and likely used for malicious monitoring. No code injection or data leakage beyond HTTP requests is observed. No suspicious use of environment variables or insecure functions beyond data exfiltration. The behavior resembles tracking or a malicious supply chain component designed to harvest user data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be used for malicious data exfiltration or tracking, sending system details to suspicious domains. While it does not contain direct malware like file damage or reverse shells, its purpose to send system info to untrusted servers indicates malicious intent.",
