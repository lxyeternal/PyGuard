  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with system info as URL parameters",
  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current directory, random number) collected from sources -> encoded into URL -> sent over HTTP GET request to external domains",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external domains, sending system info without user consent, reliance on hardcoded URLs with obfuscated-looking domain names, dynamic URL construction with parameters including hostname, username, current directory, and a random number",
  "analysis": "The code gathers basic system identifiers such as hostname, username, current working directory, and a random number, then constructs URLs to send this information via HTTP GET requests. The URLs used are suspicious, resembling domains associated with potential command and control or malicious data collection infrastructure. The code operates without user consent and could be part of a tracking or exfiltration mechanism. The code structure is straightforward and does not appear obfuscated or malicious beyond data collection and transmission, which itself could be malicious if done without authorization. No sensitive data like passwords or environment variables are accessed. The usage of try-except blocks handles network errors, but the purpose of data exfiltration is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be designed for covertly collecting system information and transmitting it to external domains, which suggests malicious intent or at least malicious potential. It does not contain obfuscation but performs suspicious data exfiltration activity. The code poses a security concern due to potential unauthorized data collection.",
