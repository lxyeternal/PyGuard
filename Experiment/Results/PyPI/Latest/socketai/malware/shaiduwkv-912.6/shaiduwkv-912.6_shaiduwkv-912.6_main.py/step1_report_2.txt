  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() (sending data to remote URLs)",
  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current path, random number) -> URL parameters -> remote server via urlopen()",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious URLs, sending system info without user consent, no validation or encryption of data, use of random number for request uniqueness, lack of error handling transparency",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, current directory, and a random number, then constructs URLs with these parameters. It sends HTTP GET requests to three different suspicious domains. The data transmission occurs unencrypted and unprotected, with no authentication or validation, indicating potential data exfiltration. The code does not perform any malicious system modifications but could be used for tracking or malicious reconnaissance. The URLs are suspicious and associated with malicious activity. The use of try-except logs errors but does not prevent data leakage. Overall, the code acts as a simple beacon or spyware module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely malicious or intended for malicious purposes, functioning as a tracking or data exfiltration script. It contacts suspicious domains and transmits system information without user consent or security measures.",
