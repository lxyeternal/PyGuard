      "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of main() during installation poses a significant security concern, as it can run malicious code if main() is harmful. The pattern is a common tactic in malicious packages. Scores should reflect high suspicion, with malware and risk scores around 0.75, assuming untrusted source. The code is otherwise straightforward and not obfuscated. Caution is advised before installing or trusting such packages."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious external domains, indicative of malicious or spyware-like behavior. It is not obfuscated and contains no malicious payloads beyond data transmission. The activity warrants high security concern and a malware score of approximately 0.75, with a high risk score (~0.8). The behavior aligns with malicious exfiltration or tracking activities, making it potentially dangerous in supply chain contexts."
