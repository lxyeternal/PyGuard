{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to serve as an initializer or entry point, exposing certain classes and enums for external use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ms, .enums, and .utils, which are likely internal modules of the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network operations, file writes, or execution of untrusted data within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flows from sources to sinks in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, primarily importing and exposing symbols. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enums from internal modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. There are no data processing, input handling, or external interactions. It functions as a module initializer, which is typical and safe in the context of package structure. No suspicious behavior or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export file, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply re-exports selected components for external use, indicating a normal, safe structure.",
