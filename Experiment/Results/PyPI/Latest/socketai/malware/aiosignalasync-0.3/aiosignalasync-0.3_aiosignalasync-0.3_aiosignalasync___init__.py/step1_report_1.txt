{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to be exporting specific classes and enumerations for use in a larger Python project, likely related to computations and utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ms, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data outputs or network calls present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified within this code; it is primarily an import/export declaration",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports components from local modules and defines an __all__ list for exports. This is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file or module initializer. No malicious behavior, external data handling, or suspicious logic is present. No signs of malware, malicious data exfiltration, or harmful behavior are detectable based on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export pattern with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any complex logic, external network interactions, or security-sensitive operations. Overall, it appears safe.",
