{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or export file, exposing specific classes, enums, and utilities for external use within a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports local modules (.ms, .enums, .utils).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leakage.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import/export pattern typical for a package's __init__.py. It imports specific classes and enums from local modules and defines __all__ for symbol exposure. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0-0.1) are consistent with its benign nature. Given the simplicity and clarity, the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export pattern with no malicious or security-sensitive issues. The scores and assessments across the reports are accurate and justified.",
