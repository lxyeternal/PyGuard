  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and enumerations from local package submodules for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from .ms, .enums, and .utils submodules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data is being processed or transmitted in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; this is a static import structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs imports and defines __all__, serving as an interface. It does not contain any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing that could be malicious. All imported modules are relative and presumed to be part of the same package. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module import declaration with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a component of a larger codebase, with no evidence of supply chain threats or malware in this fragment.",
