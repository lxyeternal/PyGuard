  "purpose": "Defines an abstract class for a data sender with methods for data retrieval, sending, and SSL configuration management.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (__get_sender_data, run), class attributes (__zip_name, __data, __preview), imported modules (ssl, BytesIO, SenderConfig, MultipartFormDataEncoder).",
  "sinks": "The static method _create_unverified_https() which globally disables SSL verification, affecting network security.",
  "flows": "Calling _create_unverified_https() overrides the default SSL context, affecting all subsequent HTTPS connections within the process.",
  "anomalies": "The method _create_unverified_https() disables SSL certificate verification globally, which is a security concern but a common testing pattern; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structural abstract class with no direct data processing or network activity. The SSL bypass method is a security risk if misused but not malicious. No external input reading or data leaks are evident. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, security risk ~0.2-0.4) are consistent with the code's nature. The main concern is the insecure SSL method, which could be exploited if called in production, but on its own, it does not constitute malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign abstract template with a security concern regarding SSL verification disabling. It contains no malware or obfuscation. The primary risk is potential misuse of the SSL bypass, which warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent.",
