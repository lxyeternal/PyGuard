{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract template for sending data, with methods to retrieve data, send archive, and configure SSL settings.",
  "sources": "The code does not explicitly read external input; it defines class methods intended to be used with data inputs such as zip_name, data, and preview.",
  "sinks": "The method _create_unverified_https() modifies global SSL context to disable certificate validation, which affects network security if used.",
  "flows": "Potential flow involves calling run() with parameters, which would then involve data retrieval (__get_sender_data), sending (__send_archive), and SSL configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The _create_unverified_https() method disables SSL verification globally, which can be exploited if misused, but by itself it is a standard pattern for ignoring SSL cert issues.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with methods for data retrieval and sending, and a static method to disable SSL verification. No direct malicious activity or code injection is present. The disabling of SSL certificate validation could pose security risks if misused but is a common pattern in testing or controlled environments. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard for encoding and configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard abstract template for data transmission, with a method to disable SSL verification. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware, though the SSL bypass should be used cautiously. Overall security risk is low, with the main concern being the unsafe SSL configuration if misapplied.",
