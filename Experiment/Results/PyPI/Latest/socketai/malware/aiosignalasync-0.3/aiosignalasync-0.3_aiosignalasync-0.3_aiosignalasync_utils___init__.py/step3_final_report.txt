{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing specific classes from local modules and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports classes from local modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py module that imports classes from local modules and defines __all__ for API exposure. It contains no functions, data processing, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation. The code's purpose is purely organizational, serving as a standard module setup. Given the absence of suspicious patterns or external interactions, the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious or security concerns. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
