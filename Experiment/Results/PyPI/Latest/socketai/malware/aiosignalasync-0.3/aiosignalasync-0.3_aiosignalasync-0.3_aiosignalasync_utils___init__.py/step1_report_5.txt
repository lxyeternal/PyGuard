{
  "purpose": "The code defines module exports for a Python package by importing specific classes from local modules and exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; import statements themselves do not constitute sinks",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to sensitive sinks; simply importing classes and exporting them",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors; minimal structure suggests straightforward module export",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and an __all__ declaration, establishing public API for the package. No processing, data handling, or external communication occurs. The modules imported could contain malicious code, but this snippet itself does not exhibit any malicious behavior or anomalies. There is no evidence of code injection, backdoors, or other security risks within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard module export pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It serves to organize and expose classes from local modules.",
