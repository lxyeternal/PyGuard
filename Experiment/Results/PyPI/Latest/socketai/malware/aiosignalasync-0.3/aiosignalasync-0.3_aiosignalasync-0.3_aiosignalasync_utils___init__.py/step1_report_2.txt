  "purpose": "This code appears to be an __init__.py file that imports and exposes specific classes from local modules for package initialization and API definition.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows to external untrusted sources are present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; it only re-exports classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns are observed",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes from local modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. No code execution, user input handling, or external data interaction is present. It appears to be a standard module initializer with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an interface for module components without any malicious or security-related concerns.",
