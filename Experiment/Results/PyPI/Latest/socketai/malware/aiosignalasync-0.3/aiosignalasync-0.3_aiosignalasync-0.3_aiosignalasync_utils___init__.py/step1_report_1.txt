  "purpose": "This code defines an __all__ list for module exports, importing specific classes from local modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data processing or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only module imports and exports are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of straightforward import statements and an export list, with no unusual language features, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes named Autostart, Message, Loader, Protector, and Grabber from local modules, then exports them via __all__. There are no functions, data processing, user inputs, or network interactions. It appears to be standard module setup code. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module initializer with no malicious intent or security issues. It functions solely to organize and export classes, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
