{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports specific classes from local submodules and defines an export list for a larger package.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute potentially dangerous operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; no flow analysis needed",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements and an export list; no suspicious or unusual code patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from local modules and defines __all__ for export, which is typical for Python package modules. No code execution, data handling, or obfuscated logic is present. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module functions as a simple interface for importing and exporting classes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
