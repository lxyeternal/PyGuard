  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module initializer that imports specific classes from local submodules and defines what symbols to export.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules: .autostart, .message, .loader, .protector, .grabber",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no execution of untrusted data or external code.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as there is only import and export statements; no runtime data handling or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code only manages module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from sibling modules and declares exports. There are no data processing, input handling, or network operations. No signs of malicious code or obfuscation. It appears to be standard package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module export file with no malicious behavior or security risks. It merely re-exports classes for use elsewhere.",
