  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project with explicit dependencies.",
  "sources": "Dependencies listed in 'install_requires' and package definitions via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or external data sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static dependency declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script utilizing setuptools. It explicitly lists dependencies with fixed versions, avoiding dynamic code execution or obfuscation. No external data sources, user inputs, or runtime behaviors are present. All dependencies are common packages, and the script solely defines package metadata and dependencies. Static analysis indicates no malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The consistency across multiple reports confirms the benign nature, with all assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0 and high confidence. The code's static, transparent structure supports these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The dependency list and static configuration pose no supply chain threat. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
