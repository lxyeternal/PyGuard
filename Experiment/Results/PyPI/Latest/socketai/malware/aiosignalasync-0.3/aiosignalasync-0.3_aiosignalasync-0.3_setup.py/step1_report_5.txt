{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'aiosignalasync', defining its dependencies and packages for installation.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from static strings defining package metadata and dependency lists.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not execute untrusted data or perform network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external inputs to sinks; dependencies are hardcoded, and no dynamic code execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard setup script with explicit package dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata and a list of required dependencies. All dependencies are statically defined with specific versions. The code structure is typical for Python package distribution and contains no dynamic code, user inputs, or external data sources. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behaviors are evident. There are no hidden or suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with explicit, static dependency declarations. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
