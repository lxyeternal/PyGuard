{
  "purpose": "This script is used for packaging a Python project, specifying dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "The 'install_requires' list specifies external package dependencies; 'setup()' reads package configuration.",
  "targets": "No specific untrusted data sources are present; dependencies are hardcoded in the script.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static configuration for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with package metadata and dependencies. All dependencies are explicitly listed with fixed versions, with no dynamic execution or external data reading. The structure and content follow standard Python packaging practices without signs of malicious intent or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, containing no malicious code or security risks. It merely declares dependencies and package info, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
