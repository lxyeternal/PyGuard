{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'aiosignalasync', including dependencies and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Static dependency list in 'install_requires' and package discovery via 'find_packages()'. No external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no code executes or processes untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only sets up package metadata and dependencies without runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected. All dependencies are specified with fixed versions, and the setup process is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It declares fixed version dependencies, which is typical for reproducible builds. No dynamic code execution, data processing, or external input reading is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors. The dependencies listed are common libraries, with no suspicious or malicious entries. Overall, the code appears to be a normal setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies without executing any untrusted or malicious code.",
