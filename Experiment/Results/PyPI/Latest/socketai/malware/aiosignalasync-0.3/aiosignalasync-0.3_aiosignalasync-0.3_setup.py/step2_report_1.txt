  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- Dependencies are explicitly listed with fixed versions, which is good practice for supply chain security.\n- No external data sources, user inputs, or runtime behaviors are involved.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are identified.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code matches the original code provided.\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, with confidence scores of 1.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the benign assessment.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, with no assumptions or claims that seem unwarranted.\n- The fixed dependency versions, while generally good, could be a minor concern if the dependencies themselves are compromised, but that is outside the scope of this static review.\n- No code execution or runtime behaviors are involved that could introduce malicious activity.\n\n**Scores Adjustment:**\n- The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the evidence.\n- Since no malicious or obfuscated elements are present, there's no justification to raise these scores.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The setup script is standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, or external data flows supports a malware score of 0.\n- The fixed dependencies do not indicate malicious behavior but are a standard practice for reproducibility.\n- The overall security risk remains negligible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The initial assessments are accurate.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n- The code appears safe, with no supply chain security concerns based on the provided static analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' consensus and the static nature of the code.",
