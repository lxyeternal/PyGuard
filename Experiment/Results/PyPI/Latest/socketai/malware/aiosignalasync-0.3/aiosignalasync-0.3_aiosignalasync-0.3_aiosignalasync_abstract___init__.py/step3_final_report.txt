  "purpose": "Minimal Python module exporting the AbstractSender class from a local sender module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .sender import AbstractSender",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and contains no dynamic execution, data handling, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and declares it as part of the public API via __all__. It contains no logic, data processing, external communication, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this minimal module. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
