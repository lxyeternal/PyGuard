  "conclusion": "The code employs persistence and stealth techniques that are common in malware but can also be used legitimately. The current scores in the reports are generally appropriate, though slightly underestimating the malicious potential. A malware score of approximately 0.5 and a security risk of 0.6 best reflect the observed behaviors and their potential misuse."
