  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward but inherently risky. It can be exploited to download and execute malicious code from untrusted sources. The silent error handling and use of shell=True amplify security concerns. While not malicious by itself, its design makes it a high-risk component in supply chain security, capable of facilitating malware deployment."
