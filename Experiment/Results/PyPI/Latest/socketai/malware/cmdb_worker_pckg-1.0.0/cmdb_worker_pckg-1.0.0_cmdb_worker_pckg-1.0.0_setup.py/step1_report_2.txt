  "purpose": "Customize package installation to perform a network lookup involving the current user's username and hostname, possibly for tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "os.popen() executing a nslookup command with base64-encoded user and hostname data",
  "flows": "Data from socket.gethostname() and getpass.getuser() flows into string formatting, then into base64 encoding, which is used in an os.popen() call to perform an nslookup query.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of os.popen() to execute a command that encodes user and hostname data in base64 and queries a suspicious domain 'tnclzdakriptzmhikqzyjbi9hzhnt0ord.oast.fun'. This pattern suggests covert data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity. No other obvious malicious code such as data theft or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the setuptools installation process by defining a custom install command. During installation, it retrieves the current system's hostname and username, formats this data into a string, encodes it in base64, and executes a network query (nslookup) to a domain that appears suspicious. The use of base64 encoding and executing network requests during setup is suspicious, potentially indicating an attempt to silently gather system info or establish contact with a malicious domain. The domain 'oast.fun' is known to be used in security testing environments, but its presence here in a package setup is unusual and could be malicious or tracking-related.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs a seemingly benign package setup routine but includes covert operations that gather system information and perform network lookups to a suspicious domain. This behavior suggests potential malicious intent or at least suspicious tracking activity embedded within the installation process.",
