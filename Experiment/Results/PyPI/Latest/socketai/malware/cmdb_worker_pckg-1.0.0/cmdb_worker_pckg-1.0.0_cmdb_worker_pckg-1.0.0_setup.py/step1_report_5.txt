  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to perform a network lookup involving system information.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname with socket.gethostname(), retrieving username with getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "os.popen() executing a shell command with a base64-encoded string that triggers a network lookup",
  "flows": "System information (username and hostname) is formatted, encoded in base64, then used in a shell command that performs a DNS query",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a base64 encoding of system info and uses it in a suspicious nslookup command directed at a specific domain, indicating potential data exfiltration or command-and-control communication",
  "analysis": "The script extends the setuptools install process with a custom class. During installation, it gathers system hostname and username, formats them into a string, encodes that string in base64, and constructs a shell command that performs an nslookup on the encoded data appended to a domain. The use of os.popen() to run this command suggests an attempt to send system info covertly via DNS query. No other malicious or suspicious code (like hardcoded credentials or file manipulations) is present. The purpose appears to be covert data exfiltration or remote command control via DNS queries.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior involving gathering system info and performing network requests that could be used for malicious data exfiltration or remote control. It appears to be intentionally designed to hide its activities through encoding and indirect DNS lookup. This pattern is characteristic of potential malicious activity.",
