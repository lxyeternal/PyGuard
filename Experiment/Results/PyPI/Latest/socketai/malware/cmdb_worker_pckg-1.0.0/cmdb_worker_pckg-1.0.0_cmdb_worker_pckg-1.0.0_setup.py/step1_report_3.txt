  "anomalies": "Encoding system info in base64 and querying a suspicious domain during install, potential data exfiltration or reconnaissance behavior",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to execute additional code during package installation. It gathers system info (hostname and username), encodes this data in base64, and constructs a DNS lookup query directed at a non-standard domain. The DNS query involves the encoded data, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration. This behavior is unusual for a standard package and could be malicious or at least suspicious, especially if used without user consent. The code does not directly perform malicious actions like file modification or network exfiltration but uses DNS queries to potentially send information covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting system information and performing a DNS query with encoded data during installation. While it does not directly perform harmful actions, this pattern is commonly used for covert data collection or command and control signaling. It warrants caution and further review.",
