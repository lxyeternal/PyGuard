{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging the 'soultracker' Python library, including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description, static string definitions for name, version, description, author info, and package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly handles untrusted input or data flows; no external data or user input is processed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present in this setup script.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets beyond standard package metadata. 'author' as 'Anonymous' is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to configure package metadata, read a README file for description, and discover packages automatically. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The use of static strings and reading from a file does not present security risks. The author info being generic is suspicious but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign, serving only to prepare the package for distribution.",
