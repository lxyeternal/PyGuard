  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'soultracker' library.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description; static metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open()' without context manager; author listed as 'Anonymous'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static metadata, no dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscated code. The use of 'open()' without a context manager is common but not malicious. No suspicious patterns or external dependencies are present. The author being 'Anonymous' is unusual but not malicious. All signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, consistent with the analysis.",
