{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'soultracker'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description; reads package metadata such as name, version, description, author, and email from static values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data is transmitted or processed in a harmful manner.",
  "flows": "Static input data (package info) flows into setup configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() to read 'README.md' without exception handling, but this is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious code such as dynamic code execution, hidden network calls, or credential handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script utilizing setuptools to package a Python library. It reads package metadata and description from static sources. The only dynamic operation is opening a README file, which is typical. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation detected. No suspicious code constructs or external communications are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a normal, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
