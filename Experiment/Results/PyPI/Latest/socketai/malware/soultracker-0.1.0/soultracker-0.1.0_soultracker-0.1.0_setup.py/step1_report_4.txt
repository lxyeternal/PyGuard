  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'soultracker'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data into critical operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file into long_description during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'README.md' without validation or sanitization; minimal risk, standard practice in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then defines package metadata such as name, version, description, author info, and packages. It reads the README.md file to populate long_description, which is a common pattern in Python packaging. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no dynamic execution, no external network connections, or credential handling. The use of open() is safe here, as it's a standard pattern for including a README in package metadata. Overall, the script appears straightforward and benign, serving the purpose of packaging without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations typical in Python package distribution.",
