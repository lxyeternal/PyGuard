  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'soultracker' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'README.md' content into the 'long_description' parameter during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' without context management (no 'with' statement), which could cause resource leaks, but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks for a Python package. It reads the package's long description from 'README.md' and configures package metadata. The use of 'open' without a context manager is a common pattern but not inherently malicious. No external network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is primarily used for packaging purposes with no signs of malware or supply chain attacks.",
