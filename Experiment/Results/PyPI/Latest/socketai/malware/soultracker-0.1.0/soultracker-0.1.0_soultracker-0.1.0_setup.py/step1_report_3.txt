  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no user input or external data handling in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this code only performs static configuration without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read README.md without error handling could cause issues if file is missing, but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup for distribution with no dynamic or malicious behavior. It reads a file for description, specifies package requirements, and defines package metadata. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
