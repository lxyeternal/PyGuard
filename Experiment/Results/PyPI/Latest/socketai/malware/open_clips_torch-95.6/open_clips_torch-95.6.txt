      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is a significant security concern, as it could run malicious code if 'main.py' is compromised. The pattern is known to be exploited in supply chain attacks. The current scores are appropriate, but the potential severity warrants cautious interpretation. It is recommended to review 'main.py' before installation and avoid executing external code during setup unless necessary and verified."

      "conclusion": "The script performs covert data collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious intent. It is not obfuscated but exhibits behaviors typical of malware or spyware, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The activity poses significant privacy and security concerns, and the code should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious."
