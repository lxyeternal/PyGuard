  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools, custom class defining run method, and the call to main() inside run() method.",
  "sinks": "The call to main() within the CrazyInstallStrat class's run() method, which executes code during installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method executes, calling main() from main.py, which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class runs main() unconditionally during the install process, which is unusual and potentially risky. No validation or constraints are placed on main().",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools for package setup. A custom install command CrazyInstallStrat overrides run() to execute main() from main.py after installation. This behavior is atypical, as it runs arbitrary code during package installation, which can be exploited for malicious purposes if main.py contains malicious code. The package dependencies are standard ('requests', 'psutil') with no signs of obfuscation. The code lacks comments or checks, and automatically executing main() on install raises security concerns. Since main() could perform any action, including malicious ones, this pattern presents a potential supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious behavior by executing main() during installation, which can run arbitrary code. This is suspicious and can be exploited to introduce malicious actions during package installation. No explicit malicious code is evident, but the pattern itself is risky and unusual.",
