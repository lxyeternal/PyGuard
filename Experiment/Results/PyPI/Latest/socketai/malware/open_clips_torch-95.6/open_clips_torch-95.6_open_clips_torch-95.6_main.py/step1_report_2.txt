{
  "purpose": "The script collects system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and sends this data to a set of remote URLs via HTTP GET requests, with some data encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and generates a random number; gathers system info via platform, getpass, os, subprocess, base64.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests to external URLs with system data as URL parameters via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are encoded (MAC addresses in base64) and included as URL parameters, then sent via GET requests to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "The code communicates with suspicious external domains, potentially to exfiltrate system data. Uses hardcoded URLs that look malicious. Encodes MAC addresses in base64 without clear purpose, possibly for obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system identifiers and encodes MAC addresses in base64, then sends this data to multiple URLs that appear malicious or suspicious. It does not perform any validation or sanitization of data but simply transmits system info. The domains used are suspicious and not recognizable as legitimate services. The code does not include malicious code like reverse shells or data theft, but it performs unprompted data exfiltration, which is suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code or hardcoded credentials are present, but the purpose of data transmission to these domains suggests potential privacy violations or malicious tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and exfiltration to suspicious external servers, indicating malicious intent. It does not contain explicit malware such as backdoors or system damage, but its purpose and behavior are suspicious for a supply chain attack or privacy violation.",
