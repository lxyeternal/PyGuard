  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it via HTTP GET requests to specified URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network interfaces, and random.randint() for generating a number.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls where constructed URLs with system data and a random number are sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, MAC addresses, random number) are gathered and encoded; then combined into URL parameters, which are sent via urlopen() to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded external URLs with suspicious domains, encoding of MAC addresses (potential privacy leak), and multiple network requests to untrusted domains. No clear user consent or documentation is present. No input validation or encryption of data.",
  "analysis": "The script collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current directory. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and appends a random number to the request URL, likely to prevent caching. The code then sends this data via GET requests to three external URLs, which are suspicious and potentially malicious, indicating data exfiltration. No data validation, encryption, or user consent mechanisms are present. The URLs and the data collection behavior suggest potential privacy invasion and malicious intent, such as tracking or unauthorized data collection. The code itself does not contain obfuscated constructs but does engage in potentially malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and transmits it to suspicious external domains without user consent, indicating malicious behavior and privacy violation. The URLs used are suspicious, and the data transmission pattern resembles covert data exfiltration. Overall, this code has a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
