{
  "purpose": "The script collects system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and transmits this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple suspicious external URLs, likely for covert data exfiltration or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system interfaces, and the URL parameters constructed with system info and encoded MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls sending HTTP GET requests with system data to external domains, potentially leading to data leakage or privacy violations.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info and encoded MAC addresses) are incorporated into URL parameters, which are then sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs, representing source-to-sink data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious external URLs, encoding MAC addresses in base64 (possibly for fingerprinting), lack of user consent or validation, silent exception handling, and straightforward code structure without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system information and transmits it covertly to external domains without user consent. It uses platform-specific commands to retrieve MAC addresses, encodes them in base64, and constructs URLs with these parameters. The URLs are suspicious and likely malicious. The code does not obfuscate its intent and lacks error handling or validation, indicating malicious or at least highly suspicious activity. The data exfiltration pattern, combined with the suspicious domains, suggests malicious reconnaissance or privacy invasion. The code's behavior aligns with malware-like activity, although it does not contain payloads like reverse shells or system damage. The activity warrants high malware and security risk scores, consistent with the observed behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs covert data collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious intent. It is not obfuscated but exhibits behaviors typical of malware or spyware, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The activity poses significant privacy and security concerns, and the code should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious.",
