  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (reading MAC addresses), the URLs for data exfiltration, and the random number generation.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send data to external malicious URLs with embedded parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current path, MAC addresses) is collected, encoded, and sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs with parameters, using the generated random number as part of the URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external URLs (likely malicious command and control or data collection servers). Base64-encoding of MAC addresses, which might be used for evasion or tracking. No user-visible output or logs. No user interaction required. The URLs and data collection behavior are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data to three external domains via GET requests. The URLs appear suspicious and potentially malicious, designed for tracking or exfiltration. The use of random numbers in URLs could be for session tracking or avoiding detection. No explicit malicious functions like reverse shells or file access are present, but the data collection and transmission behavior is consistent with malicious telemetry or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs covert collection and exfiltration of system information to suspicious domains, which is indicative of malicious intent. The code itself appears intentionally designed to harvest device data and send it externally without user consent. Overall, it poses a significant security risk.",
