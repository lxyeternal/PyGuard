  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() - gathering hostname, current working directory, and username",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with external URL - sending collected data over the network",
  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> collected into 'ploads' -> requests.get() to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of requests during installation to send system info without user consent; no validation or user notification; sending data to suspicious external domain",
  "analysis": "The code extends the setuptools install command to include a network request sending system info to an external domain during installation. It captures hostname, current directory, and username and transmits these via an HTTP GET request. This behavior occurs transparently during package setup, which is suspicious. The external URL is obscure and could be used for malicious data collection. The try-except block suppresses errors, potentially hiding issues or malicious activity. The code does not appear to perform any malicious system modification but performs unauthorized data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by silently collecting and exfiltrating system information during package installation to an external domain. This constitutes a privacy violation and potential security risk.",
