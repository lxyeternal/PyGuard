{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to a specified URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "Sends data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL (requests.get).",
  "flows": "Collects system info (source), then transmits it over the network to an external server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Data collection and transmission occur during the installation process without user consent, and the target URL appears suspicious. Use of exception handling suppresses errors silently. No hardcoded credentials, but data exfiltration is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon execution, gathers system hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external, potentially malicious domain. The process occurs automatically during package installation without explicit user approval, indicating potential malicious intent. The URL used is unusual and may be associated with a malicious server. The code handles exceptions silently, preventing detection of failures. Overall, this is a covert data exfiltration mechanism embedded in package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to automatic collection and transmission of system information to an external domain during package installation, indicating malicious behavior. It aims to stealthily exfiltrate user system data without consent, representing a security concern.",
