{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process for a Python package, during which it collects system information and sends it to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP GET request to an external domain ('https://ovnabqa0k6gt0vwzch7ovggkabg74xsm.oastify.com').",
  "flows": "System information is collected from sources and transmitted through the requests.get call to the specified external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of the requests library to send data during installation without user consent; external data exfiltration during package install is suspicious behavior. The external URL is a known OAST (Out-Of-Band) testing domain, indicating the data is being exfiltrated for testing or tracking.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install command to include additional behavior during package installation. It gathers system hostname, current directory, and username, then attempts to send this information via an HTTP GET request to an external URL. This behavior could be used for tracking or exfiltration without explicit user consent. The use of a non-standard URL suggests potential malicious or at least suspicious activity, particularly since it occurs silently during installation. The code handles exceptions gracefully, avoiding crashes, but the core behavior involves collecting and transmitting user environment data to an external server, which is a common trait of malicious packages. No other malicious code such as backdoors, file modification, or code execution is evident, but the data exfiltration itself is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes suspicious behavior by collecting user system info and sending it externally during installation, which could be used for malicious tracking or exfiltration. While no destructive actions are observed, the data collection is ethically questionable and potentially malicious.",
