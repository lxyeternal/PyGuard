{
  "purpose": "To define a setup configuration for a Python package with a custom install command that collects system information and sends it to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), and the requests.get() call to send data.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() which sends data over the network to an external server.",
  "flows": "System info collected from hostname, current directory, and username flows into the requests.get() as URL parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends system information to an external server during installation without user consent, which is suspicious. The target URL appears obscure and may be used for data exfiltration. The exception handling suppresses errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a custom installation class. During installation, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to an external URL via an HTTP GET request. The URL appears obfuscated and may serve malicious purposes such as data collection or C2 communication. Error handling only prints exceptions without safeguards or user notification. There are no input validation or security controls, and the network activity occurs silently during package installation, which is suspicious behavior indicating potential data exfiltration or malicious tracking.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains malicious behavior by collecting and exfiltrating system information during package installation. The external URL and silent data transmission suggest a possible security breach or malicious activity. It should be considered unsafe for deployment.",
