  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom install command to collect system information and send it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), requests.get() to the specified URL.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call sending data to a remote server, printing error messages.",
  "flows": "Upon installation, system info is collected (hostname, cwd, username) and sent via HTTP GET request to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system data during installation without user consent, which resembles data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The URL used is suspicious and likely malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, when executed, gathers system information such as hostname, current directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL with this data as parameters. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or reconnaissance, indicative of malicious intent. No other suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are detected. The setup script itself appears standard except for this hidden data transmission. No hardcoded credentials are present, but the intentional collection and transmission of system data during install is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by collecting and transmitting system information to an external, suspicious domain during package installation. This suggests malicious intent such as data theft or reconnaissance. The overall security risk is high, and this package should not be used.",
