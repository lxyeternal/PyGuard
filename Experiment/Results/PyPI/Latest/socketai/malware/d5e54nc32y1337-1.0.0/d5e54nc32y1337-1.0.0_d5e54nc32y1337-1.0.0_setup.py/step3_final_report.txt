{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current directory, username) during installation and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to an external, suspicious URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call sending data to external URL",
  "flows": "source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> data assembled into 'ploads' -> requests.get() to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Silent data exfiltration during package installation, broad exception handling hiding errors, use of obscure URL for data transmission",
  "analysis": "The code performs system info collection and exfiltration during setup without user consent, indicating malicious intent. The URL used is suspicious and likely for testing or malicious tracking. No obfuscation or hardcoded credentials are present. The network activity during install is a security concern, and the broad exception handling may mask malicious activity. The behavior aligns with malicious supply chain tactics, such as covert data theft. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the exfiltration activity is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by silently collecting and transmitting system information during installation to an external, suspicious URL. This indicates high malicious intent and security risk, warranting a malware score close to 1. The code is not obfuscated. Overall, the package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious.",
