{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and installing the 'pnuske' Python package with a command-line entry point.",
  "sources": "Import statement for setuptools, and the 'setup' function parameters including package discovery and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no code execution, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only defines package metadata and entry points without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup.py structure with no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' to define package metadata including name, version, and packages. It specifies an entry point for a console script 'pnuske' linked to 'pnuske:run'. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. The structure is typical for Python package setup scripts. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script appears to be a normal, benign package configuration with no malicious intent. It follows standard packaging practices and does not contain any suspicious code or malicious behaviors.",
