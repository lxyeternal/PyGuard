  "purpose": "Configure the package setup for distribution, including package discovery and entry point definition.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, call to setup() with package info and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in this code; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this is a setup configuration script without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools to facilitate package setup. It defines package metadata such as name and version, discovers packages automatically, and specifies a console script entry point that executes the 'run' function within the 'pnuske' module. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The script appears to be a typical Python package configuration file without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script used for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and poses no security risks. It simply defines how to build and install the package with a command-line entry point.",
