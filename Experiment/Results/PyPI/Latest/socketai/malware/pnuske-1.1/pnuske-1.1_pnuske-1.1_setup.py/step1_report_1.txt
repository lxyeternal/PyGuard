  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'pnuske' Python module, enabling installation and command-line entry point.",
  "sources": "The script reads package configuration details, including package discovery and entry point definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or sensitive operations are evident.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flow from package discovery to defining a console script entry point.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setuptools usage. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools functions to configure package metadata and entry points. It specifies the package name 'pnuske', version '1.1', and automatically finds packages in the source directory. It defines a console script 'pnuske' that executes the 'run' function from the 'pnuske' module. All elements are typical for Python package setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with a command-line interface. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
