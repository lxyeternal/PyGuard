  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata, discovering packages, and setting up a console script entry point.",
  "sources": "Package metadata definitions, find_packages() for package discovery, entry_points for CLI script",
  "sinks": "Execution of pnuske:run function via CLI, no untrusted data handling or external inputs",
  "flows": "CLI invocation triggers pnuske:run; no data flows or external data processing present",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; straightforward setup script",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py using setuptools, with no malicious or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no anomalies or obfuscation. The entry point 'pnuske=pnuske:run' is standard for CLI tools, and without inspecting the 'pnuske' module, no malicious activity can be inferred. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's content. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident, and the code aligns with best practices for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. All reports are accurate, and their scores are justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
