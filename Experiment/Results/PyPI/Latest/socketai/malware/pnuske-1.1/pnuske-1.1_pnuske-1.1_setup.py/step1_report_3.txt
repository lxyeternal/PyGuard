  "sinks": "No direct sinks; standard setup process",
  "flows": "Not applicable; standard packaging process with no data flows involving untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code detected; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code uses 'setuptools' to define a package setup with a name, version, package discovery, and a console script entry point. There are no external inputs, environmental variables, or dynamic code execution. The code follows standard packaging conventions and does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic. It appears to be a straightforward setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
