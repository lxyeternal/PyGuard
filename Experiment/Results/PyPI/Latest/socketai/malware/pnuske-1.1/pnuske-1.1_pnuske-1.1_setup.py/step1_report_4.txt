  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'pnuske' Python project.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function parameters, including package discovery and entry points.",
  "sinks": "Entry point definition which executes 'pnuske:run', potentially invoking user-defined code.",
  "flows": "Entry point 'pnuske=pnuske:run' indicates execution of 'run' function within 'pnuske' module when command-line tool is used.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code structures. Usage of standard setuptools functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package the project. It specifies the package name, version, and automatically finds packages in the directory. The entry point 'pnuske=pnuske:run' registers a console script that executes the 'run' function from the 'pnuske' module. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or unusual patterns are evident. The script's simplicity and adherence to common packaging practices suggest it is a benign setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with a console entry point. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks based on the provided code. It appears safe and intended for standard packaging purposes.",
