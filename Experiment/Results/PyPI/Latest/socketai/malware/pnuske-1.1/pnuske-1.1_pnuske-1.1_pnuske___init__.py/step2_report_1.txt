  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Actual Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement: `from .main import run`.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data flows.\n   - The code snippet is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n   - No logical flaws are evident; the assessments are appropriate for such a minimal code fragment.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - **Confidence scores** are mostly 0.9 or 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated scores** are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware scores** are 0, which aligns with the lack of malicious indicators.\n   - **SecurityRisk scores** are 0, which is justified since no security issues are apparent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - The minimal and benign nature of the code warrants a zero or near-zero risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - Since the code only imports a function from a local module, with no evidence of malicious behavior, the malware score should remain 0.\n   - Any claim of malware presence would require evidence of malicious code, which is absent here.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the lack of context and the benign nature of the code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation & Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall, the code is benign.** It is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Malware, obfuscated, and risk scores** should remain at **0** for this specific snippet.\n- **Confidence scores** are appropriate given the minimal context.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code fragment.",
