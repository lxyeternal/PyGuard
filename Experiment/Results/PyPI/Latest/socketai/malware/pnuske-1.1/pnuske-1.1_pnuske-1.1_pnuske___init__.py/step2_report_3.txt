  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**  \nAll reports describe a single import statement: `from .main import run`. This is a straightforward import of a function from a local module. There are no other code elements, data flows, or input/output operations described.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior and Anomalies**  \n- No reports identify any anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.  \n- The code is minimal, standard, and typical for modular Python projects.  \n- No signs of malware, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward import statement.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, justified given the lack of any suspicious activity or security issues.\n\n4. **Confidence Levels**  \nMost reports have high confidence (0.9 to 1), which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Overestimations**  \n- Since the code is just an import statement, the risk scores should remain low unless additional context suggests otherwise.  \n- No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are warranted here.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion**  \nThe code fragment is benign. All reports correctly identify it as a standard import with no security risks. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0.0.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep at 0.0.  \n- **Risk Score:** Keep at 0.0, as there's no evidence of risk.  \n\n### Additional Notes:\n- If future code introduces dynamic imports, code execution, or data handling, reassessment would be necessary.  \n- For now, the code fragment is safe and typical for Python projects.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.",
