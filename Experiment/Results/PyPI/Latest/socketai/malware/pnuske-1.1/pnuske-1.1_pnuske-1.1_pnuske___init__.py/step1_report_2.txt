{
  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from the local 'main' module, likely to execute or utilize its functionality elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module, no external data input or reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs observed; the code does not perform any actions beyond importing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement importing 'run' from a local module '.main'. This indicates modular design but provides no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. No data input, output, or execution of untrusted code is present. The code fragment is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing a simple import with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is likely part of a larger application structure.",
