  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports describe a single line: `from .main import run`. This is a straightforward relative import of a function named `run` from a local module `main`. There are no other code elements, data flows, or input/output operations.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**  \n- The code is minimal, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.  \n- No data flows from untrusted sources, no sinks, and no execution of untrusted code.  \n- The reports correctly identify that this snippet alone is benign and part of a larger codebase.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign.  \n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.  \n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, which is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**  \n- Since the code only performs an import, without any execution or data handling, there's no basis for higher risk scores.  \n- The reports do not assume malicious intent; they recognize the code as benign.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**  \nGiven the minimal, benign nature of this code snippet, I agree with the reports' conclusions. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code fragment appears entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Note:** If future code snippets or context reveal more complex behavior, reassessment would be necessary.",
