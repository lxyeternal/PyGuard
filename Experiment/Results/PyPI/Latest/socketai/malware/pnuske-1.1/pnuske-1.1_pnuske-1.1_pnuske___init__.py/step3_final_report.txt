  "purpose": "Minimal import statement from a local module, likely part of a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statement `from .main import run`",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "None; the code only performs an import without further data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of a function from a local module. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The minimal nature and lack of data flows or external interactions indicate a benign component. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero. Confidence is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports correctly identify the nature of the code, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
