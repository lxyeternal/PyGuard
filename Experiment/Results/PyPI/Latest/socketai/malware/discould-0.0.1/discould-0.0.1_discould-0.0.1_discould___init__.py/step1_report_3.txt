{
  "purpose": "The script downloads an executable file from a remote URL and then runs it silently on the local machine.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/Anch.exe' used with curl.exe for downloading the file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded executable via PowerShell's Start-Process command.",
  "flows": "Download command retrieves the executable from the remote URL, then the script executes the downloaded file directly.",
  "anomalies": "Directly executing a downloaded file without validation, using hardcoded URL and filename, and downloading an executable from an unverified source. The file name 'Anch.exe' and URL suggest potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads an executable from a remote URL using PowerShell's curl, then executes it silently. There are no checks for file integrity, signature verification, or user consent. The process appears designed to run arbitrary code without user interaction. The URL points to a raw GitHub link, which could host malicious content. The code does not include any obfuscation or encryption, but the behavior—downloading and executing an external binary—is typical of malware or supply chain attacks. The use of subprocess with PowerShell commands for download and execution is common in malicious scripts to evade simple detection.",
  "conclusion": "This code is potentially malicious. It downloads and executes an external executable without verification, which is a common tactic in malware deployment. The behavior suggests a high risk of malicious intent, especially given the direct execution of an external payload from an untrusted source.",
