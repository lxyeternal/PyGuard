  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static strings in setup() parameters: name, version, author, description, packages.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Description field set to 'None' as a string instead of an empty string or omitted; unusual but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static setup script for a Python package, with all parameters hardcoded. No dynamic code, external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The description being 'None' as a string is unconventional but not malicious. Multiple reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and very low security risk. The minor anomaly does not impact security assessment. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its static, straightforward nature.",
