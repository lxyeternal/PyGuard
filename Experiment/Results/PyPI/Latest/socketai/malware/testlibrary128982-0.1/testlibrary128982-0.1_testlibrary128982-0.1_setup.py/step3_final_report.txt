  "purpose": "Define package metadata for a Python library using static configuration.",
  "sources": "Static strings within the setup() call and find_packages() function.",
  "sinks": "None; no external input or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Static data assigned directly to setup() parameters without dynamic or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; author email appears as a placeholder but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script that imports setuptools functions and calls setup() with hardcoded, static package information. It does not process external data, execute dynamic code, or contain obfuscated or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, safe code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
