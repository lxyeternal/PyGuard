{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup parameters for a Python package named 'testlibrary128982'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data such as package name, version, author details, and dependencies directly from the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external inputs or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static configuration variables to the setup() function, which then prepares the package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present. The author email appears standard but is a common placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools and calls setup() with static parameters defining package metadata. There are no inputs from external sources, no environment variable reads, and no code execution beyond static configuration. The package details appear benign, intended solely for packaging purposes. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The script's sole purpose is to define package metadata, with no indications of malicious intent or security concerns.",
