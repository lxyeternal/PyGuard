  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'testlibrary128982' intended for test purposes.",
  "sources": "Static source data within the setup() function parameters such as package name, version, author details, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data sinks present; static configuration data only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration, no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of standard setup tools with no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration using setuptools to define package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. The code does not perform any file operations, network connections, or code execution beyond the straightforward package setup. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a typical package configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a benign and standard implementation for packaging a Python library.",
