  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'testlibrary128982'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings and package metadata within the setup() call; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to potential data leaks or malicious actions; no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code solely defines package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code appears straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata, including name, version, author info, and requirements. It does not process user input, fetch external data, or execute dynamic code. All strings are static and standard. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code's structure aligns with typical Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign package configuration file.",
