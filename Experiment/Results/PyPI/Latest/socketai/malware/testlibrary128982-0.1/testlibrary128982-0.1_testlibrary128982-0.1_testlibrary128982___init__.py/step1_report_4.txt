  "purpose": "Import and execute the main_function from a local module 'your_code'.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'main_function' from the module '.your_code'.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of main_function() is a sink where untrusted or malicious code could execute.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the import statement (source) to the execution of main_function() (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; however, the import from a local module with a generic name 'your_code' could be suspicious if the module contains malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a single function 'main_function' from a local module 'your_code' and then executes it. The structure is straightforward, with no obvious obfuscation or malicious constructs. The lack of context about 'your_code' makes it impossible to definitively assess the intent or safety of 'main_function'. The code itself does not perform any suspicious operations beyond calling an imported function.",
  "conclusion": "The code's behavior hinges on the contents of 'your_code'. Based solely on this snippet, there are no direct signs of malicious activity; however, the lack of visibility into the imported module's content means potential risks cannot be ruled out. Overall, this is a simple import-and-call pattern with no evident malicious behavior in this snippet alone.",
