  "purpose": "The code imports and executes 'main_function' from a local module 'your_code'.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .your_code, which loads code from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "The call to main_function(), which executes code from the imported module.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads 'your_code'; execution proceeds to run main_function() from that module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function from a local module and executes it. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data leakage, or obfuscated code. Since the source module 'your_code' is local, its behavior depends on its implementation, which is not provided here. Based solely on this snippet, no malicious or suspicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic invocation of a local module function. There are no apparent malicious behaviors or security risks evident from this snippet alone.",
