  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom .your_code import main_function\n\nmain_function()\n```\nThis is a minimal script that imports `main_function` from a local module `your_code` and executes it immediately.\n\n---\n\n### **General Observations:**\n- The code itself is straightforward and contains no suspicious patterns like obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or network activity.\n- The security risk and malware scores depend heavily on the contents of `your_code`, which is not provided.\n- The potential for malicious activity exists if `your_code` or `main_function` is compromised, but the code snippet alone cannot confirm this.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the import and execution.\n- **Analysis:** Appropriately notes that maliciousness depends on `your_code`.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.4, confidence=0.6.\n- **Comment:** The risk score seems slightly high given the minimal code, but since the module is external and untrusted, a moderate risk is justifiable.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; emphasizes that behavior depends on `your_code`.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.4.\n- **Comment:** Slightly lower risk, consistent with the minimal code.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that no suspicious activity is visible.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.8.\n- **Comment:** High confidence in benign nature; scores seem reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Reiterates that the code depends on `your_code`.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.4.\n- **Comment:** Consistent with the minimal and benign appearance.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Appropriately notes that the behavior depends on `main_function`.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.5.\n- **Comment:** Slightly higher confidence but still consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Evaluation & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code snippet. No evidence of malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All zero, which is correct.\n- **Risk Scores:** Vary from 0.1 to 0.4, reflecting the uncertainty and potential risk depending on the external module.\n\n**However, considering the totality:**\n- The code is minimal, and the security risk is primarily contingent on the content of `your_code`.\n- Without any signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns, the overall risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Scores should be consistent** with the assessment that the code itself is benign but carries inherent supply chain risk if `your_code` is compromised.\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 unless evidence suggests malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** Remains 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for supply chain issues, a moderate risk score (around 0.2-0.3) is appropriate, especially if the source of `your_code` is untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (moderate, depending on trustworthiness of `your_code`)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious or obfuscated behavior. The main concern is the trustworthiness of the external module `your_code`. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but I would suggest slightly lowering the security risk scores to reflect the minimal code and the dependency on external, unverified code.\n\n**Final note:** Always verify the contents of `your_code` before executing, especially in supply chain contexts.",
