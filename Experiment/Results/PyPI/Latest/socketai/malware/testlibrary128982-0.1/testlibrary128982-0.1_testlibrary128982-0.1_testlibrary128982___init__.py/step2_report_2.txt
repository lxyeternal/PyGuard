  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code snippet for reference:**\n```python\nfrom .your_code import main_function\n\nmain_function()\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code is minimal: it imports and executes a single function from a local module.\n- The actual behavior depends entirely on the implementation of `your_code.main_function`.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or suspicious patterns are visible.\n- The module `your_code` is not provided, making it impossible to assess the behavior of `main_function`.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the import and execution.\n- **Analysis:** Appropriately notes that maliciousness depends on `your_code`.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6 (moderate)\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.4\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The risk is moderate because executing external code always carries potential risk, but the code itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Also accurate, emphasizing dependence on `your_code`.\n- **Confidence:** 0.4 (lower confidence)\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The low risk score aligns with the minimal code snippet.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the code is benign in structure, risk depends on `your_code`.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 (high confidence)\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The high confidence is justified given the simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Similar reasoning, emphasizing that without inspecting `your_code`, no malicious activity can be inferred.\n- **Confidence:** 0.4\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Notes that behavior depends on `main_function` implementation, no immediate malicious signs.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign `0` because there's no evidence of malicious code in the snippet itself.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign `0`, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given that executing external code always bears some risk, a conservative approach would assign a low but non-zero risk score, especially since the actual behavior of `main_function` is unknown.\n\n**However,** the current scores are generally aligned with the code snippet's simplicity and the lack of suspicious patterns. The only point to consider is that executing external code from an untrusted source is inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Personal Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 to 0.3 — because executing external modules always carries some risk, even if the code looks benign.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0** | **0** | **0.2** |\n\nThis reflects that the code itself is safe, but the risk is non-zero due to dependency on external code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are generally accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- The main risk is the trustworthiness of `your_code`.\n- Without inspecting `your_code`, the best we can do is assign a low risk score.\n\n**Final note:** Always recommend verifying the contents of external modules before execution, especially in supply chain contexts.",
