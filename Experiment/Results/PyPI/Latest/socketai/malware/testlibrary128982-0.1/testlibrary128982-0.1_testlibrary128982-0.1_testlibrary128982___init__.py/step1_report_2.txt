{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes 'main_function' from a local module named 'your_code'.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .your_code import main_function' accesses a local module; 'main_function()' executes the imported function.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main_function()' is a sink where untrusted code could execute if 'main_function' is malicious.",
  "flows": "Code imports 'main_function' from a local module, then executes it directly.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; there are no obvious anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'main_function' from a local module using a relative import, then calls it. No additional logic, input handling, or external communications are present. Given the simplicity, potential malicious behavior depends entirely on the implementation of 'main_function' in 'your_code'. Without inspecting that module, it's impossible to definitively determine malicious intent. The code structure itself is standard and unremarkable. No signs of obfuscation, hidden behavior, or malicious patterns are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this fragment, the code appears benign. However, since it executes 'main_function' from a local module, the security depends on the contents of that module. No malicious behavior or anomalies are evident here.",
