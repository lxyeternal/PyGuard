{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the main_function from a local module 'your_code'.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .your_code import main_function' reads the local module 'your_code'.",
  "sinks": "The call to main_function() executes potentially untrusted code from that module.",
  "flows": "The code imports main_function from 'your_code' and executes it immediately, which could lead to execution of malicious code if 'your_code' is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; it only imports and runs main_function. The module 'your_code' is not provided, making the source of executed code opaque. No visible validation or sanitization is performed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple import and execution of main_function from a local module. It does not contain inline malicious code but relies entirely on the contents of 'your_code'. If 'your_code' is malicious or tampered with, executing main_function() could be harmful. The code structure itself is not suspicious, but it is potentially dangerous depending on the integrity of 'your_code'. No other suspicious patterns such as obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with the main risk depending on the contents of 'your_code'. Without additional context, the code itself does not exhibit malicious behavior, but executing external modules always carries potential risks if the modules are compromised.",
