  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom .your_code import main_function\n\nmain_function()\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code is minimal: it imports and executes `main_function` from a local module `your_code`.\n- The behavior entirely depends on the implementation of `your_code.main_function`.\n- No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no inline malicious code.\n- The code pattern is straightforward and common in modular Python projects.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies import and execution.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes that the risk depends on `your_code`. No malicious behavior detected in the snippet.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0.4`, confidence=0.6.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The risk is moderate due to reliance on external code, but no evidence of malicious activity. The malware score is correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the import and execution.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same reasoning as Report 1, emphasizing that behavior depends on `your_code`.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0.2`, confidence=0.4.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. The lower security risk score reflects less concern, which seems justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Similar reasoning; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0.1`, confidence=0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher confidence but still no evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes that the behavior depends on `your_code`, but no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0.2`, confidence=0.4.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as others; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0.1`, confidence=0.5.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code's risk hinges on the implementation of `your_code.main_function`.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns in the snippet.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero, which is justified given the lack of malicious indicators.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal code and the dependency on external code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** across all reports unless additional context suggests malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly at **0**; no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the potential for malicious code in `your_code`, a risk score of around **0.2 to 0.3** might be more appropriate than the current 0.1–0.4 range, especially if the external module's integrity cannot be guaranteed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** **0** (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (moderate, depending on trust in `your_code`)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are reasonable, and the scores are appropriate given the information. The primary concern remains the trustworthiness of `your_code`, which cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always verify the contents of `your_code` before executing, especially in supply chain contexts. The code pattern itself is benign.",
