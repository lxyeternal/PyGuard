  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code imports main_function from a local module and executes it immediately. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The security implications depend entirely on the contents of your_code. The code itself appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score is set to 0, and the security risk is low, reflecting reliance on external code. Confidence is high that the snippet is benign, but the risk depends on trustworthiness of your_code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and straightforward; no malicious or obfuscated behavior detected. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of your_code, which cannot be assessed from this snippet. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate due to external dependency risks.",
