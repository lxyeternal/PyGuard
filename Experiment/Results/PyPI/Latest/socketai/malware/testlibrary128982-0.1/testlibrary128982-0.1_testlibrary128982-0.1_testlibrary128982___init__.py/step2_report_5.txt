  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code simply imports and executes `main_function` from a local module `your_code`.\n- None of the reports provide the implementation of `your_code`, so assessment of malicious behavior relies entirely on assumptions.\n- The code is minimal, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns within the snippet itself.\n- The main concern is the trustworthiness of `your_code` and whether `main_function` could be malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** The code is straightforward; no issues are visible within this snippet.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors or flaws are evident in the code snippet itself.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware score: all zero, which aligns with the code snippet's simplicity.\n  - Security risk: low, as the code does not perform any risky operations itself.\n  - Obfuscated: all zero, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Potentially malicious behavior:** Cannot be determined without inspecting `your_code`.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.4\n- **Assessment:** The high securityRisk score (0.4) seems slightly overestimated given the code's simplicity; it depends on the contents of `your_code`. Without evidence, a lower score might be more appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly states the risk depends on `your_code`. The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score seems reasonable, given the minimal code and no visible malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The confidence level is 0.4, which is fair; the assessment aligns with the code.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score; this is consistent with the benign appearance.\n- **Conclusion:** The confidence is high (0.8), but the risk remains low, which is appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, appropriate given the lack of evidence.\n- **Conclusion:** The report emphasizes that risk depends on `your_code`, which is correct.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the minimal, benign code.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Malware Score Justification:\n- All reports assign malware=0, which is justified because the code itself does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n- The risk depends on the content of `your_code`, which is unknown.\n\n### Obfuscated Score:\n- All zero, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable given the code snippet.\n- The main concern remains the trustworthiness of `your_code`. If this were a real supply chain incident, the critical factor is whether `your_code` has been compromised.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0, since no malicious activity is visible.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2, reflecting that executing external code always carries some risk, but no evidence here.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code itself is benign; the potential risk hinges entirely on the integrity of `your_code`.\n- The scores assigned across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No changes are necessary unless additional context about `your_code` is provided.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThis cautious approach reflects that the code snippet is simple and not malicious by itself, but always depends on external modules' trustworthiness.",
