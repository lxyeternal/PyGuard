  "purpose": "Import and execute the main_function from a local module called your_code.",
  "sources": "The code imports main_function from the local module your_code.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main_function could lead to potential data leakage, system modification, or malicious activity depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Importing your_code -> calling main_function()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function from a local module and executes it. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious patterns visible in this snippet. However, the behavior entirely depends on what main_function does, which is not provided. Without the implementation of main_function, potential malicious activity cannot be ruled out, but based on this code alone, there are no obvious indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign in appearance; it merely executes a function from a local module. The security implications depend on the implementation of main_function, which is not visible here. No immediate malicious behavior or supply chain risk is evident from this snippet alone.",
