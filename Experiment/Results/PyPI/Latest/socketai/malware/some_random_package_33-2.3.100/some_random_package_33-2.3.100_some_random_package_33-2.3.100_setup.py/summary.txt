  "conclusion": "This setup script contains obfuscated eval() execution during package setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior and supply chain attack. It should be treated as malicious, flagged, and removed from repositories. The high scores are justified by the obfuscation and potential for arbitrary code execution."
