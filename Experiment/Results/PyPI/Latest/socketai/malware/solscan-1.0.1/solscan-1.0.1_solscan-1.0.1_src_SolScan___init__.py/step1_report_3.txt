  "purpose": "Initialize runtime asynchronously and expose core functionalities and utilities.",
  "sources": "runtime() function from ._config, imported modules (.core, .utils)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations",
  "flows": "runtime() called in _background_init() which is scheduled asynchronously; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks",
  "anomalies": "The code uses asyncio to run an initialization asynchronously; no suspicious or unusual code structures or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core modules and utility functions, then defines an async function to initialize runtime. It checks if an asyncio event loop is running: if not, it starts a new loop to run _background_init(); if yes, it schedules the init function to run in the existing loop via run_coroutine_threadsafe. No input or output data handling, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials or malicious code. The code structure is standard for asynchronous initialization in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard asynchronous runtime initialization without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data handling. Overall, it appears safe and intended for asynchronous setup.",
