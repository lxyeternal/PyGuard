  "purpose": "Initialize runtime asynchronously upon import and expose specific functions and classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements for core, utils, and configuration modules; runtime() invocation within _background_init()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data is being sent over network, written to files, or executed from untrusted sources",
  "flows": "runtime() is called asynchronously during module import, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "The code attempts to initialize runtime asynchronously depending on the event loop status, which is standard; no suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The script imports core components and utility functions, then defines an asynchronous initialization function _background_init() that awaits runtime(). It checks if an asyncio event loop is running; if not, it runs the initialization with asyncio.run(); otherwise, it schedules the coroutine thread-safe. The approach ensures asynchronous setup at import time. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code is straightforward, focusing on setup, with proper handling of event loop states.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs asynchronous initialization of a runtime component upon import without any malicious intent. It properly handles event loop states and does not contain suspicious or malicious code elements. Overall, it appears safe.",
