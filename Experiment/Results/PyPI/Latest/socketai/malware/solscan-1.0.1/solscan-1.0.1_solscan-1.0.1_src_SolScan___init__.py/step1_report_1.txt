  "purpose": "Initialize runtime environment asynchronously when the module is imported.",
  "sources": "import statements from .core, .utils, and ._config modules; invocation of runtime() via asyncio.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> check asyncio event loop -> run runtime() asynchronously.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation. Use of asyncio to run background initialization is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core components and utility functions, including an async runtime configuration. It then defines an asynchronous initialization function '_background_init' that calls 'runtime()'. It checks whether an asyncio event loop is running; if not, it runs the initialization with asyncio.run. If an event loop is active, it schedules the initialization to run thread-safely via 'asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe'. These are typical patterns for asynchronous setup in Python modules. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious external communication. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard asynchronous runtime initialization during module import. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior and appears to be a normal setup routine for a package. No security risks or anomalies are detected.",
