{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a ZIP archive from a hardcoded URL, extracts its contents, locates 'config2.exe', and executes it silently without validation or integrity checks.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to the hardcoded URL with SSL verification disabled; reading response content in chunks.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'config2.exe' via subprocess.Popen without validation; silent process execution suppressing output.",
  "flows": "Download response content -> save as ZIP -> extract ZIP -> locate 'config2.exe' -> execute 'config2.exe' silently.",
  "anomalies": "Disabling SSL verification (`ssl=False`), no validation or signature checks on downloaded executable, silent execution hiding activity, no integrity verification, no error handling for malicious content.",
  "analysis": "The code performs an untrusted download over an insecure connection, extracts potentially malicious content, and executes it without validation or verification, which is a common pattern in supply chain attacks. The SSL verification is disabled, increasing MITM risk. Silent execution further conceals malicious activity. No validation or signature checks are present, making this pattern highly dangerous. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The behavior indicates high malicious potential, especially if the executable is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk behavior characteristic of malicious or compromised supply chain activity. It downloads and executes an external binary without validation, with SSL verification disabled and silent execution, creating a significant security vulnerability. The malware score should be set to 0.9, and the overall security risk to 0.9, reflecting the high potential for malicious activity.",
