  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk behavior characteristic of malicious or compromised supply chain activity. It downloads and executes an external binary without validation, with SSL verification disabled and silent execution, creating a significant security vulnerability. The malware score should be set to 0.9, and the overall security risk to 0.9, reflecting the high potential for malicious activity."
