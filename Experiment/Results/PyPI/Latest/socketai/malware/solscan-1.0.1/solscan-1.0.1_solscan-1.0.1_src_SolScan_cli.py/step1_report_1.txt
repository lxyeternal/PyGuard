{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface (CLI) to retrieve transaction and token information from the SolScan API for the Solana blockchain.",
  "sources": "Loads environment variables via dotenv; receives command-line arguments for transaction hashes and token addresses.",
  "sinks": "Uses the SolScanAPI to fetch data based on user input; outputs information via click.echo.",
  "flows": "User input (transaction hash or mint address) flows into async API calls; results are printed to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscation. No unusual code structures, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, calling external API methods based on user input. It relies on environment variables loaded via dotenv, which could contain secrets, but no secrets are hardcoded. No malicious code or malicious data flow is detected. The code does not perform any unsafe operations, data leaks, or system modifications. It primarily fetches and displays blockchain data. No suspicious behaviors or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper for the SolScan API, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It performs expected data retrieval functions without engaging in malicious activities.",
