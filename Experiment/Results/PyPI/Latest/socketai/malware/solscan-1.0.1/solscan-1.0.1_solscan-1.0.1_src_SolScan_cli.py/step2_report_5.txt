  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code and applying critical reasoning.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a straightforward CLI wrapper around the SolScanAPI.\n- Loads environment variables via dotenv (possibly for API keys).\n- Provides commands to fetch transaction details and token info.\n- Uses asyncio for asynchronous API calls.\n- Outputs data via click.echo.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** The code matches the described functionality. No errors, flaws, or security issues are visible.\n- **Malware presence:** The code is purely for data retrieval; no malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code is detected.\n- **Security risk:** The minimal risk relates to environment variable handling, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** CLI for SolScan API data retrieval.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, appropriate)\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no secrets hardcoded, standard API calls.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (still low, acceptable)\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, standard use of environment variables.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (appropriate)\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no secrets hardcoded, standard API usage.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard CLI pattern.\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to zero, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- The confidence levels are high, consistent with the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard CLI for API data retrieval)\n\nThe code is a standard, safe CLI utility for blockchain data access, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
