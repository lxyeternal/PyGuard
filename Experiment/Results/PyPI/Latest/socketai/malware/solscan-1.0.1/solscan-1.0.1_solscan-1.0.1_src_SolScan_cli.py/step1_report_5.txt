{
  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the SolScan API to retrieve transaction and token information from the Solana blockchain.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments ('tx_hash' and 'mint_address') as input data for the API calls.",
  "sinks": "The outputs are printed to the console using click.echo. No untrusted data is directly written to external files, network, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "User inputs (tx_hash, mint_address) flow into API method calls; API responses are then printed to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of dotenv.load_dotenv() loads environment variables securely; no sensitive data appears hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a custom API module, uses environment variable loading appropriately, and employs asyncio for asynchronous API calls. The command-line arguments are used to fetch data from the SolScanAPI. The output is printed to the terminal, and no data is sent over the network outside the API calls. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The structure and logic are straightforward, and the code does not perform any suspicious or potentially malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign CLI tool for fetching and displaying blockchain transaction and token data. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
