  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Verification:**\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for the SolScanAPI, fetching transaction and token info based on user input.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code are present.\n   - Uses dotenv to load environment variables, which is standard practice.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or backdoors are evident.\n   - The code interacts only with external APIs and outputs data to the console.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, benign CLI utility.\n   - No logical flaws or suspicious reasoning are present.\n   - The analysis consistently states that the code performs expected functions without malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: Very low (0.1–0.2)\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis.\n   - The malware scores of 0 are justified; no malicious activity is detected.\n   - The obfuscated scores of 0 are justified; no obfuscation is present.\n   - The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code loads environment variables via dotenv, there is a minor risk if environment variables contain secrets, but this is standard and not inherently malicious.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code only fetches and displays data.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a benign CLI tool with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — Very low, primarily due to reliance on environment variables loaded from potentially untrusted sources, but this is standard practice and not a security flaw.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a legitimate, standard CLI utility for blockchain data retrieval. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Keep the security risk score at around 0.1 to reflect minimal, standard configuration practices.\n- No further action needed.",
