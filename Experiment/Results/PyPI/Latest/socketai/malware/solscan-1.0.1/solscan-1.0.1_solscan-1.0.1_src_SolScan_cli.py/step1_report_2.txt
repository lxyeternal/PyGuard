{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with SolScan API to retrieve transaction and token information on the Solana blockchain.",
  "sources": "Imports dotenv to load environment variables, potentially from untrusted environment variables; calls async API methods to fetch data based on user input.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via click.echo(), which is safe for display; no data sinks that send data elsewhere or leak data outside the process are evident.",
  "flows": "User provides transaction hash or mint address -> API fetches corresponding data -> data displayed in CLI output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. Usage of asyncio and external API calls appears standard. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a CLI with commands to query blockchain data via SolScanAPI. It loads environment variables with dotenv, possibly from untrusted sources, but this is typical for configuration. The API calls are asynchronous and only display the fetched data without any side effects or data exfiltration. There are no obfuscated parts, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors. The code functions solely as a data retrieval tool for blockchain info.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI utility for blockchain data retrieval with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It relies on external API calls and environment variables for configuration, which is standard practice. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
