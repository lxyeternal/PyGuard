{
  "purpose": "Provide a CLI tool to fetch and display Solana blockchain transaction and token information using the SolScanAPI.",
  "sources": "Environment variables loaded via dotenv, user input via command-line arguments (tx_hash, mint_address).",
  "sinks": "Outputs to the console via click.echo; API calls to SolScanAPI.",
  "flows": "User inputs (tx_hash, mint_address) are used in API calls within asynchronous functions, whose results are then printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or credentials visible; no obfuscated code or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a custom API class, loads environment variables, and defines CLI commands for fetching transaction and token info. Asynchronous API calls are made within command functions, with outputs displayed via click.echo. No unsafe data handling, code injection, or malicious network activity is evident. The code structure is typical for a CLI interface, with no anomalies indicating sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper around the SolScanAPI for retrieving blockchain data. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It relies on external environment variables and user input, but no malicious intent or security threats are detected.",
