  "purpose": "Provide a CLI tool to query transaction and token details from SolScan API",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments ('tx_hash', 'mint_address')",
  "sinks": "API calls to SolScanAPI methods; output via click.echo",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> API methods -> Display output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious dynamic code execution; dotenv used only for environment variables; standard API interaction pattern",
  "analysis": "The code defines a command-line interface using 'click' for querying transaction and token data from SolScanAPI. It loads environment variables via dotenv, likely for API keys (not shown explicitly). It uses asynchronous API calls within asyncio.run, which is safe. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors. The code appears straightforward and intended for legitimate API data retrieval. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present. The overall design is standard for CLI tools accessing APIs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper around SolScan API, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended to query blockchain data without any suspicious or malicious logic.",
