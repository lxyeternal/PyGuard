      "conclusion": "The code is a standard async initialization routine with no inherent malicious or obfuscated content. The main risk stems from the 'runtime()' function in '_config', which could be malicious if untrusted. To mitigate this, verify the implementation of 'runtime()'. Given the current information, the code is safe, but the potential for supply chain attack via 'runtime()' warrants a risk score of 0.5."

It downloads and executes an external binary without validation, with SSL verification disabled and silent execution, creating a significant security vulnerability. The malware score should be set to 0.9, and the overall security risk to 0.9, reflecting the high potential for malicious activity."
