{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'solscan', intended for blockchain analytics and tracking on the Solana network.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; no other input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external data outputs are evident in this code.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> passes data to setup() for package configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious constructs observed. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools modules, reads a README file with specified encoding, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers. It appears to be a typical Python package setup configuration. No code injection, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are detected. The dependencies are common and do not exhibit signs of malicious intent. The code structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated elements, or suspicious external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for a Python package and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manages package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious or harmful logic.",
