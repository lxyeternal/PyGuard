  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the details:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup.py script for a Python package named 'solscan'.\n- The code reads a README.md file with UTF-8 encoding, specifies package metadata, dependencies, entry points, classifiers, and Python version requirements.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or user input handling is observed.\n- The dependencies are common Python packages.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python packaging.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate; describes the setup for 'solscan'.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct; no untrusted data or external outputs.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; standard setup script.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Same as above, consistent and accurate.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Same findings; all standard practices.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Again, standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Consistent with others; no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** No.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or suspicious code, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### **Final Justification**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a standard setup script.\n- No suspicious patterns, external data handling, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The dependency list and code structure are typical for such scripts.\n- The reading of README.md with specified encoding is a best practice, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate**\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
