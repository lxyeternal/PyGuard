{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'solscan', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; importing setuptools modules; defining install_requires; setting up entry_points and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly sinks untrusted data or performs operations with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A - The script only specifies package metadata and dependencies without processing or executing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles static configuration for package distribution. It reads a README file with specified encoding and sets package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or user input handling occurs. The dependencies listed are common libraries used in Python projects. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It appears legitimate and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
