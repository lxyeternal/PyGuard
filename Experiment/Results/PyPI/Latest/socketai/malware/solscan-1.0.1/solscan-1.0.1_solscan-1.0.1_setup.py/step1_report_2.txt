  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'solscan' Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; importing setuptools functions; specifying package dependencies; defining console script entry point.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this script; no untrusted data is written or executed.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md content flows into the 'long_description' variable; package setup configuration flows into the packaging process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. No external data sources or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary setup functions, reads a README file with specified encoding, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are observed. The code is straightforward and adheres typical packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious or suspicious elements. No security risks identified. The package appears safe based on this code.",
