  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'solscan', defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file with UTF-8 encoding; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Reads static README file; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script utilizing setuptools to configure package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points. It performs static file reading and package configuration without dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code structure and dependencies are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe and legitimate configuration.",
