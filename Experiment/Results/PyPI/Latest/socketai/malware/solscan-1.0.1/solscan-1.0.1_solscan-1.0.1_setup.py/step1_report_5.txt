{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'solscan', including package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; static package configuration data such as name, version, author info, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sources or network communication in the provided code.",
  "flows": "The static configuration data flows from the setup parameters to the packaging process; no runtime data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns detected. All code is standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to prepare package installation, reading a README file for description and defining dependencies, entry points, and metadata. No dynamic code execution, no untrusted input handling, no network activity, and no embedded secrets or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and typical for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file without any suspicious or harmful elements.",
