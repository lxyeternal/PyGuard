  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code is static, reads a README file, and sets package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.\n- No external data processing, dynamic code execution, or network interactions are present.\n- The dependencies are common and do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**Code content review:**\n- The code reads `README.md` with UTF-8 encoding — standard practice.\n- Uses `setuptools` to define package configuration.\n- No untrusted data inputs, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- The package name is `\"solscan\"` (not `\"soltracker\"` as in the URL), but this discrepancy does not impact security analysis.\n- No hardcoded credentials, no external data fetching, no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Assessment of the reports:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are 1 across all reports, which is justified given the straightforward, static nature of the script.\n- Malware scores are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, the code matches the description and contains no issues.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Scores justification:**  \n  The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all appropriately set to 0.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on code inspection.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  The only minor note is the URL referencing `\"https://github.com/blockchain-analytics/soltracker\"` while the package is `\"solscan\"`. This could be a documentation inconsistency but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, static `setup.py` script with no dynamic or malicious elements. The dependencies are common, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Confirmed as safe.  \n- No security risks or malware present.  \n- The scores are appropriate.  \n- The only note is a potential documentation inconsistency regarding the URL, but this does not impact security.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.**",
