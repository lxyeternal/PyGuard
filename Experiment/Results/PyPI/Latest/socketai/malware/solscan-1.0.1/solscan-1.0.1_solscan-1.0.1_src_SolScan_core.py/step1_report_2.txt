{
  "purpose": "Provides an asynchronous Python SDK for interacting with the SolScan API to retrieve transaction and token information.",
  "sources": "Reads API key from environment variable 'SOLSCAN_API_KEY' during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Makes HTTP GET requests to API endpoints using aiohttp; uses untrusted data (API responses) processed via parse_response.",
  "flows": "Input API key -> request headers; input transaction hash/mint address -> API request URLs -> HTTP responses -> parsed data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated code; no suspicious API URLs; proper use of environment variables; no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes and an API client that makes asynchronous requests to a public API. It properly handles API key retrieval from environment variables, uses request rate limiting, and performs standard HTTP request operations with error handling. The request headers include a User-Agent and Accept header, with optional Authorization header if API key exists. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. The code relies on external functions 'rate_limited' and 'parse_response' but their usage appears standard. Overall, the implementation seems to serve legitimate purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK implementation for API interaction with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It securely manages API keys via environment variables, and there are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
