  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided details.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard async Python SDK for interacting with an external API (SolScan).\n- API key handling is via environment variable or constructor argument, which is standard.\n- HTTP requests are made with aiohttp, with rate limiting decorators, which are appropriate.\n- The code constructs URLs based on input parameters and makes GET requests.\n- Responses are processed via an external 'parse_response' function (not provided), which could be a concern if it mishandles data, but there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious URL patterns are reported.\n- The overall confidence in the reports is high (0.9), and malware scores are zero.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  The code appears clean, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The only potential concern is the reliance on external 'parse_response' and 'rate_limited' functions, but these are not inherently malicious.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- No evident flaws in logic or reasoning. The code follows standard patterns for an API SDK.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk:** Scores are low (0.1-0.2), which seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- The only possible concern is if 'parse_response' mishandles data, but this is not shown. Since it's an external utility, and the code doesn't execute untrusted data directly, this is not a malware concern.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent with the reports and code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's purpose and implementation, a risk score of around 0.1-0.2 is appropriate, reflecting minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward SDK for API interaction, following best practices. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The only minor concern is external functions whose implementation isn't shown, but nothing indicates malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, well-structured, and secure for its intended purpose. No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided information.",
