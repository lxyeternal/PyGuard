  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a standard, asynchronous Python SDK for interacting with the SolScan API.\n- It retrieves API keys from environment variables or constructor arguments.\n- Uses aiohttp for HTTP requests, with rate limiting decorators.\n- Constructs URLs dynamically based on input parameters.\n- Uses external functions `parse_response` and `rate_limited`, which are assumed to be standard utilities.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious URL endpoints are noted.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection.\n- The responses and flow are consistent with typical API client patterns.\n\n**Specific points from each report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0\n   - **Security risk:** 0.2\n   - **Confidence:** 0.9\n   - **Assessment:** No malicious behavior or malware detected. Slightly elevated security risk score may reflect general concerns about untrusted API responses, but nothing malicious is evident.\n\n2. **Report 2:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0\n   - **Security risk:** 0.1\n   - **Confidence:** 0.9\n   - **Assessment:** Similar to report 1, no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score aligns with standard API client behavior.\n\n3. **Report 3:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0\n   - **Security risk:** 0.2\n   - **Confidence:** 0.9\n   - **Assessment:** No suspicious code or behavior. The use of environment variables and standard HTTP requests is typical.\n\n4. **Report 4:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0\n   - **Security risk:** 0.1\n   - **Confidence:** 0.9\n   - **Assessment:** Same conclusions—no malicious intent, straightforward implementation.\n\n5. **Report 5:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0\n   - **Security risk:** 0\n   - **Confidence:** 0.9\n   - **Assessment:** Clear and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malware or malicious intent:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code in the provided code snippets.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Use of environment variables:** Proper and standard.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only concern could be untrusted API responses, but this is typical for SDKs and not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores consistency:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2) seems reasonable, reflecting minimal security concerns beyond standard API interactions.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** — aligns with standard API client risks, such as reliance on external data.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nConsidering all the above, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — reflecting typical API interaction risks but no specific vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK for interacting with the SolScan API, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores provided in the reports are consistent with this conclusion.",
