  "purpose": "A Python SDK for interacting with the SolScan API to retrieve transaction and token information.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SOLSCAN_API_KEY' for API key, URL construction for API requests, user input for transaction hash and mint address.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests to API endpoints, passing API key in Authorization header, response JSON processing.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (tx_hash, mint_address, api_key) -> URL construction -> HTTP request -> JSON response -> parse_response",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable for API key, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious URL endpoints.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an API client with optional API key sourced from environment variables. It constructs request URLs dynamically based on input parameters and performs HTTP GET requests with appropriate headers. The session management uses aiohttp and includes rate limiting decorators. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. All inputs and outputs are to external API endpoints with standard security practices. The code relies on external modules for rate limiting and response parsing, which appear benign. No suspicious or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client implementation with secure handling of API keys via environment variables and proper HTTP request management. No malicious or sabotage behavior is evident. Overall, it is a safe and legitimate implementation.",
