{
  "purpose": "A Python SDK for interacting with the SolScan API, providing methods to retrieve transaction details and token information asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Reads API key from environment variable 'SOLSCAN_API_KEY' during initialization; reads data from HTTP GET requests to the API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data from API responses processed by 'parse_response' and returned as dataclass instances; potential injection if 'parse_response' mishandles data (though not shown).",
  "flows": "Environment variable or constructor argument -> API request URL construction -> HTTP GET request -> response data -> parse_response -> return data objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of environment variable for API key is standard; no obfuscated code or unusual patterns; standard use of aiohttp; no suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an asynchronous API client with optional API key from environment; constructs URLs for API endpoints; uses rate-limited request methods; processes JSON responses via a 'parse_response' function (not provided). The code does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The use of environment variables for API keys is common and secure if managed properly. No unsafe data handling or dangerous code patterns are visible. Dependencies are standard, and the code structure is typical for an API SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard SDK for API interactions with no malicious intent. It reads configuration securely, uses asynchronous requests properly, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
