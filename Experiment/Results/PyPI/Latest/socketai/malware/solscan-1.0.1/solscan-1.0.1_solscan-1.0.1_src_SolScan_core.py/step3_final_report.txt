  "purpose": "A Python SDK for interacting with the SolScan API to retrieve transaction and token information.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for API key, input parameters for transaction hash and mint address, external functions 'parse_response' and 'rate_limited'.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests to API endpoints, response data processed via external parser.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> URL construction -> HTTP request -> response handling -> data parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; external functions used are standard and presumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, asynchronous Python SDK that manages API keys securely via environment variables, constructs URLs based on input, and makes HTTP GET requests with proper headers and rate limiting. It uses external utility functions for response parsing and rate limiting, which are typical in such SDKs. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The response handling and request flow are straightforward, with no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), consistent across all reports. The confidence level is high (0.9), given the code's clarity and standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and well-structured SDK for SolScan API interaction. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
