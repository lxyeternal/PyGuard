  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core points:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Code**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward SDK for API interaction.\n   - No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are identified.\n   - The code uses environment variables for API keys, which is standard practice.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - The code structure appears sound.\n   - The only potential concern is the reliance on external functions `parse_response` and `rate_limited`. However, their usage seems standard, and no malicious behavior is suggested.\n   - No evident vulnerabilities or logic flaws.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Issues**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: Very low (0.1–0.2)\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification**:\n   - Since no malicious or suspicious activity is detected, the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The overall security risk is minimal; the code is a typical API client.\n   - The scores are consistent with the reports' conclusions.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions or Misinterpretations**:\n   - The reports assume that `parse_response` and `rate_limited` are benign, which seems reasonable.\n   - No signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or other malicious activities.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard, well-structured SDK for API access.\n   - No evidence supports any malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware score**: Keep at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score**: Keep at **0**.\n- **Risk score**: Keep at **0.1–0.2**, reflecting minimal security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0.1 (since the code is straightforward and uses standard practices)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a legitimate, secure SDK for interacting with the SolScan API. No malicious or suspicious elements are present. The scores given are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
