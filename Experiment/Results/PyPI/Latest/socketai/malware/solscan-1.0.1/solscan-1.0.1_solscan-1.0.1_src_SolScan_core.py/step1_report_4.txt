{
  "purpose": "The code implements an asynchronous Python client for the SolScan API, providing methods to fetch transaction details and token information from the Solana blockchain.",
  "sources": "The code reads the API key from an environment variable 'SOLSCAN_API_KEY' and constructs URLs using input parameters (tx_hash, mint_address).",
  "sinks": "The untrusted data flows from the JSON response obtained via the API request. The API key, if provided, is used in the Authorization header.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (tx_hash, mint_address) are used to build URLs, which are then requested via _make_request; the responses are parsed into data classes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials are present; the API key is retrieved from environment variables. Usage of environment variables is standard and not suspicious. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client using aiohttp. It fetches data from external endpoints with input parameters. The API key management is standard, using environment variables and optional parameter. No suspicious data handling or obfuscated code is present. The functions are well-structured with rate limiting and error handling via response.raise_for_status(). The responses are parsed using imported utility functions, which are assumed to be standard. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client for SolScan, with no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security issues. It follows best practices for API interaction and environment variable usage. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
