  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard, asynchronous API client for SolScan.\n- The code retrieves API keys from environment variables, constructs URLs based on input parameters, and makes HTTP GET requests.\n- External functions `rate_limited` and `parse_response` are used but not shown; their usage appears standard.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified across all reports.\n- The code structure is typical for an SDK interacting with a REST API.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code?**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious code is detected or suspected. This aligns with the code review, which finds no malicious patterns.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  All reports agree on obfuscated score 0, which is consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n- **Security Risks & Data Handling:**  \n  Slight variations in the security risk scores (ranging from 0 to 0.2) are reasonable given the minimal risk associated with API key handling and standard HTTP requests.\n\n- **Flow & Data Handling:**  \n  The data flows from environment variables or constructor args to URL construction, then to HTTP requests, then to response parsing. No suspicious data flows or injection points are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code does not contain any malicious or obfuscated code.  \n- They note that `parse_response` and `rate_limited` are external, but their usage appears benign.  \n- No report claims or implies any malicious intent or supply chain sabotage.\n\n### Scores & Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No change needed.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The risk scores are low (0 to 0.2), reflecting minimal security concern, which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  The only potential concern could be the `parse_response` function—if it mishandles data, it could introduce vulnerabilities, but since it's external and not shown, and the reports do not flag this, it’s reasonable to accept their neutral stance.\n\n- **Any signs of supply chain attack?**  \n  No. The code is a typical SDK with no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary & Recommendations:\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' assessments.**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard SDK implementation for interacting with the SolScan API, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external dependencies and API key management, which are handled appropriately.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Aspect             | My assessment        |\n|--------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0                      |\n| Risk               | 0.1 (aligned with reports) |\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe code appears safe and free from malicious or supply chain threats. No further action is necessary beyond standard security best practices for API key management.\n\n---\n\n**Work through completed.**",
