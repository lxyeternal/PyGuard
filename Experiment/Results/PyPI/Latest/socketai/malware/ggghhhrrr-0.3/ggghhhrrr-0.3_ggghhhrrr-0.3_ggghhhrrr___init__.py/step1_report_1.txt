  "purpose": "Send a notification message to an external URL when the notify() function is called.",
  "sources": "The URL variable and the data dictionary within the notify() function.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post() method which transmits data over the network to an external server.",
  "flows": "The function prepares data, then uses requests.post() to send data to the specified URL; the response is checked and printed.",
  "anomalies": "The code contacts an external server with a suspicious domain (oastify.com), which may be used for tracking or data exfiltration; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that sends a POST request with a message to a specified URL. The URL points to a known oast (trap) domain used for monitoring outbound requests, often in security testing or potentially malicious tracking. There are no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The logic is straightforward. The external request could be used maliciously if integrated into larger malware or tracking mechanisms. The code itself does not perform malicious actions, but it contacts a suspicious domain, indicating potential tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply sends a notification message to a suspicious external domain. While the code is simple, the external contact point raises concerns about potential tracking or covert data transmission. No malicious behavior is explicitly coded, but the external contact is suspicious.",
