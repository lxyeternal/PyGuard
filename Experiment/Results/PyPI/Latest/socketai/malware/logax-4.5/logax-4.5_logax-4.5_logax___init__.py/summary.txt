  "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign; no malicious behavior is evident. The primary security concern is the content of 'info', which cannot be assessed here. The scores assigned are appropriate, with low malware and obfuscation scores, and a modest risk score due to the use of 'import *'. The overall security posture is cautious but justified based on the available information."
