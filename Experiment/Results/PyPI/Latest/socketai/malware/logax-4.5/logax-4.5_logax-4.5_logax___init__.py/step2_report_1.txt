  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code is a simple relative import statement importing all symbols from a local module `info`.\n- There is no direct execution, data processing, or external data handling visible.\n- Use of `import *` can be considered bad practice due to obscurity, but it is not inherently malicious.\n- The actual security implications depend heavily on the contents of the `info` module, which are unknown here.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Import from `info`, benign, no malicious behavior visible.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.4, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no evidence of malicious activity. The low confidence reflects uncertainty about the `info` content.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Import all from `info`, potential obscurity but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.5, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the main concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious imports if `info` is malicious, but this cannot be confirmed here.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, highlights the risk of `import *`.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.6, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher confidence, which is acceptable given the potential risks of obscured imports. No malware detected.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate; no change necessary.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Import is benign; no apparent malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.5, malware 0, risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no evidence of malicious activity. The absence of risk is justified.\n- **Verdict:** Valid; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Import could trigger code execution if `info` contains executable code.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.5, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The mention of potential code execution is valid, especially if `info` executes code upon import. However, since we cannot see `info`, the risk is speculative.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is cautious and appropriate; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which aligns with the fact that the code snippet itself is harmless; the risk depends on the contents of `info`.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, which is correct; no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting the uncertainty about `info`'s trustworthiness.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The only potential concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious imports if `info` is malicious, but this cannot be determined here.\n- Since the content of `info` is unknown, a conservative approach would keep the malware score at 0 unless there's evidence of malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- The code snippet is benign in isolation.\n- The main security concern is the trustworthiness of the `info` module, which cannot be assessed here.\n- The current scores are reasonable given the information.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code in the snippet)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious or unwanted code if `info` is malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and cautious. The main risk lies in the trustworthiness of the `info` module rather than the import statement itself. No changes to scores are necessary based on the available information.",
