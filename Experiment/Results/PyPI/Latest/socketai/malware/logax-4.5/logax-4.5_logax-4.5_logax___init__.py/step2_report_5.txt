  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code performs a relative import, bringing all symbols from the 'info' module into the current namespace.\n- This pattern is common in Python packages but can be risky if the imported module contains malicious code or secrets.\n- The import statement itself is not malicious; however, the content of 'info' could be.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from 'info'.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the import alone is benign but notes the risk if 'info' contains malicious code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.4 (moderate confidence, as no content is shown).\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code).\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, since only import).\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues found. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Import all symbols from 'info'.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, highlights the risk of 'import *' hiding malicious symbols.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No malicious activity evident; the concern is about obscurity, which is valid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from 'info'.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to previous, emphasizes the risk of hiding malicious code via 'import *'.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No malicious behavior detected; the concern about 'import *' is justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from 'info'.\n- **Analysis:** Notes that the import does not itself perform malicious actions but warns about the potential for malicious code in 'info'.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No malicious activity is observed; the risk depends on 'info's content.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from 'info'.\n- **Analysis:** Similar, with emphasis on the possibility of code execution if 'info' contains executable code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. The import itself isn't malicious, but the content of 'info' could be.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the import statement is benign by itself.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware or malicious payloads in the import statement.\n- **Use of 'import *':** The main concern is obscurity, which is consistently acknowledged.\n- **Content of 'info':** Cannot be assessed here; risk depends on the actual module content.\n\n### **Scores and Recommendations:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the information.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.2), justified by the potential risk if 'info' contains malicious code.\n- Confidence levels are reasonable, considering the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n- The import statement itself is not malicious.\n- The main security concern is the content of the 'info' module, which cannot be evaluated here.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code in the import statement itself).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected).\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (potential risk if 'info' contains malicious code, but not confirmed).\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and cautious, correctly focusing on the import's potential risks without overestimating. The code snippet is benign by itself; the security implications depend entirely on the 'info' module's contents.",
