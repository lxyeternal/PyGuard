  "purpose": "Import all symbols and functions from the 'info' module in the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing everything from a local module (.info).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this line; no data processing or untrusted data handling occurs here.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; this line only imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure what symbols are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unwanted code, but by itself, this is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a simple import from a local module, which is standard in Python packages. Since no other code or data handling is present, there are no active security issues or malicious behaviors detected. The 'import *' syntax can be risky if the imported module contains malicious code, but on its own, it is not malicious. Without additional context or the contents of the 'info' module, no malicious activity can be confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evident malicious behavior. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious imports if the 'info' module contains harmful code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
