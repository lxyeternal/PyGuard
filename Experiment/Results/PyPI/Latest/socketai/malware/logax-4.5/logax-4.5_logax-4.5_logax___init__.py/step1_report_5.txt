{
  "purpose": "Import all contents from the module named 'info' within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement indicates reading from a local module file 'info'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the import might load code that executes upon import.",
  "flows": "Imported module's code executes at import time, potentially leading to code execution if 'info' contains executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'from .info import *' can hide what is being imported, making it harder to audit. No other anomalies visible from this single line.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a relative import statement, which imports all symbols from the 'info' module within the same package. There is no indication of malicious behavior in this single line, but if the 'info' module contains malicious code or triggers execution upon import, it could pose risks. Since no code from 'info' is shown, the risk assessment is limited to the import statement itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard relative import, which is common in Python packages. Without inspecting the 'info' module, there is no evidence of malicious behavior from this line alone. However, the use of 'import *' can hide imported symbols and should be reviewed in the context of the 'info' module's content.",
