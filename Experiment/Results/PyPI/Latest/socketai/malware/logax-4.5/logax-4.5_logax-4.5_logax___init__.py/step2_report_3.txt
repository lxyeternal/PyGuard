  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- The code only performs a relative import of all symbols from a local module named `info`.\n- No code execution, data flow, or suspicious behavior is visible in this line alone.\n- The use of `import *` is generally discouraged because it obscures imported symbols, but it is not inherently malicious.\n- The security implications depend heavily on the content of the `info` module, which is not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the import operation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes `import *` is bad practice but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that the code is benign in isolation.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.4, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The low malware and risk scores are justified given the limited context.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights `import *` obscures symbols.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that the import itself isn't malicious but warns about potential hidden malicious code in `info`.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.5, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The use of `import *` warrants caution, but without evidence of malicious content, scores remain low.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes potential for imported code to execute if malicious.\n- **Anomalies:** Again, the use of `import *` can hide malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately cautious, emphasizing that the risk depends on `info`.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.6, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher confidence is justified due to the potential for hidden malicious code, but without evidence, the malware score remains zero.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No active code or data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies other than the import style.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the snippet is benign, with no malware or security issues apparent.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.5, malware 0, risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes that code in `info` could execute upon import.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `import *` can hide symbols.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly states that the risk depends on `info`, and no malicious behavior is evident from the import alone.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.5, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate, but the mention that import could lead to code execution if `info` contains executable code is valid.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points and recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the information. However, if `info` contains malicious code, the malware score should be increased. Since we cannot verify `info`, the current score remains justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All zero, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated (0.2) in most reports, reflecting the potential risk if `info` contains malicious code or secrets. This is reasonable, considering the use of `import *` can obscure malicious imports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Code behavior:** Benign in isolation; no malicious activity can be inferred.\n- **Scores:** The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- **Potential for higher risk:** If further context shows `info` contains malicious code or secrets, the malware and risk scores should be increased accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (unless evidence suggests malicious code in `info`)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (the code is straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to the use of `import *` and potential hidden content)\n\n**Summary:** The current assessments are appropriate. No changes needed unless additional context about `info` is provided.",
