{
  "purpose": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from the 'info' module, likely to access its contents within the current namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statement itself; the 'info' module being imported",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported symbols, which could be malicious if 'info' contains harmful code",
  "flows": "Imported symbols are brought into the namespace; any subsequent use of these symbols could lead to data leaks or malicious actions if 'info' is compromised",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which obscures imported symbols; no direct anomalies in this snippet, but the practice can hide malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement that does not execute code directly or handle untrusted data. The security risk depends on the contents of 'info', which are unknown. The use of 'import *' can hide malicious symbols or code within 'info', but the import itself is benign. The malware score remains at 0, and obfuscation is not present. The risk score is low (0.2), reflecting the potential danger if 'info' contains malicious code. Confidence in this assessment is moderate, given the limited context. Overall, the code is harmless in isolation, with the main concern being the trustworthiness of 'info'.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign; no malicious behavior is evident. The primary security concern is the content of 'info', which cannot be assessed here. The scores assigned are appropriate, with low malware and obfuscation scores, and a modest risk score due to the use of 'import *'. The overall security posture is cautious but justified based on the available information.",
