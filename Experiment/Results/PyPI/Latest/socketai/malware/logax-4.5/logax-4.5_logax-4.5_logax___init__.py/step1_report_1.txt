{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'info'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which reads the contents of the 'info' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this single import statement; it merely loads code from another module.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a wildcard import (*) can be considered bad practice, but it is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior is visible.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs an import operation from a relative module named 'info'. It does not execute any code directly or include any suspicious patterns. Without seeing the content of 'info', no malicious behavior can be inferred. The import could be benign or potentially risky if 'info' contains malicious code, but that cannot be determined from this snippet alone. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious control flows are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet by itself is benign. It only imports a module and does not perform any malicious actions. No indicators of malicious intent or security risks are observable in this isolated line.",
