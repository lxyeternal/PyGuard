{
  "purpose": "Imports all contents from the 'info' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "The 'from .info import *' statement, which reads the 'info' module and its exports.",
  "sinks": "Potentially any part of the imported 'info' module if it contains untrusted data or code execution.",
  "flows": "The current module loads everything from 'info', then may use it elsewhere; no direct flow visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') which can obscure imported content and potentially hide malicious code or unintended behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a relative import statement importing all symbols from the 'info' module. While the import itself is not malicious, the use of 'import *' can be suspicious as it hides what is imported, possibly concealing malicious or unwanted functions or data. Since no other code or logic is present, no malicious activity or security risks are directly evident in this snippet. However, the context of the 'info' module content is unknown, which could contain malicious or sensitive data. The code’s minimalism and import style warrant caution, especially if the 'info' module's origin or contents are untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple relative import with no immediate malicious behavior. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to obscurity and potential for importing malicious or unwanted code from 'info'. There is no clear evidence of malicious intent in this snippet alone, but the overall security depends on the 'info' module's trustworthiness.",
