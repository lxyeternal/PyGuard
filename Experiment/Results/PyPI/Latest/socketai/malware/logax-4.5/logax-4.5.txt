      "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign; no malicious behavior is evident. The primary security concern is the content of 'info', which cannot be assessed here. The scores assigned are appropriate, with low malware and obfuscation scores, and a modest risk score due to the use of 'import *'. The overall security posture is cautious but justified based on the available information."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious, potentially malicious behavior through obfuscated remote URL handling, silent download and execution of external code, and stealth mechanisms. The pattern is characteristic of malware or backdoors. The scores in the reports are appropriate; I recommend treating this as malicious with high severity. The overall security risk is very high due to remote code execution capabilities, obfuscation, and stealth features."
