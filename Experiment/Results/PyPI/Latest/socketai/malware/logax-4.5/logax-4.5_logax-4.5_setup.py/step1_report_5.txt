{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package called 'logax'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; reading package dependencies from 'install_requires'.",
  "targets": "No explicit data sinks; configuration data is used for package installation.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; setup parameters are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code; no unusual code structures or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and reads a README file for long description. It then configures package metadata including name, version, author info, description, URL, project URLs, packages, classifiers, license, Python version requirement, and dependencies. All information appears standard for a Python package setup script. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected. Dependencies include 'requests', 'pybase64', and 'importlib', which are common and benign. The author and author_email fields are empty, which is unusual but not malicious. The code performs file reading and package configuration without executing external code or performing unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears legitimate and safe.",
