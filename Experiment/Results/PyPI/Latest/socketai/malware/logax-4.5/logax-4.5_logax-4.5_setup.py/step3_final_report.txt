  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; uses find_packages() to identify packages; static metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields are unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static configuration, no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated patterns. Dependencies are common, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The empty author fields are unconventional but not malicious. All signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
