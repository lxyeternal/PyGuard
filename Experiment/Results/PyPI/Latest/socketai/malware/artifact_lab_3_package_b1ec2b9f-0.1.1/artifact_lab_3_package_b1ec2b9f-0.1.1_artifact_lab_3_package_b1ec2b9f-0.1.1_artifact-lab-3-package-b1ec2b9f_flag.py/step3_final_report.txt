  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates all environment variables by encoding them in base64 and sending to a suspicious external URL.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.environ, converting to string, encoding in ASCII bytes.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via requests.post to an external URL without validation or authentication.",
  "flows": "os.environ -> str -> encode('ascii') -> base64.b64encode -> requests.post to external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Exfiltration of environment variables to an untrusted URL, no validation, no user consent, straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves all environment variables, encodes them in base64, and transmits them to a suspicious URL, indicating data exfiltration. The code is simple, not obfuscated, and lacks validation or authentication. The URL is suspicious, and the activity suggests malicious intent. The behavior aligns with malicious data theft, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The code's straightforward nature confirms low obfuscation. The activity's severity justifies a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9, with high confidence (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code performs clear and straightforward environment data exfiltration to a suspicious URL, indicating malicious behavior with high security risk. The activity is consistent with malware intent, and the scores should reflect high severity.",
