{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some data processing or utility functions, with no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown; no input functions like input(), reading files, or network requests are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "There are no observable data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks within the code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are detected; the code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is analyzed step-by-step and shows no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. It uses standard libraries and constructs without suspicious patterns. No hidden code, backdoors, or unauthorized data transmissions are present. The absence of input/output operations or external calls reduces the likelihood of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign and standard in nature, with no indicators of supply chain attack vectors or malware.",
