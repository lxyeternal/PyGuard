{
  "purpose": "The code is a benign Python script with no clear malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; code does not read external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from sources to sinks; code appears self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign nature. The security risk scores are low (0 to 0.2), reflecting minimal or no threat. Minor adjustments could be made to set the risk scores to 0 for more accuracy, especially in the most benign cases.",
  "conclusion": "All code snippets are benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate; however, setting the security risk scores to 0 in the most benign cases would better reflect their safety. Overall, the supply chain security posture is sound.",
