{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a simple utility for processing or handling data, possibly related to package setup or utility functions. It does not clearly indicate malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, file system (e.g., reading files), and possibly user inputs via command line or other interfaces.",
  "sinks": "Writes to files, possibly makes network requests or executes subprocesses, or modifies system state.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or user inputs to file operations or network calls; however, no explicit or suspicious flow is identified without further context.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual behavior such as dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration routines observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with standard Python functions. It reads data from expected sources and performs typical operations like file handling or environment variable access. No malicious patterns or security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or code injection are evident. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious by itself. Absence of obfuscated code or suspicious network activity suggests low malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to serve legitimate purposes with no evident supply chain threats or malware. The confidence score is high due to the lack of suspicious elements.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
