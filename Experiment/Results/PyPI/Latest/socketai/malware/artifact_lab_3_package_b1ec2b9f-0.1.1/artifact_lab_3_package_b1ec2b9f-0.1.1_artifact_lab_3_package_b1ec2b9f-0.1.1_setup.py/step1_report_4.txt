  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; this is a static configuration script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard use of setuptools for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools modules to configure package installation, specifying name, version, packages, and dependencies. It uses find_packages() to automatically include sub-packages and lists 'requests' as a dependency with a specific minimum version. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behaviors are present. It appears to be a typical setup script for packaging a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
