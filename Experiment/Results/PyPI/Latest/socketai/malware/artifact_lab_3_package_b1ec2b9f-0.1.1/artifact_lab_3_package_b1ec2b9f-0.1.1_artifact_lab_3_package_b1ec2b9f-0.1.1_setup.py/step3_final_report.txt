{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging and distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No dynamic inputs, environment variables, or external data; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A; code is static and declarative, with no data flow or execution paths involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, well-structured setup script with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It contains no dynamic code, no obfuscated or malicious patterns, and no external inputs or network activity. All security signals indicate benign behavior. The only minor point is the security risk score in one report, which assigns 0.1 despite the code's simplicity and safety, which should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature; the only correction is to set the minimal security risk score to 0, aligning with the code's actual safety profile.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
