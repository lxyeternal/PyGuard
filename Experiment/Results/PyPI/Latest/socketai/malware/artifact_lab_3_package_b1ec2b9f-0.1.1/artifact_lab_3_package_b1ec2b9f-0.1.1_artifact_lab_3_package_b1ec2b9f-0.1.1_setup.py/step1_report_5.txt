{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for a Python package, specifying metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package name, version, and dependencies; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely sets up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; uses standard setup tools with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static parameters defining the package name, version, packages, and dependencies. All values are hardcoded and typical for package setup scripts. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no code injection points, and no suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code is safe to use.",
