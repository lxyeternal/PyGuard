  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup parameters for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Input data includes the package dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "Dependencies are installed; no direct sinks for untrusted data execution or data leakage are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the setup process is standard and static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is a typical setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' modules, defines package name and version, automatically finds packages, and specifies a dependency on 'requests>=2.32.3'. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated segments, or suspicious behavior. The code appears standard for package distribution and does not include malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies.",
