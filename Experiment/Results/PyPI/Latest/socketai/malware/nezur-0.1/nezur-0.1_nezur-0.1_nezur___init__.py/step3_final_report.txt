  "purpose": "A simple Python script that outputs 'hello' with no input, dependencies, or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static and only outputs a string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic print statement with no external dependencies, input handling, or complex logic. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code shows no signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The analysis confirms the code is harmless, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
