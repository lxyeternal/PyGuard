{
  "purpose": "This code outputs a static greeting message and serves as a trivial example with no external dependencies or input handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, environment variables, or inputs are read; the code is a simple print statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks, network activity, or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only executes a print statement with static content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic print statement with no inputs, external dependencies, or complex logic. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is correctly 0, as there is no malicious intent or activity. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting the code's clarity. The security risk score is 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or threats. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and consensus across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its behavior. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
