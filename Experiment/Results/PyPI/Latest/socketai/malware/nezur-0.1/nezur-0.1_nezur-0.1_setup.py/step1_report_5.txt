  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes an external executable during package installation.",
  "sources": "Download URL via Invoke-WebRequest and the subsequent execution of the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file using Start-Process which can run arbitrary code from the external source.",
  "flows": "Invoke-WebRequest downloads the executable from a remote URL; then Start-Process runs the executable, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and directly executes an external binary during package installation without verification, which is unusual and suspicious. Use of PowerShell commands embedded in setup scripts for such purposes is atypical.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard install command to download an executable from a remote URL using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest. Upon successful download, it opens the file with Start-Process. This behavior can be malicious as it allows remote code execution during package installation, potentially running malware. The download URL points to a raw GitHub content link, which is commonly used for hosting malicious files. The code does not verify the integrity or authenticity of the downloaded file. The practice of running external executables during installation is a security concern and generally considered malicious or dangerous, especially without user consent or verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external binary during package installation without any verification. This can be used for malware distribution or system compromise. The overall security risk is high.",
