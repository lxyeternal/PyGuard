{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the installation process of a Python package to download and execute an external executable file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current working directory (os.getcwd()), constructs a download URL, and executes PowerShell commands to download and open an external file.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run commands executing PowerShell to download and run an external executable (CBLines.exe).",
  "flows": "The code constructs a PowerShell command to download a file from a remote URL and then executes the downloaded file, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of PowerShell commands to silently download and execute an external executable during installation; hardcoded URL pointing to a suspicious or external source; no verification of the downloaded file; opening the file immediately after download.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard Python package installation process to include a step where it downloads an executable file from a specified URL. It uses PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest to fetch the file and then opens it with Start-Process, effectively executing the downloaded file without any validation or user consent. This behavior could allow malicious actors to distribute harmful payloads through package installation. The download URL is hardcoded and external, which is suspicious. The code does not perform any integrity checks, such as checksum verification, on the downloaded file. Overall, this pattern indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent or at least malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation, which could be used for malicious purposes such as remote code execution, malware installation, or system compromise. The implementation lacks safeguards and transparency, strongly indicating malicious intent.",
