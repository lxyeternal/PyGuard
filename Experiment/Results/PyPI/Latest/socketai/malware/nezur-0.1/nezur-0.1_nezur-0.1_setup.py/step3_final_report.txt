{
  "purpose": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to download and execute an external executable during package installation, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the external URL via PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest and from the filesystem when checking for the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via PowerShell's Start-Process, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a PowerShell command to download the executable from the URL, saves it locally, then executes it immediately, creating a source-to-sink flow from URL to process execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional download and execution of an external file during installation without validation, checksum, or user consent; use of PowerShell commands with shell=True; no validation or verification of the downloaded file.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a high-risk operation by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation without validation, indicating malicious intent. The process is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the behavior aligns with common supply chain attack patterns. The use of PowerShell commands to silently download and run external code is suspicious and dangerous. The lack of validation or user prompts further exacerbates the risk. Given these factors, the malware score is set to 1, and the security risk score is also 1, reflecting the high severity of this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by downloading and executing external code during installation without validation. This pattern is indicative of malware or backdoor activity, posing a severe security threat. The scores are consistent with the behavior, and the overall assessment indicates that this package should be considered malicious and avoided.",
