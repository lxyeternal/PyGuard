{
  "purpose": "To customize the installation process by downloading and executing a remote file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the internet via PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest and then executes the downloaded file using Start-Process.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file with Start-Process can lead to arbitrary code execution if the downloaded content is malicious.",
  "flows": "The code downloads a file from a remote URL and then executes it, forming a source-to-sink flow that can execute arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation is unusual and suspicious behavior. The URL points to a GitHub raw link, which is often used to host malicious payloads. The code does not verify the download's integrity or authenticity.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard installation process to perform a PowerShell download of an executable from a remote URL. If successful, it immediately runs the downloaded file. This behavior can be malicious if the file is harmful. No validation or verification of the downloaded file is performed. The use of PowerShell commands for download and execution during setup is suspicious and indicative of potential malicious intent, especially since it occurs automatically during package install. The rest of the setup code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external file during package installation without verification. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent or sabotage, posing a significant security risk.",
