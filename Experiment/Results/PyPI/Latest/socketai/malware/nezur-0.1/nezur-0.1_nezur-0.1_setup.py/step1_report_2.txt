{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to download and execute a remote executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe' for downloading the file, and the current working directory for saving the file.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file is executed using PowerShell's Start-Process, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "The source (remote URL) flows into the download command, saving to a local file, which then flows into the execution command that runs the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from an external source during installation and immediately executes it without validation or user consent, which is highly suspicious behavior. The process bypasses user control and can be used to run malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard installation process to include a step that downloads an executable file from an external URL. It then executes this file directly using PowerShell, without any checks, validation, or user interaction. This behavior is characteristic of malicious supply chain attacks, as it can run arbitrary malicious code during package installation. The use of PowerShell commands and immediate execution of the downloaded file are strong indicators of malicious intent. There are no obfuscations or code complexities that suggest benign purposes; instead, it looks designed to silently download and run potentially harmful software.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation, which could compromise user systems. This behavior indicates malicious intent or severe security risk, making this package highly unsafe to use.",
