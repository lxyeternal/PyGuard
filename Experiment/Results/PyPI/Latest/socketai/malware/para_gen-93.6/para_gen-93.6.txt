      "conclusion": "The code executes external code ('main()') during installation, which is a security concern and could be exploited for malicious purposes. While no malicious code is confirmed, the pattern itself warrants caution. The scores should be adjusted to reflect a moderate to high potential for malicious activity, with malware around 0.5-0.7 and security risk around 0.5-0.6."

      "conclusion": "The script performs covert data collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating potentially malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. While it lacks direct malicious payloads, its behavior is characteristic of spyware or tracking tools. The malware score should be adjusted to reflect this, and the overall security risk remains high due to privacy implications."
