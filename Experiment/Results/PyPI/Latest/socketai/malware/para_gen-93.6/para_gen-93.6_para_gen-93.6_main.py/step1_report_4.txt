{
  "purpose": "Collect system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data to several remote URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "Reads system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), executes system commands ('getmac' or 'ifconfig') to obtain MAC addresses, and generates a random number.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP GET requests to external URLs constructed with encoded data and parameters, potentially leaking system info.",
  "flows": "Source data (system info, MAC addresses) is encoded and included as URL parameters, then transmitted over network to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded URLs that point to suspicious or obscure domains. Encodes MAC addresses in base64 before transmission, which can be a method of obfuscation. No authentication or encryption of data, only simple URL requests. Exception handling is silent, providing no error reporting or logging.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system data such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current working directory. It encodes MAC addresses in base64, possibly to obfuscate data. The data is sent via GET requests to external domains that appear suspicious and are possibly malicious or used for tracking. The URLs are obscure, and the script runs without user consent, which is characteristic of potentially malicious data exfiltration. The silent exception handling masks potential errors, which could be used to avoid detection. No malicious payloads like reverse shells or data theft beyond system info are present, but the network activity and obfuscation raise concerns about privacy invasion and covert data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs covert data collection and exfiltration of system information to suspicious domains without user consent, with obfuscation techniques employed. While it does not include obvious malicious payloads like malware installation or system damage, it poses privacy and security risks due to its covert communication with unknown servers.",
