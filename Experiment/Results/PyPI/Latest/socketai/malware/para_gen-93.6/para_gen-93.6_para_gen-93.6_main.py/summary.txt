  "conclusion": "The script performs covert data collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating potentially malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. While it lacks direct malicious payloads, its behavior is characteristic of spyware or tracking tools. The malware score should be adjusted to reflect this, and the overall security risk remains high due to privacy implications."
