  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which reads system-specific network interfaces to extract MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send HTTP GET requests with encoded system data to external domains.",
  "flows": "Data from platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), and MAC addresses are gathered, encoded in base64, assembled into URL parameters, and sent via HTTP GET requests to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain names (oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast-row.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) suggests potential C2 or data exfiltration points. The code does not validate or restrict these URLs. The MAC addresses are encoded and transmitted without user consent. No user prompts or logs; silent data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The script collects identifiable system information, including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses from the system. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, assembles the data into URL parameters, and makes HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs that appear suspicious. No data validation, error handling is minimal, and data is transmitted without user awareness. The external URLs are unusual and seem designed for tracking or command-and-control purposes. The code does not perform any malicious system modifications but collects and transmits potentially sensitive data surreptitiously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed for stealthy data collection and exfiltration of system identifiers to external servers. It does not contain direct destructive actions but has privacy violations and potential for malicious use as part of a larger malicious framework. The presence of suspicious URLs and silent data transmission elevate its risk profile.",
