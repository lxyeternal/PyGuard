{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and exfiltrates this data via HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system commands, and the URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls transmitting data to external URLs, potentially leading to data leakage or privacy violations.",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources flows into URL parameters, which are then sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling during network requests, use of suspicious or obfuscated URLs, base64 encoding of MAC addresses as a mild obfuscation, and covert data exfiltration behavior without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system identifiers and network info, encodes MAC addresses with base64, and transmits this data to suspicious external URLs. The silent exception handling and use of obscure domains suggest covert operation. No malicious payloads like code execution or damage are present, but the pattern indicates potential privacy invasion and data exfiltration. The encoding adds minimal obfuscation. The behavior aligns with tracking or spyware activities rather than outright malware, but the exfiltration pattern warrants concern.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs covert data collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating potentially malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. While it lacks direct malicious payloads, its behavior is characteristic of spyware or tracking tools. The malware score should be adjusted to reflect this, and the overall security risk remains high due to privacy implications.",
