{
  "purpose": "This setup script is designed to install a Python package named 'para-gen' and execute a function from the 'main' module after installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules for package setup and defines a custom install command which imports 'main' and calls its 'main' function during installation.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function from the 'main' module is invoked during the install process; this is a potential sink if 'main' executes untrusted or malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'CrazyInstallStrat' class executes, which runs the standard installation process and then calls 'main()' from 'main', creating a flow from package install to execution of external code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes executing 'main()' from 'main' immediately after installation, which can be exploited to run arbitrary code at install time. The code imports 'requests' and 'psutil' but does not use them explicitly, which may be benign or suspicious depending on 'main'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that runs the standard install process and then calls 'main()' from an external module. This is a common pattern for post-install scripts but can be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful code. There are no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The use of 'setuptools' is standard, but executing external code during install is potentially risky. No signs of malicious data exfiltration or network activity are visible in this script alone, but the invocation of 'main()' is a notable point of concern.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard package setup but executes external code ('main') during installation, which could be malicious if 'main' contains harmful operations. Caution is advised, especially if the contents of 'main' are unknown.",
