  "conclusion": "The code executes external code ('main()') during installation, which is a security concern and could be exploited for malicious purposes. While no malicious code is confirmed, the pattern itself warrants caution. The scores should be adjusted to reflect a moderate to high potential for malicious activity, with malware around 0.5-0.7 and security risk around 0.5-0.6."
