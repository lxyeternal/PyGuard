  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that runs a main function after installation",
  "sources": "The import of 'main' from the local module 'main' within the custom install class",
  "sinks": "Calling main() in the custom install command; potential execution of arbitrary code in 'main'",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method executes and imports 'main', then calls 'main()'",
  "anomalies": "Custom installation class executing code ('main()') upon installation, which is unusual and potentially risky",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, after performing the standard installation, imports and executes a function 'main' from a local module 'main'. This behavior can be used to execute arbitrary code during package installation, which is unconventional and potentially malicious. The code itself does not contain malicious logic but executing code during install is often considered suspicious, especially if the 'main' module or function is unknown. The setup dependencies seem benign ('requests', 'psutil'), but the execution of 'main()' warrants caution. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present, but the pattern of code execution during install is noteworthy.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a function 'main()' from a local module during installation, which is unusual and could be exploited for malicious purposes if 'main()' contains malicious code. Overall, the script's behavior is suspicious due to executing arbitrary code during setup, but there is no concrete evidence of malicious intent in the provided code itself.",
