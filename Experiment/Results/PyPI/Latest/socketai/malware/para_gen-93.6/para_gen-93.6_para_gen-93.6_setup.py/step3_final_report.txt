{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that, after performing the standard setup, imports and executes the 'main()' function from the 'main' module during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data during the import of 'main' and execution of 'main()' in the 'run()' method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of 'main()' during installation acts as a sink where untrusted or malicious code could execute.",
  "flows": "The flow begins at the install process, proceeds to import 'main', and then executes 'main()', potentially running arbitrary code during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual execution of external code ('main()') during package installation, which is not standard practice and could be exploited.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the installation process to run 'main()' after the standard setup, which is atypical and poses security risks. This pattern allows arbitrary code execution at install time, which could be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful operations. The code itself is straightforward, with no obfuscation or secrets, but the behavior is suspicious. Given the pattern, the risk of malicious activity is moderate to high, especially if 'main()' is untrusted. The scores should reflect this concern, with a malware score around 0.5-0.7 and a security risk around 0.5-0.6.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes external code ('main()') during installation, which is a security concern and could be exploited for malicious purposes. While no malicious code is confirmed, the pattern itself warrants caution. The scores should be adjusted to reflect a moderate to high potential for malicious activity, with malware around 0.5-0.7 and security risk around 0.5-0.6.",
