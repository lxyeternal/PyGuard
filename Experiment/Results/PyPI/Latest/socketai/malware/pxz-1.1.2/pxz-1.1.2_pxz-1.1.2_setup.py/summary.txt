  "conclusion": "The code performs automatic, covert collection and transmission of system information during package import, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The behavior constitutes privacy violation and data exfiltration, justifying high malware and security risk scores. The reports' assessments and scores are consistent with the observed behavior."
