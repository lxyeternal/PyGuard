{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to define a Python package setup process and, upon execution, collect and send system information to a specified server.",
  "sources": "Input sources include system commands (curl via os.popen), environment and system properties (os.uname, os.path.expanduser, os.getcwd), and network requests (requests.post).",
  "sinks": "Network request to a potentially malicious or unauthorized server (http://10.0.2.15:8080). No other significant sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system commands and properties flows into a JSON object sent via requests.post to the specified IP address.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically collects sensitive system info (public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory) and exfiltrates it without user consent. Use of 'curl' via os.popen for system info is a suspicious practice. The server URL appears to be a private/internal IP, which could indicate malicious exfiltration or testing environment. The setup code is standard, but the immediate data exfiltration on module load is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules (setuptools, os) and requests. It defines a function 'collect_system_info' that gathers public IP via a system call, hostname, home directory, and current directory. It then sends this data to a specified internal IP address. This behavior is typical of malicious scripts aiming to exfiltrate system info. The setup() function is standard for packaging but is executed as part of the script, leading to data collection on import. No obfuscation, malware, or other malicious code constructs are present, but the behavior (automatic data exfiltration) is malicious. The script is designed to run immediately upon import, which is suspicious and indicates potential malicious intent or privacy violation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and sending it to an internal IP address without user consent. This pattern indicates data exfiltration, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The setup configuration is standard but combined with the data collection makes the overall behavior malicious.",
