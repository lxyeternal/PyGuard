{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to define a Python package setup configuration and to collect and send system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The system information collection function reads data from system commands (curl, uname), environment variables, and the current working directory; the requests library sends data over the network.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post function sends collected system info to a specified IP address, potentially leaking system details.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system command outputs and environment queries into a dictionary, which is then transmitted via HTTP POST to an external IP address.",
  "anomalies": "The code unconditionally collects sensitive system data and sends it to an internal IP address (10.0.2.15) without user consent or obvious necessity. Usage of curl through os.popen may be insecure or unreliable. The collected data includes public IP, hostname, user home, and current directory, which could be used maliciously if intercepted or misused.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up a Python package but also immediately executes a function to collect system info and send it to a specified internal server. This behavior resembles data exfiltration rather than typical package setup. The network request is embedded within the module, executing upon import, which is unusual and suspicious. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present, but the immediate and automatic data transmission without user notification or consent raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform unauthorized collection and transmission of system information, which could be malicious. Its primary malicious aspect is the covert data exfiltration embedded within a package setup script, which is highly suspicious and likely malicious behavior.",
