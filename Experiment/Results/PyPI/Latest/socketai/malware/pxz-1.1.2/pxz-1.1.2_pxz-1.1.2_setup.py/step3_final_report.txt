{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory) and sends it to a specified internal IP address during module import, embedded within the setup script.",
  "sources": "The function collect_system_info() reads data from system commands and environment variables: 'curl' command via os.popen, os.uname(), os.path.expanduser('~'), os.getcwd().",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via requests.post() to 'http://10.0.2.15:8080', transmitting potentially sensitive system info to an internal server.",
  "flows": "Source data (system info) flows from system commands and environment variables into the system_info dictionary, then flows into the requests.post() call, transmitting data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "The immediate execution of data collection and transmission during module import without user consent; use of 'curl' via os.popen() is insecure; hardcoded internal IP address; no notification or consent mechanism.",
  "analysis": "The code unconditionally executes collect_system_info() at import, which gathers sensitive system data and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded internal IP address. The data collection uses system commands and environment variables, which are standard but are exploited here for covert data exfiltration. The transmission occurs silently during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The behavior aligns with malicious activity, specifically unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, which compromises user privacy. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75-0.8, security risk ~0.75-0.8) are appropriate given the behavior. The code lacks payloads or obfuscation, so obfuscated score remains 0. The high risk score reflects the privacy violation and potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs automatic, covert collection and transmission of system information during package import, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The behavior constitutes privacy violation and data exfiltration, justifying high malware and security risk scores. The reports' assessments and scores are consistent with the observed behavior.",
