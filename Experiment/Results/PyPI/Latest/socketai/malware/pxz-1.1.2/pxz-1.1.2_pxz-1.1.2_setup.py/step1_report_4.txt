  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration and includes a function that collects system information and sends it to a specified server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system data such as public IP address, hostname, home directory, and current directory. It also reads the package metadata.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post function transmits collected system information to an external server, which can be exploited for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The system info collection (source) flows into the requests.post call (sink), transmitting data to an external IP address.",
  "anomalies": "The function collect_system_info() runs automatically upon import, which is unusual for setup scripts. The code sends potentially sensitive information without user consent. The target IP (10.0.2.15) is a private/internal IP, possibly indicating testing, but still suspicious as it is hardcoded. Use of os.popen with curl command can be insecure and unreliable.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup, os, and requests modules. It defines a function to collect system information, including public IP, hostname, home directory, and current directory. The function executes a curl command via os.popen to obtain the public IP and gathers other system info through os and os.path methods. It then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded internal IP address. The function is called immediately, leading to automatic execution upon module import, which is atypical for setup files. The setup() call follows, defining package metadata and dependencies. The code's behavior of collecting and transmitting system info without explicit user permission is suspicious, especially given the hardcoded IP address and immediate execution at import time.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits potentially malicious behavior by automatically collecting and transmitting system information to an internal IP address without user consent. The immediate execution of the data transmission function during import, combined with the hardcoded destination, suggests an attempt at stealth data exfiltration. The package setup appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the suspicious data collection activity.",
