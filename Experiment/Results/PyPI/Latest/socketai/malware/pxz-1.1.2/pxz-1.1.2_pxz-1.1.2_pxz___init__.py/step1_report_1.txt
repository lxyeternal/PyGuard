  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing or automation tasks.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, imported modules, and potentially user inputs or external data sources accessed via functions or network calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file system writes, or system commands that could be used to exfiltrate data or execute malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or external inputs through processing functions to sinks like network sockets, files, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or obscure obfuscation detected. Unusual code patterns, such as dynamic execution, are absent. No obvious backdoors or malicious payloads observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and performs straightforward operations. It reads data from environment variables or external modules and processes them accordingly. No unsafe or suspicious behavior is evident. The structure suggests normal data handling, with no evidence of malicious intent such as network exfiltration, command injection, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The reviewed code appears benign and does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It follows standard coding practices without anomalies or signs of sabotage.",
