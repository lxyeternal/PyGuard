  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to specified URLs for monitoring or tracking purposes.",

  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to external URLs",
  "flows": "System info sources (hostname, username, current_path) → URL encoding → HTTP GET request to external URLs",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded URLs pointing to suspicious domains, sending potentially sensitive system info without user consent, no input validation or user notification.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, and current directory, then constructs URLs with these parameters along with a random number. It performs HTTP GET requests to these URLs, potentially leaking system details. The URLs are on suspicious domains which could be malicious or tracking services. The code lacks any user notification, encryption, or safeguards, indicating possible privacy violation or malicious intent. No obfuscation or malicious payload execution is present, but the data exfiltration is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be collecting system info and transmitting it to external, suspicious domains, likely for tracking or malicious purposes. It does not contain active malicious payloads like malware, but it poses privacy and security concerns due to unconsented data transmission.",
