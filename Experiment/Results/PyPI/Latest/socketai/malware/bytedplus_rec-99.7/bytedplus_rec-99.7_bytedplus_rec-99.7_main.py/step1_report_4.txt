  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, current directory) and send it to remote URLs with a random identifier.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to external URLs",
  "flows": "Gather system info -> encode URL with parameters -> send to external URLs via HTTP GET requests",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with obfuscated domain names; transmission of potentially sensitive info (hostname, username, directory) to external servers; use of random number as a unique identifier; no user consent or transparency; silent failure logging",
  "analysis": "The script collects system hostname, username, current working directory, and generates a random number. It constructs URLs to three external domains, appending the collected data as URL parameters. It then attempts to open each URL, logging success or failure. The external domains appear suspicious, and transmitting environment info without user knowledge suggests possible malicious intent. The code does not perform any apparent useful function beyond data exfiltration, indicating malicious behavior. No obfuscation is present; the code structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates system information to suspicious external servers without user consent, indicating malicious intent with data collection and transmission. It appears designed for unauthorized data collection or surveillance.",
