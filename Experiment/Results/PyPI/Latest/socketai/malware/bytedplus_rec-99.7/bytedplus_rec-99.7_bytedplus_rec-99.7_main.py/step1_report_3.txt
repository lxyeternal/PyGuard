  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to multiple remote URLs with a randomized identifier.",

  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() with constructed URLs containing system info and a random number",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, current path) -> URL construction -> URL request (send data to remote servers)",
  "anomalies": "Data collection of hostname, username, and current directory combined with remote URLs suggests possible tracking; use of multiple suspicious domains; no user consent prompt; potential for covert data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers basic system info (hostname, username, current directory), generates a random number, and constructs URLs pointing to potentially malicious or suspicious domains. It then sends this data via GET requests to those URLs, possibly to track or identify the user system. The domains used are obscure and associated with malicious domains, indicating possible malicious intent. There is no apparent legitimate purpose for sending this data silently. The code lacks any user interaction, logging of sensitive info locally, or encryption, which increases suspicion. The URL endpoints do not appear to serve legitimate purposes and may be used for tracking or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect system information and silently transmit it to suspicious external servers, indicative of potentially malicious tracking or reconnaissance activity. It does not contain obfuscation but exhibits behavior typical of data exfiltration or tracking malware.",
