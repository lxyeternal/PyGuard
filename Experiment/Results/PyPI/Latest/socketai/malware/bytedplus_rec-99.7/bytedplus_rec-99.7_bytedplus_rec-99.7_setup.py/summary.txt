  "conclusion": "The code executes 'main()' during installation, which poses a significant security risk if 'main()' contains malicious code. This pattern is suspicious and can be exploited for malicious purposes, making the package potentially dangerous. The scores reflect this risk, with high malware and security risk scores justified by the behavior. Further review of 'main.py' is recommended to assess actual malicious content."
