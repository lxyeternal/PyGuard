    "Use of subprocess to obtain system UUID (HWID) which can be used for identification"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script is structured to gather sensitive system data, including system identifiers, user credentials, and tokens, from multiple sources. It uses base64-encoded URLs to obfuscate the remote endpoints, which are then decoded and used to send data. The collection methods are typical of malicious tools designed for data theft and exfiltration. The code also quietly handles errors, which can conceal failures or suspicious activity. The overall pattern indicates intent to harvest user data and transmit it to external servers without user consent, fitting the profile of malicious spyware or data-stealing malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates malicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration and espionage, collecting sensitive user information and sending it to external servers. The obfuscation via base64 encoding and broad exception handling further suggest malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered dangerous for use.",
