{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts, then exfiltrates this data to external webhooks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, filesystem paths for Discord, Chrome, and Minecraft data, and system commands for HWID; also, URL decoding from base64 strings.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the requests.post() calls sending data to decoded URLs, which exfiltrate sensitive information over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (filesystem, environment, system commands) into data collection functions, then through string formatting, and finally into requests.post() calls to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded URLs for obfuscation, broad exception handling hiding errors, and collection of sensitive data without user consent are notable anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The script decodes multiple base64 URLs used as webhooks, collects system info, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts, then exfiltrates this data via HTTP POST requests. It employs broad exception handling, which can conceal errors, and obfuscates webhook URLs through base64 encoding. The data collection methods involve filesystem access, environment variables, system commands, and database queries, all consistent with malicious data theft. The code's behavior aligns with typical malware designed for privacy invasion and unauthorized data exfiltration. No destructive payloads or persistence mechanisms are present, but the scope and stealth of data theft justify high maliciousness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, performing extensive data theft and exfiltration using obfuscation techniques. It should be classified with maximum malware and security risk scores, reflecting its high threat level.",
