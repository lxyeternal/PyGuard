{
  "purpose": "The script gathers system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data, then sends this data to multiple external webhooks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, user directories, local storage files, and system commands like 'wmic'.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to external URLs decoded from base64-encoded strings, potentially exfiltrating sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables, files, and system commands is collected into strings; these are then sent to external URLs via requests.post calls.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded URLs are decoded from base64, suggesting obfuscation; the script collects potentially sensitive info (tokens, passwords, system info) and exfiltrates it without user consent; exception handling suppresses errors silently; passwords are not decrypted, only base64-encoded, which indicates incomplete data collection; multiple webhook URLs are hardcoded and obfuscated. No explicit backdoors or malicious payloads are evident, but the data collection and exfiltration behavior are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to collect various sensitive data: system info (user, PC name, HWID, IP), Discord tokens from specific directories, saved browser passwords from Chrome, and Minecraft account details from specific config files. All these are stored in strings and then sent to multiple external URLs that are decoded from base64, indicating an intent to hide their destination URLs. The code employs exception handling that suppresses errors, which could conceal failures or detection. The data exfiltration mechanism is straightforward, using requests.post to external URLs, potentially indicating malicious intent or a malware-like behavior aimed at data theft. The obfuscation through base64 and the targeting of multiple data sources are typical of malicious scripts aiming to gather information stealthily. No code shows signs of persistence mechanisms, backdoors, or malicious payload execution beyond data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The script's primary purpose appears to be clandestine collection and exfiltration of sensitive user data, with obfuscated URLs and comprehensive data gathering. This behavior aligns with malicious data theft, though no explicit destructive actions or malware functions are present. Its behavior warrants caution due to privacy violations and potential misuse.",
