{
  "purpose": "The script collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, Minecraft account details, and then sends this data to multiple webhooks. It appears designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data without user consent.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, file system paths (leveldb files, login data, account configs), executing system commands, and network requests to external URLs decoded from base64 strings.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external URLs (webhooks) using requests.post, reading potentially sensitive data from local storage, executing subprocess commands, and accessing environment variables.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables, files, and system commands feed data into variables and functions that process and then send the data via network requests (sinks). Data from system info, tokens, passwords, and accounts flow into the send_to_webhook function, which exfiltrates the data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated URLs decoded from base64, multiple attempts to exfiltrate diverse sensitive data types, use of broad exception handling that suppresses errors, collection of Discord tokens and browser passwords, and gathering system identifiers such as HWID. The code also includes dynamic URL decoding and multiple data exfiltration points without user consent. The function 'color' appears to be an odd wrapper for the exfiltration process, possibly intended to hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by decoding multiple base64-encoded URLs, which are then used as webhooks for data exfiltration. Functions collect sensitive user data: system info, Discord tokens, saved browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts. The data is formatted and sent to multiple webhooks. The use of broad exception handling and the dynamic, obfuscated URL strings suggest an intent to hide malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate functions; instead, it stealthily gathers and transmits user data, consistent with data theft or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script exhibits clear malicious intent, primarily aimed at exfiltrating sensitive user data to remote servers. It employs obfuscation and multiple exfiltration points, characteristic of malware designed for data theft and privacy invasion. The overall security risk score is high, and the malware probability is also elevated due to the data collection and transmission activities.",
