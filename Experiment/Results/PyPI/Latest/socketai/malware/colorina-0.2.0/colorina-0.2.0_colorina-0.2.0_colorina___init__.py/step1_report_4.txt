  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data, then send this information to multiple URLs encoded in base64, likely as a form of data exfiltration.",
  "sources": [
    "Base64 encoded URLs decoded at the beginning for webhook endpoints",
    "os.getlogin() for username",
    "os.getenv() for environment variables (COMPUTERNAME, LOCALAPPDATA, USERPROFILE)",

  "anomalies": [
    "Use of hardcoded base64-encoded URLs for webhooks",
    "Data collection includes potentially sensitive information (system info, tokens, passwords, account data)",
    "No validation or encryption of data before transmission",
    "Multiple external webhook URLs to exfiltrate data, possibly to attacker-controlled endpoints",
    "Execution of system commands to retrieve hardware UUIDs",
    "Lack of user consent prompts or warnings",
    "Possible malicious intent to harvest user data without user awareness"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script is designed to gather extensive system information, including user and hardware details, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account credentials. It then sends this data via HTTP POST requests to multiple URLs decoded from base64, which strongly indicates data exfiltration. The use of requests to send data, reading sensitive files, executing system commands, and harvesting tokens and passwords are typical behaviors associated with malicious spyware or info-stealing malware. No obfuscation of core logic beyond base64 URLs is observed, but the purpose and behavior are clearly malicious, aligning with typical info-stealer malware patterns. The code lacks any user notification or consent, reinforcing its malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed for data exfiltration of sensitive user information, including system details, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data. It communicates with attacker-controlled webhook URLs, indicating intent to harvest and transmit private user data without consent. It is highly dangerous and should not be used.",
