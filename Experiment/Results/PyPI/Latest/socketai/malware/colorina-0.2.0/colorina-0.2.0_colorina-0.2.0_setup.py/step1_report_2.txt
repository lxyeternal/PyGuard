  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'setup' function from the 'setuptools' library.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths in this minimal setup script.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal with only a single call to setup() without arguments; no anomalies or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and immediately calls it with default parameters. This is a standard minimal setup script used in Python packaging. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual constructs. No input or external data reading occurs, and the setup() function is called without any arguments, indicating default behavior. The script is too simplistic to contain obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard minimal setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, benign package setup script.",
