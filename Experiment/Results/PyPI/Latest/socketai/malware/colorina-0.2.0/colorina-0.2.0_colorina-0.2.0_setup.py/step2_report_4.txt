  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: importing `setuptools` and calling `setup()` with no arguments.\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data flows.\n- The code is extremely minimal, which is typical for placeholder or template setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code is exactly as described; no additional code, parameters, or external input is present.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Data flows:** None; the script is static and simple.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only potential concern is that calling `setup()` with no arguments is unusual but not suspicious. It might be a placeholder or incomplete script, but not malicious.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **malware:** 0\n  - **obfuscated:** 0\n  - **securityRisk:** 0\n  - **confidence:** 1\n\nThese scores seem appropriate given the analysis.\n\n### Justification of risk scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or data flows are present, a **risk score of 0.5 or higher** would be unjustified.\n- The minimal code is benign, and the reports correctly reflect that.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, minimal setup script with no security concerns.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code, with no suspicious activity or vulnerabilities present.",
