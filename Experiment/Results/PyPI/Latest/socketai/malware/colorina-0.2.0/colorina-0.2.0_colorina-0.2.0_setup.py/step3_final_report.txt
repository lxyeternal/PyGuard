  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for Python packaging, importing setuptools and calling setup() with no arguments.",
  "sources": "No external input, data flows, or data reading; static code only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks, network activity, or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code executes without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of parameters in setup(), no arguments, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, minimal setup script used in Python packaging. It imports setuptools and calls setup() with no arguments, indicating a placeholder or default configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The code's simplicity and lack of external data or network activity confirm its benign nature. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent, and no adjustments are necessary.",
