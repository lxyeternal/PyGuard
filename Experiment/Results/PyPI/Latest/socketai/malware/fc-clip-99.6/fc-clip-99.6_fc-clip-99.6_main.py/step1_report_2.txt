  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data to external URLs for remote tracking or data collection.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), network addresses (via subprocess), and generates random numbers.",
  "sinks": "URL requests to external servers constructed with collected data, potentially sending sensitive system info over the network.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered and encoded; URLs are constructed with this data; then data is transmitted via HTTP requests to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 encoding and decoding of URLs, which could obscure malicious intent. Sends system details to multiple external domains without clear user consent. The URLs point to domains with suspicious or non-descriptive names. The URL requests are made silently without verification or logging.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system details such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. It encodes MAC addresses in base64. It constructs URLs from hardcoded base64-encoded domains, then sends HTTP GET requests with these parameters. There is no user interaction, no validation, and the network activity occurs transparently. The code does not perform any malicious actions locally but appears designed to exfiltrate system data to remote servers, which is a hallmark of potentially malicious or tracking behavior. No obfuscated or malware-specific functions are present; however, the silent data transmission without user knowledge is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script primarily collects system info and exfiltrates it via encoded URLs to external domains. This behavior is typical of data-collection or tracking malware. Although no direct malicious actions like file damage or reverse shells are observed, the silent exfiltration constitutes a security concern. The code's intent appears to be surveillance or unauthorized data collection.",
