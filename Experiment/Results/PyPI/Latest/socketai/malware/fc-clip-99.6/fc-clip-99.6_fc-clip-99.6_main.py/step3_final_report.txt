{
  "purpose": "The code collects system hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and sends this information via HTTP GET requests to external URLs, obfuscated with base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), MAC addresses via subprocess commands.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to external servers, with parameters including hostname, username, directory, and MAC addresses.",
  "flows": "Source functions (system info collection) feed into URL construction with encoded parameters, which are then transmitted via network requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with shell=True, silent exception handling, base64 encoding of URLs and MAC addresses to obfuscate intent, no user consent or notification, and data exfiltration without validation.",
  "analysis": "The script covertly gathers system information and transmits it to external servers without user awareness, employing obfuscation techniques like base64 encoding. No malicious payloads such as code execution or destructive actions are present, but the behavior indicates privacy-invasive data exfiltration. Silent error handling and obfuscated URLs suggest an intent to conceal the activity. The use of subprocess with shell=True, while not inherently malicious here, can be risky and is typical in obfuscated or malicious scripts. Overall, the code functions as a covert data collection tool, which is suspicious and potentially malicious depending on context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert exfiltration of system information, indicating privacy invasion and potential malicious intent. While it does not contain active malware like code execution or destructive payloads, its covert and obfuscated nature warrants high security concern. The malware score should be moderate, reflecting malicious-like behavior without direct malicious payloads, and the overall security risk is high due to privacy invasion and covert communication.",
