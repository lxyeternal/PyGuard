{
  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, user, MAC addresses, and current directory, then send this data to multiple remote URLs for reporting or tracking purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system info via platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), and network interfaces through subprocess commands.",
  "sinks": "Constructed URLs with parameters containing system data, sent via urllib.request.urlopen() to external servers.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC address) is gathered and encoded, then included as URL parameters in HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for URLs and MAC addresses; multiple external URLs hardcoded; no validation or encryption of data before transmission; silent exception handling that suppresses errors.",
  "analysis": "The script collects potentially sensitive system information, encodes some data in base64, and transmits it via GET requests to three hardcoded external URLs. The data collection includes MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current working directory, which could be used for fingerprinting or tracking. The URLs are obfuscated with base64 decoding, possibly to conceal the target addresses. The network communication occurs without user consent, and the exception handling silently ignores failures, which could hide malfunctions or detection. Overall, the code performs data exfiltration with no user interaction or explicit disclosure, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a data exfiltration tool gathering system details and sending them to external servers without user consent. It does not contain explicit malicious payloads like code execution or backdoors but functions as a privacy-invasive tracker or part of a command-and-control communication mechanism. The obfuscation and silent error handling increase suspicion. Overall risk is high due to covert data transmission, despite no direct system damage or malware actions.",
