{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the installation of the 'fc-clip' package and executes a function from the main module during installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and executes 'm()' from 'main' during the custom install step.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'm()' from the 'main' module during install could be a sink if 'm()' executes untrusted or malicious code.",
  "flows": "The installation process triggers 'run()' in 'CrazyInstallStrat', which then imports and executes 'm()' from 'main', potentially executing arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "The class 'CrazyInstallStrat' executes a function 'm()' from 'main' during installation, which is unusual for a setup script. This dynamic execution at install time is a potential concern.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, after running the standard install process, imports and executes a function 'm()' from 'main'. This behavior is atypical for setup scripts, which usually only install dependencies and files. The code does not hardcode credentials or perform obvious malicious actions but executing 'm()' during installation could be exploited to run malicious code if 'main' contains harmful logic. The use of 'requests' and 'psutil' as dependencies does not indicate malicious intent on their own. The overall risk depends on what 'm()' does, which is not visible here. However, the pattern of executing arbitrary code during package installation is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a function 'm()' from the 'main' module during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious depending on the implementation of 'm()'. This pattern could allow malicious code to run without user awareness during package installation, representing a security concern.",
