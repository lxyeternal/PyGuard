  "purpose": "The setup script executes a function m() from main during installation, which is suspicious as it allows arbitrary code execution at install time.",
  "sources": "Importing main and calling m() after the standard install process.",
  "sinks": "Execution of m(), which can run arbitrary code, potentially malicious payloads, or backdoors.",
  "flows": "Standard install process -> import main -> execute m() -> run arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external code during setup, which is atypical and risky.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, after performing the normal installation, imports main and calls m(). This pattern is unusual and can be exploited if m() contains malicious code. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation. The pattern of executing code during install is a common supply chain attack vector. The risk and malware scores should be high due to the potential for malicious payloads, but without inspecting main.py, the exact maliciousness cannot be confirmed. The current reports generally recognize this pattern and assign high scores, which are justified. The scores should be slightly increased to reflect the severity of executing arbitrary code during setup, with malware scores around 0.8 and risk scores around 0.8-0.85.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes m() from main during installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. This pattern poses a significant supply chain security risk, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, though they could be slightly elevated to reflect the severity more accurately.",
