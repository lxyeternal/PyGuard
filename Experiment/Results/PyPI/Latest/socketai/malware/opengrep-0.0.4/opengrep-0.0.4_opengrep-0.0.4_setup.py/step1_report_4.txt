  "sources": "Reading the VERSION variable, import of setuptools modules, and package configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential security impacts are present in this setup script.",
  "flows": "Initialization of package metadata and dependencies, no flow of untrusted data or user input through the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and configuration for distribution via setuptools. It uses static variables and standard library calls. No untrusted data input, no external command execution, and no suspicious code logic. The dependencies are explicitly listed and benign. The setup configuration is typical and does not contain any hidden or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security issues.",
