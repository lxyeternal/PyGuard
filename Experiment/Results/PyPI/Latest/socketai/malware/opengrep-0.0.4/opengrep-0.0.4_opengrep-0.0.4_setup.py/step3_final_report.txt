  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'opengrep' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration without dynamic or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward 'setup.py' script using setuptools, with static metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. All dependencies are common packages, and the script does not perform any runtime operations beyond package configuration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, straightforward structure.",
