  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'opengrep', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading version string, importing setuptools, package metadata, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of package metadata and dependencies without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The setup script is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All values are hardcoded and standard for package setup. No user input, environment variables, or external data is used in a manner that could lead to malicious behavior. The script performs no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate, standard package configuration with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It simply defines the package metadata, dependencies, and console entry points.",
