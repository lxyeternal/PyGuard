      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior typical of covert data collection, with external hostname reporting and error suppression. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, the pattern suggests potential privacy risks. The malware score is low, but the security risk is moderate, necessitating cautious review and possible restrictions in production environments."
