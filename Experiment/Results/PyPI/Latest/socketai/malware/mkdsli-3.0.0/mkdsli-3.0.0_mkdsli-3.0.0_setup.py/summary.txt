  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during installation, transmitting system info to a suspicious URL. The behavior warrants high malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated and does not contain malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration. The overall assessment indicates a high-confidence malicious activity, and the package should be flagged accordingly."
