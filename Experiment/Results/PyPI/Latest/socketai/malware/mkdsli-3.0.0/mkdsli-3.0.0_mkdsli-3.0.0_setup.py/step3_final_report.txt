{
  "purpose": "The code extends the setuptools installation process with a custom class that, during installation, collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL, performing silent data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external URL",
  "flows": "System info sources flow into requests.get() which transmits data to the external server during package installation",
  "anomalies": "Silent data exfiltration during installation, use of suspicious URL, no user notification or consent, straightforward code with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs a covert collection of system info and transmits it to a suspicious domain during package installation, indicating malicious intent. The URL is suspicious, and the behavior is privacy-invasive. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The data flow is direct and occurs without user awareness. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack patterns involving data exfiltration. The scores in the reports reflect high suspicion, with malware scores ranging from 0.25 to 0.9 and risk scores from 0.6 to 0.9. Given the clear malicious behavior, the malware score should be set at 0.9, and the security risk at 0.9, to accurately represent the severity.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during installation, transmitting system info to a suspicious URL. The behavior warrants high malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated and does not contain malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration. The overall assessment indicates a high-confidence malicious activity, and the package should be flagged accordingly.",
