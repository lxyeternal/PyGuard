  "purpose": "Custom installation process that collects system information and reports it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() used to gather hostname, current working directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() sends collected data to a remote URL.",
  "flows": "During the run() method of the CustomInstall class, data from sources is sent via HTTP GET request to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded URL for data exfiltration; data is collected silently during installation without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to include an HTTP request that transmits system hostname, current directory, and username to a remote server. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration or tracking, which is malicious if done without user awareness. The code uses standard libraries for data collection and a common HTTP library for data transmission, without obfuscation or encryption. No other suspicious code or backdoors are present. The main concern is the silent collection and transmission of system info during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by secretly collecting and sending user system information to an external server during package installation. This is indicative of a supply chain attack or privacy violation.",
