  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process with a custom installation step that sends system information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with external URL",
  "flows": "Collect hostname, current working directory, and username, then send this data via HTTP GET request to an external server during installation",
  "anomalies": "Sending system information (hostname, cwd, username) to an external server during package install without user consent; URL appears suspicious and is explicitly external",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define a package setup. A custom install class is implemented that, during the run method, collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to an external domain with this data. The URL appears suspicious and potentially malicious. The request is sent automatically during package installation, which could be used for user tracking or information theft. No other malicious behaviors such as code injection or data exfiltration are present. The purpose seems to be data collection disguised as a setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious intent by exfiltrating system information during package installation to an external server. This behavior is suspicious and could compromise user privacy or be part of a malicious supply chain attack.",
