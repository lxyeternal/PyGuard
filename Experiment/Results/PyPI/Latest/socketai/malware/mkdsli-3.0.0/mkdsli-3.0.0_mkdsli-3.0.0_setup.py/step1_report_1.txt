{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup process that includes a custom installation step which sends system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The untrusted data (hostname, cwd, username) is sent via an HTTP GET request to 'http://o2zel35m.requestrepo.com' using requests.get().",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, username) → parameters of requests.get() → external server at o2zel35m.requestrepo.com.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a network request during the installation process that transmits potentially sensitive system information without user consent or transparency. The URL appears suspicious and possibly malicious, and the comment indicates replacing it with an alternative C2 or tracking service, suggesting potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard setuptools installation process by overriding the run() method. During installation, it collects system details and immediately sends them to an external server. This behavior is unusual for typical package setup scripts and can be used for system fingerprinting or malicious tracking. The URL used is suspicious, and the comment hints at potential malicious usage. No input validation or user notification is provided. The data collection and transmission occur silently during installation, which is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a malicious behavior pattern—collecting and transmitting system information during installation without user consent. The external request to a suspicious URL indicates an intent to fingerprint or track users covertly. Overall, this package demonstrates malicious behavior and should be considered high risk.",
