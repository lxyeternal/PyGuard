  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing an external binary without validation is inherently risky and aligns with behaviors seen in malicious scripts. While the script itself is not obfuscated or malicious, it serves as a potential delivery mechanism for malware if the binary is malicious. The overall security risk is high, and the malware potential is moderate to high depending on the binary's trustworthiness."
