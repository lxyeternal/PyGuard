  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate command dispatcher with potential operational risks due to external modules and destructive commands, but no inherent malicious code or obfuscation is present. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.2–0.3, considering external dependencies and destructive capabilities. The code is relatively safe but warrants caution regarding external modules and command usage."
