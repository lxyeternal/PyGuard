{
  "purpose": "A CLI tool that executes predefined server management scripts or functions based on user commands, including potentially destructive commands like 'nukeserver'.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for command selection; external modules ('pojang_resorter.forceop' and 'pojang_resorter.nukeserver') imported and invoked; subprocess calls to run scripts.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external scripts via subprocess; invocation of external modules' functions; potential execution of malicious or compromised code if external modules are malicious.",
  "flows": "User input -> command selection -> external module import or subprocess call -> execution of external scripts/functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to run scripts based on command-line input; dynamic import of external modules; execution of potentially destructive commands ('nukeserver') without additional validation.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a controlled CLI dispatcher for server management tasks, limiting commands to predefined options. It imports external modules for specific commands, which could be malicious if compromised, and executes scripts via subprocess. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The main security concern is trustworthiness of external modules and the potential misuse of destructive commands. The code itself is straightforward and does not contain malicious logic or obfuscation. External dependencies and destructive commands pose operational risks but do not constitute embedded malware.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate command dispatcher with potential operational risks due to external modules and destructive commands, but no inherent malicious code or obfuscation is present. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.2–0.3, considering external dependencies and destructive capabilities. The code is relatively safe but warrants caution regarding external modules and command usage.",
