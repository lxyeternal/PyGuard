{
  "purpose": "Provides basic package metadata and imports the main function for the CLI tool.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident as the code only sets metadata and imports a function.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports a 'main' function from a local module. It is a minimal, standard package initializer with no apparent security risks or malicious code. No input, output, or data processing occurs here. The structure suggests typical packaging practice without any obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a package initializer with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain any malicious code, data leakage points, or suspicious behavior.",
