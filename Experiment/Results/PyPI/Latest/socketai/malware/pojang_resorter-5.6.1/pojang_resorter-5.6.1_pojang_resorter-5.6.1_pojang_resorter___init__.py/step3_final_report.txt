  "purpose": "Package initialization and metadata definition for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Import of local module (.main), setting of __version__ and __author__ variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network activity, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statement from local module; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward package initializer that sets metadata and imports a local main function. No external data sources, sinks, or flows involving untrusted data are present. The code lacks obfuscation, dynamic execution, or network activity. All scores from the reports are consistent with this benign assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a very low security risk score (0 or 0.1). Given the simplicity and transparency, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is a standard package entry point with negligible security concerns.",
