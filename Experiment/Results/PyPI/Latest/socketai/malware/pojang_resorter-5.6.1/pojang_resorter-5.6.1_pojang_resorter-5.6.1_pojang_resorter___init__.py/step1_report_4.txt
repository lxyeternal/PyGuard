  "purpose": "Provides basic metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Imports from .main (local module), defines __version__ and __author__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a module docstring, an import statement, and two metadata variables (__version__ and __author__). There are no inputs, no data processing, and no external communications. The import is local and conventional for a Python package. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a typical package initialization or metadata file without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as part of a CLI tool package, providing metadata and importing the main functionality. Overall security risk is minimal.",
