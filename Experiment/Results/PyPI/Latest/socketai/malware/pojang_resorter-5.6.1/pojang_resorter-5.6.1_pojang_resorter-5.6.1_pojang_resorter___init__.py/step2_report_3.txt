  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal Python module that:\n- Contains package metadata (__version__, __author__).\n- Imports a 'main' function from a local module (.main).\n- Has no input/output, data processing, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n- Is typical for a package initializer or entry point.\n\n**Security and Maliciousness Assessment:**\n- No suspicious or obfuscated code.\n- No external data sources or sinks.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No signs of malware, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- The code's purpose is purely to set metadata and import a main function, which is standard practice.\n\n**Review of the Reports:**\n- All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, with confidence scores of 1.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, indicating no malicious behavior detected.\n- Security risk scores are also low (mostly 0, with one report at 0.1), which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Potential Issues or Inconsistencies:**\n- The only minor discrepancy is in report 5, which assigns a securityRisk of 0.1. Given the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious elements, this seems unjustified. The score should likely be 0, consistent with the other reports.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is safe and standard.\n- No evidence supports any malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, except for the minor securityRisk in report 5, which should be adjusted to 0.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, straightforward package initializer with no security concerns. The scores in the reports are consistent with this assessment, aside from the minor securityRisk in report 5, which should be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Based on the evidence, I recommend maintaining the scores at:\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- securityRisk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's simple, transparent nature.",
