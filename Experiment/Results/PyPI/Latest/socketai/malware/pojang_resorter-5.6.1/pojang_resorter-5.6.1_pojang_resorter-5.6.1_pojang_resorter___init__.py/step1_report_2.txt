{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module, defining __version__ and __author__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data flows involving untrusted data or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a package-level docstring, an import statement, and metadata definitions. There are no input sources, data processing, or external communications. The import statement imports from a local module, which does not raise suspicion. The metadata fields (__version__, __author__) are static strings providing package info. Overall, this is a straightforward module bootstrap with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that provides package metadata and imports a main function. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign component of a larger CLI package.",
