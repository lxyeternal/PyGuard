{
  "purpose": "Decode and execute a base64-encoded, zlib-compressed payload that is reversed before decoding.",
  "sources": "Input data is the string passed to the lambda function '__' which is the reversed version of the encoded payload.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decompressed and decoded code, which could execute arbitrary or malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Input string (__[::-1]) -> base64 decoding (__[::-1]) -> zlib decompression -> exec() on the decompressed code.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a non-standard obfuscation pattern: reversing the string before decoding and decompressing, which is unusual and often used to hide malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that takes an input string, reverses it, decodes from base64, then decompresses with zlib. The result is then executed via exec(). The input string appears to be a base64-encoded, compressed payload, reversed to evade detection. Since the payload is executed directly, it could contain any malicious code. This pattern is characteristic of obfuscated malicious scripts intended to conceal malicious behavior. No other library functions or external inputs are used; the entire malicious activity hinges on the decompression and execution of the payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to obfuscation and the use of exec() on decompressed, reversed payload data. It likely performs malicious actions, such as executing arbitrary code, which can include data theft, system modification, or network communication. Given the strong obfuscation and execution of decoded payload, it poses a significant security risk.",
