  "purpose": "Provide a CLI tool for displaying help and command options with ASCII art and colored formatting.",
  "sources": "argparse module for input parsing, colorama for terminal color output.",
  "sinks": "Print statements for displaying ASCII art and help information.",
  "flows": "User runs the script → show_help() function executes → ASCII art and command list are displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed. Usage of input parsing and printing libraries appears standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for terminal color output and defines a function to display help information with ASCII art. It uses argparse to set up command-line arguments with subcommands related to server management tasks. The ASCII art and command descriptions are printed to the console. No input is received from external sources at runtime that could influence behavior. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious actions are detected. The code does not perform network operations, file modifications, or data exfiltration. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward help display script with color formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help display script with ASCII art and color formatting. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected. It serves purely as a user interface component without any signs of malware or security risks.",
