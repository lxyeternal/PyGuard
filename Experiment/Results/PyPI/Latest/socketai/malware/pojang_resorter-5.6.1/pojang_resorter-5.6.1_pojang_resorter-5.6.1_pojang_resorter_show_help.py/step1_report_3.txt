{
  "purpose": "Provides a CLI tool with help and command descriptions for interacting with a Mojang-related system, displaying ASCII art and colored text.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse, reads console output for printing ASCII art and help information.",
  "sinks": "Outputs ASCII art, command help messages, and command descriptions; no data is sent or received over networks or stored.",
  "flows": "User input via command-line arguments influences which help information is displayed; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; ASCII art and command descriptions are benign. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a function to display ASCII art and command help, and sets up command-line argument parsing with subcommands. The ASCII art is static, and the help commands are straightforward. There are no network operations, data leaks, or security-sensitive operations. The code appears to be a benign CLI helper script with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple CLI help utility that displays ASCII art and command options, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as a user interface component.",
