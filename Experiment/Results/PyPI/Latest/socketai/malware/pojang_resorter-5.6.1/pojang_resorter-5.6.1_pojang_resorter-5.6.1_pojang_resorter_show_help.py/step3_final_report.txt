  "purpose": "Display ASCII art and command help descriptions for a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsed via argparse; static ASCII art and help text embedded in code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks; only outputs static help and ASCII art.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments determine which help message to display; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static CLI help utility that outputs ASCII art and command descriptions with colored formatting. It uses argparse for argument parsing and colorama for colored output. No dynamic data, external interactions, or malicious code are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions beyond printing static content. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and pose no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI help utility with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. Final scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
  "confidence": 1,
