{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface with help display, including ASCII art and colorized command descriptions.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine which subcommand to display/help for.",
  "sinks": "Uses print statements to display ASCII art and help information; no untrusted data is outputted or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed, then used solely to control help output; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors; the code only manages CLI help display with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama for colored output, defines a function to display ASCII art and help commands, and then executes this function in main. No input validation or external data handling occurs beyond argument parsing. All parts serve legitimate purposes related to CLI help display; no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI help display utility with ASCII art and colored output. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within the provided code segment.",
