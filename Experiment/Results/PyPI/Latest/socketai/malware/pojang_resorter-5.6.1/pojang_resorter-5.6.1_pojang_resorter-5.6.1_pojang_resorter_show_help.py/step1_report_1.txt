{
  "purpose": "The script provides a CLI tool that displays help information with ASCII art and colored command descriptions.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments through argparse to determine which subcommand to display help for.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data is used directly; the script only outputs static ASCII art, command descriptions, and colored text. No sinks such as network, file, or environment modifications are present.",
  "flows": "User inputs via command-line are processed but do not influence any sensitive actions or data flow; the code only displays static help information.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of colorama appears solely for aesthetic purposes; no dynamic or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports argparse for command-line parsing and colorama for colored output. It defines a function to display ASCII art and command descriptions, then calls it in the main block. All operations are static and solely for user guidance. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious actions are present. The code does not interact with external systems, files, or environment variables beyond standard imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI help utility with colorful ASCII art and command descriptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for user assistance.",
