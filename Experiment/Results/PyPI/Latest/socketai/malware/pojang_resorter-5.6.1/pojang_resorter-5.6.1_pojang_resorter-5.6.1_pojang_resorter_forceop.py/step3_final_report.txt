  "purpose": "Assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server via RCON.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments: username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'op {username}' command on the server, potential exposure of credentials if misused",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> assign_operator() -> MCRcon command('op {username}') -> server response",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward command execution",
  "analysis": "The code connects to a Minecraft server using provided credentials and issues an 'op' command to grant operator privileges. It uses standard libraries, handles exceptions, and logs activity. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The script's purpose is legitimate server administration. The security risk stems from privilege escalation if credentials are compromised, but the code itself does not introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the sensitive nature of privilege escalation but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate administrative tool with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. Its security risk is minimal and manageable with proper credential handling. Scores are consistent with the code's behavior, and no modifications are necessary.",
