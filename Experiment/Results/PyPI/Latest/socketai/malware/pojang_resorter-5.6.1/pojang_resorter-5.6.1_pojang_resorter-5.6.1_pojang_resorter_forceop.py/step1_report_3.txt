{
  "purpose": "The code assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server using RCON protocol.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line arguments: username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password.",
  "sinks": "The sink is the mcr.command() function which executes an RCON command that can affect the server state.",
  "flows": "User inputs are passed directly into the RCON command 'op {username}', leading to privilege escalation on the server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; standard logging practices; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script securely takes user input via command-line arguments and uses a reputable library (mcrcon) to send commands to the server. The only sensitive data used is the RCON password, which is supplied as an argument—this is expected behavior and not suspicious. The code includes error handling and logging, but no malicious or backdoor behaviors are evident. The command executed is straightforward: granting operator privileges, which is a legitimate server administration task. There are no signs of data leaks, code injection, or other malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate server administration function with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
