  "purpose": "This script assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server via RCON protocol.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from command-line arguments: username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password.",
  "sinks": "The script sends a command to the Minecraft server using the MCRcon library, which executes the 'op' command to grant privileges.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into the assign_operator function, which constructs and sends a command via the MCRcon connection to the server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated code; standard usage of a third-party library. No suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code captures user input via command-line arguments for username, server IP, port, and RCON password. It establishes an RCON connection to the server and issues an 'op' command to grant operator privileges. The code logs activities and handles exceptions properly. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The script relies entirely on external inputs to perform a legitimate administrative task, with no indication of malicious intent or dangerous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward administrative task without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. Overall, it appears safe with respect to supply chain security.",
