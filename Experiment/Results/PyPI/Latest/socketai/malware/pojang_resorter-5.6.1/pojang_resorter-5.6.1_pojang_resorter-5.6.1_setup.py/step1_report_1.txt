{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'pojang_resorter' Python package, including dependencies, package data, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependency specifications, and package data configurations.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted input or data is processed or output in a vulnerable manner.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is declarative setup configuration without data flow execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard setup tools and dependencies appears normal. Inclusion of an executable ('libs/windows.exe') in package data could be benign but warrants verification to ensure it is not malicious or harmful.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to configure a Python package, specifying dependencies such as 'requests', 'discord.py', 'gitpython', etc., which are common for various applications. The package data includes a Windows executable, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; further inspection of the executable is recommended. No code execution, data handling, or network activity occurs in this script. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present. Overall, this is a standard package setup script with a possibly unusual inclusion of an executable file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package. No malicious behavior or supply chain security risks are evident from this code alone. The inclusion of an executable warrants further review outside this script, but the script itself is benign.",
