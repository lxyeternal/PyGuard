  "purpose": "Locate 'pojangsetup.exe' in a 'libs' directory, create a shortcut in the Windows startup folder pointing to it, and execute the executable automatically.",
  "sources": "__file__ to determine script directory; environment variable 'APPDATA' for startup path; existence check for 'pojangsetup.exe' in 'libs' directory.",
  "sinks": "Creating a shortcut via COM automation ('WScript.Shell') in the startup folder; executing the executable via subprocess.Popen with shell=True.",
  "flows": "Script determines executable path -> creates shortcut in startup folder -> executes executable via subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'shell=True' in subprocess; no validation of executable's source or signature; automatic persistence setup without user consent; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code locates a specific executable, creates a startup shortcut, and runs the executable immediately. It employs standard Windows automation and subprocess calls. The main concern is the persistence mechanism and execution without validation, which could be exploited maliciously if the executable is untrusted. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. The use of 'shell=True' poses a potential security risk, but given the local paths, the immediate danger is limited. The behavior aligns with common persistence tactics used by malware, but the code itself is straightforward and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script facilitates persistence by adding a shortcut to the startup folder and executing an external executable without validation. While it does not contain malicious code, its behavior is suspicious and could be exploited if the executable is malicious. The malware score of 0.3 and risk score around 0.6 are appropriate, reflecting moderate suspicion primarily due to persistence mechanisms and execution behavior.",
