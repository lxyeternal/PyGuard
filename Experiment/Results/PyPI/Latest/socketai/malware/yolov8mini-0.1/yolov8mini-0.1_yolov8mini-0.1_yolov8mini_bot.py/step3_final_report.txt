  "purpose": "A Telegram bot providing remote system management functions including command execution, info retrieval, screenshots, WiFi passwords, and system control commands.",
  "sources": "Callback data triggering commands; subprocess.run calls executing system commands; reading system info and files.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands via subprocess; sending files and messages over Telegram; capturing sensitive info like WiFi passwords and user info.",
  "flows": "Callback data → subprocess.run (system commands) → output → Telegram messages or files; command triggers based on callback data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run with shell=True on callback data without validation; hardcoded bot token and user ID; no input sanitization; straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a powerful remote management tool capable of executing destructive commands, exfiltrating sensitive data, and controlling the system remotely. The use of subprocess with shell=True on callback data introduces potential command injection risks, though in this case the callback data is predefined. Hardcoded credentials pose security concerns. The code lacks obfuscation and hidden payloads but provides capabilities typical of malicious remote access trojans. The high potential for misuse and sensitive data access justifies elevated malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a highly invasive remote administration tool with capabilities that could be exploited maliciously. The absence of input validation, hardcoded credentials, and system control commands significantly elevate its threat level. Based on the analysis, the malware score should be set near 0.9, the obfuscation score remains 0, and the overall security risk is very high (~0.9). It should be treated as malicious or dangerous software in security assessments.",
