  "conclusion": "The code functions as a highly invasive remote administration tool with capabilities that could be exploited maliciously. The absence of input validation, hardcoded credentials, and system control commands significantly elevate its threat level. Based on the analysis, the malware score should be set near 0.9, the obfuscation score remains 0, and the overall security risk is very high (~0.9). It should be treated as malicious or dangerous software in security assessments."
