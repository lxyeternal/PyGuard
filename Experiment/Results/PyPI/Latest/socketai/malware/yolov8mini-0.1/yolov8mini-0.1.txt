      "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The only potential concern is the execution of 'run_bot', which could contain malicious code, but this cannot be determined from the setup script alone. Therefore, the malware score remains 0, obfuscation is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), justified by the possibility of malicious code in the invoked function. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution and obfuscation, leading to a moderate malware and security risk score. However, without concrete malicious payloads, the overall threat remains moderate. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the described patterns."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a highly invasive remote administration tool with capabilities that could be exploited maliciously. The absence of input validation, hardcoded credentials, and system control commands significantly elevate its threat level. Based on the analysis, the malware score should be set near 0.9, the obfuscation score remains 0, and the overall security risk is very high (~0.9). It should be treated as malicious or dangerous software in security assessments."
