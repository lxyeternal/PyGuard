  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potentially suspicious code patterns such as eval/exec, hardcoded URLs, obfuscation, external communication, environment variable usage.",
  "sinks": "Network requests, file writes, subprocess calls, environment variables, external API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (e.g., environment variables, external URLs) to sinks (network, file, subprocess), possibly via dynamic code execution or obfuscated code segments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, hardcoded URLs, obfuscation, complex or confusing code structure, dynamic execution, suspicious external endpoints.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as eval/exec, hardcoded URLs, and obfuscation, indicating potential malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The suspicion is moderate, with a malware score of 0.3, justified by these patterns but lacking confirmed malicious payloads. The obfuscation score of 0.4 aligns with the described code complexity. The security risk score of 0.55 reflects the moderate concern due to suspicious patterns. Other reports show benign code with no suspicious patterns, consistent with their low scores. Overall, the analysis suggests the code warrants cautious review, especially in Report 1, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution and obfuscation, leading to a moderate malware and security risk score. However, without concrete malicious payloads, the overall threat remains moderate. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the described patterns.",
