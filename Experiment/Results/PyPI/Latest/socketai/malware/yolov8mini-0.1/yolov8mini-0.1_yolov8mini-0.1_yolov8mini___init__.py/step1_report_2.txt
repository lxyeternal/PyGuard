  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific functionality, but the exact intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from environment variables, file I/O, and possibly network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, subprocess executions, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input files to sinks like network sockets, files, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Unusual dynamic code execution or misleading variable names are not apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for suspicious patterns, including data leaks, insecure operations, and malicious payloads. No malicious behavior, such as unauthorized data transmission, reverse shells, or cryptomining activity, was detected. Usage of third-party libraries is standard, and no obfuscated or suspicious code constructs were identified. The code performs expected operations without signs of sabotage or malicious intent. Due to lack of explicit malicious indicators, confidence in benign assessment is high, though thorough review of any external inputs and context-specific behavior could improve certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the detailed review, the code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It appears to be a standard functional script with no dangerous or malicious constructs identified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
