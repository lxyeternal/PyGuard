{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'yolov8mini', specifying dependencies, entry points, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads the README.md file for long description and gathers package information with find_packages(). No input from untrusted sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems; the script does not perform data processing or network communication.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the setup process is static, configuring package installation parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is a standard setup script without unusual language features, obfuscation, or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is a conventional setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It uses setuptools to specify package details, dependencies, and entry points. It reads a local README.md file for description and does not execute any suspicious or dynamic code. No hardcoded credentials, external data fetching, or code execution beyond standard package setup are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
