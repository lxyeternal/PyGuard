  "purpose": "Assigns operator privileges to a specified username through command-line input.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'username' argument from the command line via argparse.",
  "sinks": "Prints confirmation or error messages to stdout; no direct data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input from command line (source) flows through assign_operator() and results in print output (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts a username via command-line argument, then outputs a message confirming assignment of operator privileges. There are no external data transmissions, no sensitive data handling beyond printing, and no insecure operations. The code structure is simple and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic privilege assignment notification through command-line input. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or anomalous behavior. It appears to be a benign utility script.",
