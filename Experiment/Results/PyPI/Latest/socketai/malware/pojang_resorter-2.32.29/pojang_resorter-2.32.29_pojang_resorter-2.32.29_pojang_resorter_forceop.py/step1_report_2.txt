  "purpose": "Assign operator privileges to a specified user via command-line input.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument 'username' obtained through argparse.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs a message indicating privileges assignment.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line argument 'username' flows into the assign_operator function, which then outputs a message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script parses a username from command-line arguments and prints a message indicating operator privileges assignment. No external data sources, network activity, or file operations are present. The logic is simple and does not perform any malicious actions. There is no use of insecure functions, no data leaks, and no obfuscated code. The purpose appears to be administrative, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed solely for assigning privileges via command-line. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
