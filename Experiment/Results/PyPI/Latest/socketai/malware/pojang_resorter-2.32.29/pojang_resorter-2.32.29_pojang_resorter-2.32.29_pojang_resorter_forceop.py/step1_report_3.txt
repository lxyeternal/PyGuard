  "sources": "Command-line argument 'username' parsed through argparse.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs information about privilege assignment.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (username) -> assign_operator() -> print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code simply prints a message based on input.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to assign operator privileges by printing a message. It uses argparse to accept a username as a command-line argument. The logic is straightforward and only outputs a message. There are no hidden or suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, no data exfiltration, or unsafe operations. The code does not perform any network operations, modify system files, or execute untrusted code. It is a basic input-output script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple utility for assigning operator privileges by printing a message based on provided input. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears benign and straightforward.",
