  "purpose": "The code assigns operator privileges to a specified user via command-line input.",
  "sources": "User input from command-line argument 'username'.",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output confirmation messages; no direct data leaks or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "User inputs 'username' -> assign_operator function -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses argparse to receive a username argument. It then calls assign_operator to output a confirmation message. The code is straightforward, with no external data fetching, no sensitive data handling, and no insecure operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data transmission. The code performs a simple user privilege assignment notification via print statement, which is typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple command-line operation without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks.",
