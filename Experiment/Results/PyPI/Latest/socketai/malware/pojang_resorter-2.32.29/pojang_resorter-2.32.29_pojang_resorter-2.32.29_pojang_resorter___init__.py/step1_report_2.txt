  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code only imports a module and sets metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of package metadata and an import statement from a local module. There are no data inputs, network connections, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be standard package initialization code with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a package metadata file with a simple import. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
