  "purpose": "Minimal package initializer importing main from local module and setting metadata.",
  "sources": "Import from .main module, setting __version__ and __author__ variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statement and variable assignments; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python package setup file, importing a local main function and defining metadata. It contains no input handling, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated constructs. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. The confidence levels are high, reflecting the code's simplicity. No signs of malicious intent, suspicious data flows, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initializer with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
