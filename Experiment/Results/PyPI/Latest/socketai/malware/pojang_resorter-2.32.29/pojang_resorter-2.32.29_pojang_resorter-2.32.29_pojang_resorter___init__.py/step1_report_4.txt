  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool",
  "sources": "Imports main from a local module (.main)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no input processing or external data handling observed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious constructs; only metadata and a simple import",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports a main function from a local module. There are no inputs, no external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The import is from a relative module, which is standard in Python packages. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code. Overall, this is a minimal, benign package descriptor with an import statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization file with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply sets metadata and imports a main function, typical for Python packages.",
