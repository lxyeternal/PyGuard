  "purpose": "Provide functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Importing 'main' from the local module '.main'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks; the code mainly imports and defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of actual logic, no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures. The package appears minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a main function from a local module, sets version and author metadata, and contains no further logic or data handling. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious behaviors. It is a simple package entry point with no external network activity or sensitive data operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module initializer with no malicious intent or security risks evident from this fragment.",
