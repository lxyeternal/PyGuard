  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or outputs",
  "flows": "Import from .main module (potentially where actual functionality resides)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and primarily metadata and import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a simple docstring describing the package, an import statement from a local module, and metadata variables for version and author. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations present. Without the content of the imported 'main' module, the code appears benign. No suspicious or malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a basic package initializer with metadata and a single import statement. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. It appears safe and standard for a Python package.",
