  "conclusion": "The setup code itself appears benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary concern is the included 'libs/windows.exe', which should be inspected separately. Based on this configuration alone, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3). Further analysis of the executable is recommended to confirm its safety."
