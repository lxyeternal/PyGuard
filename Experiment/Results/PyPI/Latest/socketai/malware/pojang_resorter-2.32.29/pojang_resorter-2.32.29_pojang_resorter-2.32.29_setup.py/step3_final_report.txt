{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'pojang_resorter' Python package, defining dependencies, entry points, and package data.",
  "sources": "Dependencies listed in 'install_requires'; package data including 'libs/windows.exe'. No runtime code or data input/output shown.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; potential concern is the included 'libs/windows.exe' which could be executed or inspected externally.",
  "flows": "No runtime flows; the setup script does not execute code beyond package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe' as package data is unusual; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The setup script is standard and benign in structure. The main anomaly is the embedded Windows executable, which warrants further inspection outside this script. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in the configuration. Dependencies are common and do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), reflecting caution due to the executable's presence. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.8), given the straightforward nature of the script and the lack of suspicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup code itself appears benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary concern is the included 'libs/windows.exe', which should be inspected separately. Based on this configuration alone, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3). Further analysis of the executable is recommended to confirm its safety.",
