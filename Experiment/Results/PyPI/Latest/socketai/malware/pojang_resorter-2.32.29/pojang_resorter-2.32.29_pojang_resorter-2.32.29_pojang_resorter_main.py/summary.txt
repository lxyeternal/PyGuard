  "conclusion": "The code itself is a benign command dispatcher but presents security risks due to reliance on external scripts and the presence of a potentially destructive command 'nukeserver'. Proper validation, access controls, and sandboxing are recommended to mitigate risks. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.6."
