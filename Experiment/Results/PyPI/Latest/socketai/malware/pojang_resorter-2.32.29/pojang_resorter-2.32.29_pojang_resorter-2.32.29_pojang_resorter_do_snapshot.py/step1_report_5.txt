{
  "purpose": "Decompresses and executes a base64-encoded, reversed, zlib-compressed payload.",
  "sources": "Input data is embedded as a base64-encoded string in the code, which is then reversed and decoded.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decompressed and decoded code via exec().",
  "flows": "The code takes the embedded payload, reverses it, base64 decodes, decompresses, and then executes it.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda to perform decompression and decoding; obfuscated data manipulation; immediate execution of decompressed code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that imports zlib to decompress and base64 to decode data. It reverses the embedded payload string, decodes and decompresses it, then executes the resulting code directly with exec(). This obfuscation technique is typical of malicious code to hide payloads. The embedded payload appears to be intentionally obfuscated and likely contains malicious behavior, such as payload execution, potential data exfiltration, or system compromise. The code uses no external inputs or parameters, indicating that it runs a preset payload, not dynamically loaded data. The structure and technique used suggest an intent to conceal malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to obfuscation, use of dynamic execution, and the pattern of decoding, decompressing, and executing embedded data. This pattern is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to hide their true payload. It likely executes malicious code upon running, representing a significant security risk.",
