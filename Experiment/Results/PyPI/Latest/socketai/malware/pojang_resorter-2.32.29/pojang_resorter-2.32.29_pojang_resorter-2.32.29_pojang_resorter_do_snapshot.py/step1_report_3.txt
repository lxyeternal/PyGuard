  "purpose": "Decodes and executes a base64-encoded, reversed, compressed payload.",
  "sources": "Input data is the string passed to the lambda function which is reversed and then decoded from base64, then decompressed.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decompressed code via exec().",
  "flows": "Input string -> reversed -> base64 decode -> zlib decompress -> exec()",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically constructs a payload, manipulates encoding and compression, and then executes it, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a lambda function that decompresses data after reversing and decoding. The payload appears to be heavily obfuscated, involving base64 decoding, string reversal, and zlib decompression, which are common anti-analysis techniques. The final step is executing the decompressed code via exec(), which is a high-risk behavior. The payload data is large and looks random, consistent with obfuscation or encrypted data. This pattern suggests the code is designed to hide malicious payloads or behavior, typical of malware or malicious supply chain components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious, employing multiple obfuscation layers and executing dynamically decompressed code. These are common traits of malicious modules intended to conceal harmful activities, such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoor installation. Given the pattern and obfuscation, the overall risk is high.",
