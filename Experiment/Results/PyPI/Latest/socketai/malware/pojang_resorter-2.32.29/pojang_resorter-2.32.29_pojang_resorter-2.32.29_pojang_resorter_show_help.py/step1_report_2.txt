{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface with help information and ASCII art for a Python-Mojang interaction tool.",
  "sources": "argparse module for command-line argument parsing, colorama module for colored terminal output.",
  "sinks": "print statements outputting ASCII art and help text, which do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; input data is only used for command parsing and display purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward CLI help display.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama, defines a help display function that prints ASCII art with colors, sets up argument parsing with subcommands, and displays help information. No input validation, no external data processing, and no dynamic code execution. All operations are static and intended for user help output.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving solely as a CLI help utility with colorful ASCII art. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
