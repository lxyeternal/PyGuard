{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface with ASCII art and colored command descriptions for a Python-Mojang interaction tool.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments using argparse to determine user commands.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or used in a way that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed but not used beyond displaying help information; no flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code is straightforward and intended for user interface purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a function to display help with ASCII art and command descriptions, and prints this help when executed. It uses argparse to define several subcommands, but these are only for help display; no execution logic or data processing occurs beyond argument parsing. The code does not read external input beyond command-line arguments, nor does it perform network operations, data access, or system modifications. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI help display script with no malicious intent, no data leaks, and no security risks. It solely outputs ASCII art and command descriptions for user guidance.",
