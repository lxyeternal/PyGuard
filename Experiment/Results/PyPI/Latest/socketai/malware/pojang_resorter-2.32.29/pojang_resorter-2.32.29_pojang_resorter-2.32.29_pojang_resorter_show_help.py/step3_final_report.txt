  "purpose": "Display ASCII art and command help information with colored formatting in a CLI environment.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsing; static ASCII art and help text.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "User invokes the script -> show_help() executes -> ASCII art and help info are printed.",
  "anomalies": "None; static content, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a show_help() function that prints static ASCII art and command descriptions, and uses argparse to set up subcommands which are only for help display. It does not process untrusted input or perform any network or data operations. All reports correctly identify the script as a benign CLI help utility with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's behavior. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, static, and purely for display purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, static CLI help display with ASCII art and colored command descriptions. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
