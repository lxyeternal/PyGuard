      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The setup code itself appears benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary concern is the included 'libs/windows.exe', which should be inspected separately. Based on this configuration alone, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3). Further analysis of the executable is recommended to confirm its safety."

The current scores are accurate but can be refined by setting the security risk score to 0, reflecting its harmless nature."

All reports correctly identify these risks, and the scoring aligns with the pattern. It should be treated as malicious with maximum caution."

      "conclusion": "The code is straightforward but incomplete and potentially obfuscated. It executes an external binary without validation, posing a security risk if the binary is malicious. The missing import indicates incomplete code or obfuscation. Overall, it should be treated as a moderate security risk due to external code execution without validation."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious due to its heavy obfuscation and dynamic code execution pattern. The high scores across reports are justified. It should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious, and further dynamic or static analysis of the decompressed payload is recommended before any execution."

      "conclusion": "The code itself is a benign command dispatcher but presents security risks due to reliance on external scripts and the presence of a potentially destructive command 'nukeserver'. Proper validation, access controls, and sandboxing are recommended to mitigate risks. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.6."
