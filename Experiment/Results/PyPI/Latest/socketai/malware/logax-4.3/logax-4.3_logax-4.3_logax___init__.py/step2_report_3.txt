  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- The code performs a relative import of all symbols from the local module `info`.\n- It is a common pattern in Python, though using `import *` is discouraged due to namespace pollution.\n- There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks in this snippet alone.\n- Without additional context, it’s impossible to determine if the imported module `info` contains malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that this is a straightforward import with no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `confidence=1`.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the potential issue with `import *` but no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0.9`, `confidence=0.9`.\n\n**Comment:** The high obfuscation score might be slightly overstated; `import *` can obscure symbols but isn't inherently malicious or obfuscated. I suggest lowering `obfuscated` to 0.3–0.4, and `securityRisk` remains 0 as no risk is evident.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0.1`, `obfuscated=0`, `confidence=0.9`.\n\n**Comment:** The `securityRisk=0.1` seems a bit high for such a benign import. Possibly, the risk score should be 0 unless further context suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `confidence=1`.\n\nNo issues here.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `confidence=0.8`.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scoring:\n- All reports correctly identify that this code snippet alone does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n- The `malware` score should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- The `obfuscated` score in report 2 might be slightly high; I recommend lowering it.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are generally low; only report 3 has a marginally higher value, which I suggest reducing.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports; no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be around 0.2–0.4 for report 2, given the use of `import *` can obscure symbols but is not malicious.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain very low (around 0.0–0.1), as the snippet is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **My recommended scores:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | SecurityRisk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0.2          | 0.0          |\n| 2       | 0       | 0.3          | 0.0          |\n| 3       | 0       | 0.2          | 0.0          |\n| 4       | 0       | 0.2          | 0.0          |\n| 5       | 0       | 0.2          | 0.0          |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- The import statement is benign.\n- No evidence supports higher malware or security risk scores.\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged but not malicious.\n- Overall, the reports are reasonable, with minor adjustments suggested for the obfuscation scores.\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the context of the imported module; if `info` contains malicious code, that would change the assessment, but based solely on this import line, the risk remains negligible.",
