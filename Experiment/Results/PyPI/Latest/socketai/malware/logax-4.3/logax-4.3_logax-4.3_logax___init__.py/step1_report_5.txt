  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the local module 'info'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package/module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows observed in this line.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident from this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can be considered bad practice but is not inherently malicious. No suspicious or unusual behavior detected in this minimal code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement that imports everything from a local module named 'info'. There is no data processing, no untrusted input handling, and no apparent malicious or suspicious behavior. The absence of additional code limits the ability to identify any malicious intent or security issues. Given the minimal context, this is a standard import statement, although the use of '*' can sometimes hide imported content or lead to maintenance issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. It is a common pattern in Python, albeit discouraged in some cases due to namespace pollution, but it does not pose a security threat.",
