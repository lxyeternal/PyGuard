  "purpose": "Import all definitions and functions from the local module 'info'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement from a local module file 'info'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are explicitly present in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are observable from the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no additional context; it does not include any suspicious or unusual code. The use of a wildcard import ('*') can be considered bad practice but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of an import statement that brings in all elements from a local module named 'info'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities. Without additional context or code, this snippet alone cannot be assessed as malicious. The use of 'from .info import *' could potentially mask what is being imported but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement and does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. It is a common practice in Python modules, though using wildcard imports is discouraged for clarity. No malware or security concerns are evident here.",
