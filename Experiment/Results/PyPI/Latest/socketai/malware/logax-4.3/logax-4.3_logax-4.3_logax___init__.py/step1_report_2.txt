{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module 'info' within the same package, likely to access functions, classes, or variables defined there for further use.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the 'info' module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling is present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The import statement potentially introduces all exported symbols from 'info' into the current namespace, but no runtime data flow or processing is shown here.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .info import *' can obscure the actual imported symbols, making code harder to audit; however, this alone is not malicious. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple import statement using relative import syntax. It imports all symbols from a module named 'info' in the same package. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks within this single line. Without additional context, it is a standard import and does not indicate malicious intent. The only concern might be the use of 'import *', which can hide imported symbols and make code harder to analyze but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior. It does not exhibit any malware activity, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a common pattern used to import all contents from a module.",
