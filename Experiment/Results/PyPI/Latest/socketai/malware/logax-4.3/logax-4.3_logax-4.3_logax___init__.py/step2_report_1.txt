  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports concern the same code: `from .info import *`.\n- The code is a standard relative import of all symbols from a local module `info`.\n- No additional code, data flows, or suspicious patterns are provided.\n- The reports consistently conclude that this is benign, standard practice, with some noting that `import *` is discouraged but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Is the reported code present?**  \n  Yes, all reports are about the same line: `from .info import *`. Confirmed.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' logic?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that this is a straightforward import statement. They also correctly note that `import *` can obscure imported symbols but is not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Specific issues and scoring:\n\n#### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- All reports assign malware = 0, which is appropriate given the code snippet.\n- Obfuscated = 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation evident.\n\n#### Security Risk:\n- The reports assign a security risk score mostly at 0 or 0.1, citing that wildcard imports can be bad practice but not malicious.\n- Given only this line, **no actual security risk** exists, as no data is being processed or transmitted.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes, they align with the analysis. No report suggests any malicious activity or significant security concern.\n\n- **Are any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports correctly state that, without additional context, this is a benign import statement.\n\n- **Are the risk scores justified?**  \n  Since there's no malicious activity, malware, or security risk, a score of 0 or very close to 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to it, e.g., 0.1 at most, but the reports already reflect that)\n\n**Note:** The only potential concern with such code is the use of `import *`, which can hide imported symbols and cause namespace pollution, but it does not pose a security threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Justified Score | Reasoning                                              |\n|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                       | No malicious activity present.                         |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                       | No obfuscation detected.                               |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1 (max)               | Minor concern about code clarity, not security.      |\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n- The code snippet is benign.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments provided.**",
