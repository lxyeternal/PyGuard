  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .info import *`.\n- They uniformly conclude that this is a standard import statement with no malicious intent.\n- The only noted concern is the use of `import *`, which is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- No reports indicate actual code execution, data flow, or suspicious behavior beyond the import statement itself.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- **Issue presence:** No. The code is a simple relative import; no issues or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected. No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis.\n- They correctly identify that the import statement alone does not pose a security risk.\n- They mention that `import *` can obscure what is imported, which is good practice advice but not an actual security concern.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: mostly 0, with a minor 0.1 in one report (Report 3). This seems reasonable given the context.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), which is appropriate for such straightforward code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there's no evidence of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation, the overall risk should remain very low.\n- The minor securityRisk score of 0.1 in one report is acceptable, possibly reflecting the general caution about wildcard imports, but it doesn't indicate actual risk.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all assessments are based on the code snippet.\n- No claims of potential vulnerabilities are overstated.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minor, due to the use of `import *`, but not a real security concern.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard relative import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The minor concern about `import *` is acknowledged but does not elevate the risk score meaningfully. The existing reports are accurate and reasonable.",
