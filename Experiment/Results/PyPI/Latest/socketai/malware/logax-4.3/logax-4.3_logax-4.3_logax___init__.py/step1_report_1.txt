{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols and definitions from the local 'info' module, likely for use within the current module or script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module '.info', which is a relative import within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks or data output points; this line only performs an import operation.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling occurs in this line; it only loads code from a local module.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'from .info import *' can obscure what is imported, but this is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a standard relative import of all contents from the 'info' module in the same package. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior in this import statement alone. As it is a simple import, it does not introduce security risks or malicious activity by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard practice in Python packages and does not pose a threat.",
