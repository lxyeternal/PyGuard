{
  "purpose": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from the local module 'info'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no additional data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are involved in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The import brings symbols into the namespace; no data flow or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure imported symbols and cause namespace pollution, but this is a style issue, not a security concern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks are evident. The use of 'import *' is discouraged for clarity but does not introduce security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very close) are appropriate given the snippet. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities solely from this line.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no malicious or security risks. The minor concern about 'import *' is a style issue, not a security threat. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
