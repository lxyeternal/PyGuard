  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code: `from .info import *`.\n- The code is a relative import of all symbols from a local module `info`.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation is present.\n- The main concern noted is the use of `import *`, which can obscure imported symbols and hinder code clarity, but this is a coding style issue, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correctly states the import purpose.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard import.\n- **Conclusion:** No threat.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, `confidence: 1`.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent; the concern is about `import *`.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard practice, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, `confidence: 0.9`.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The slight reduction in confidence is reasonable given the ambiguity of `import *`.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; use of wildcard import is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0.1`, `obfuscated: 0`, `confidence: 0.9`.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher `securityRisk` (0.1) due to the wildcard import, which can sometimes cause maintenance issues or namespace pollution. Still, not a security threat.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** No data flow or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard import.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, `confidence: 1`.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; use of `import *` is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No threat.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, `confidence: 0.8`.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign `0`. The code is a simple import statement with no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are `0`, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly higher (`0.1`) in one report due to the use of `import *`, which can cause namespace pollution but does not directly introduce security risks.\n- **Confidence levels:** High, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation present.\n- **Security risk score:** **0.1** — justified due to the use of `import *`, which can cause maintenance issues but not security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional comments:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The only potential concern is the use of `import *`, which is a style issue rather than a security issue.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or malicious code in the provided snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Final verdict:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\nThis assessment aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code snippet.",
