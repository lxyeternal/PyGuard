  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The import of `*` from `.info` is standard, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that this is a simple relative import, with no security risks or malware indications.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that `from .info import *` is standard but can obscure imported symbols.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that this is a common pattern, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly less (0.9) but still reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard import statement, with acknowledgment that `*` import is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly assesses that there's no malicious activity, data leakage, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — the risk score is very low, which is acceptable given the minimal context.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the import is straightforward and does not involve data processing or network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, with mention that `*` import can be bad practice but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — suitable.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower (0.8), but still acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports accurately identify that the code is a simple relative import of all symbols from `.info`.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are zero, which aligns with the actual code snippet.\n- **Security risk:** All are at or near zero, which is appropriate given the context.\n- **Potential issues:** The only common concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide imported symbols and complicate security audits, but this is not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Remains at 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower in some reports due to lack of context, but overall justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.05 — minimal risk, mainly due to the use of `import *`, which is a style concern but not a security threat.\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code snippet in question is benign and does not pose security risks or malware concerns.",
