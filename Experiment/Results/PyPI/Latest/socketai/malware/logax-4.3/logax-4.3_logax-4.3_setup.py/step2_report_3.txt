  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code performs standard setup tasks without suspicious behavior.\n- No anomalies, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also confirms standard setup behavior, reading README, defining dependencies, no suspicious code.\n- Author fields are empty but not malicious.\n- Malware score: 0 — consistent.\n- Risk score: 0 — consistent.\n- Confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly less confident (0.9), mentions potential concern about dependencies or URLs, but finds them legitimate.\n- No suspicious behavior detected.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Confidence: 0.9 — acceptable given the cautious tone.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to others, confirms standard setup process, no anomalies.\n- No suspicious elements.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also confirms benign, standard setup script.\n- No anomalies, no suspicious code.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Justification:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is correct given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no security risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code and analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The overall assessment is that this code is a typical, benign setup script with no security concerns.\n\n### Personal estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews provided.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
