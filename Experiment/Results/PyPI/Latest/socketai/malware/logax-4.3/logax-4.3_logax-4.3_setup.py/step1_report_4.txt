  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the Python library 'logax'.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, and package metadata definitions within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no code executes untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> assign to 'long_description' -> pass parameters to setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The author and author_email fields are empty but not malicious. No dynamic execution or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to configure packaging for a Python library. It reads a markdown file for long description, specifies metadata, dependencies, and package info. There are no code injection points, no external data execution, and no suspicious logic. All dependencies are common packages, and no hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are present. The script appears typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
