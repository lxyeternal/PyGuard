  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound, and the analysis correctly identifies the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The setup script is typical and benign.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None. The report correctly notes the lack of anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code remains a straightforward setup script.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The report appropriately dismisses potential concerns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's evaluation is correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is standard.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None. The analysis is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a typical setup script.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None. The reasoning is correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 fit the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' evaluations are consistent and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
