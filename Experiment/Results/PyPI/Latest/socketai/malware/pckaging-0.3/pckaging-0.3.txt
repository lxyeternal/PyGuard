      "conclusion": "The package code performs automatic, privacy-invasive data exfiltration during installation, which is highly suspicious and should be flagged as malicious. The current scores are generally appropriate, but the malware score in report 3 should be increased from 0.4 to around 0.8 to better represent the severity of the privacy violation. The behavior warrants high concern and caution in security assessments."
