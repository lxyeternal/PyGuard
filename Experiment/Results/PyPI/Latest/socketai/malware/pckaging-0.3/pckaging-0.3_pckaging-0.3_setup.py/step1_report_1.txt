{
  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package with a custom post-installation step that reports system information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs ('https://api.ipify.org' and the webhook URL) and system information retrieved via platform module.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to a constructed URL containing system hostname, OS, and IP address, which could leak user data.",
  "flows": "System information (hostname, OS, IP) is fetched and concatenated into a URL, then sent via an HTTP GET request to an external webhook, potentially exposing user data.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes the automatic transmission of system hostname, OS, and IP address to a third-party URL during package installation without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package installation. During installation, it runs a custom command that invokes the 'send' function. The 'send' function retrieves system hostname and OS info via 'platform' module and IP address via 'requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')'. It then constructs a URL with this data and sends an HTTP GET request to a webhook URL. This behavior could be used to exfiltrate system information without explicit user approval, constituting a privacy violation. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code execution are present. The code relies on external network requests to transfer data. The overall structure is straightforward, but the automatic data transmission is suspicious in the context of package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a potentially malicious action by collecting and exfiltrating system information during installation without user consent. This behavior indicates privacy invasion rather than benign setup operations.",
