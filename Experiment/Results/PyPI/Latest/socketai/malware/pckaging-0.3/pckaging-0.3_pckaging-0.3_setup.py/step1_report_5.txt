{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a post-install hook to perform additional actions after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information via platform.node() and platform.system(), and makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs, including a webhook URL and an IP address service.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to a webhook URL constructed with system information and IP address, potentially leaking system data.",
  "flows": "During installation, the send() function is called, which collects system hostname, OS name, and external IP address, then sends this data via a GET request to a webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system and network information to an external webhook during installation, which is not standard practice for package setup scripts. The code does not validate or sanitize data before transmission.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup operations but includes a malicious-like post-install step that collects system hostname, OS, and external IP address, then transmits this data to a third-party webhook URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration without user consent. The code uses external requests during installation, which is suspicious. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads, but the data collection and transmission are privacy violations and potential security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious-like behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation to an external webhook, which could be used for tracking or malicious monitoring. This is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious behavior.",
