  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a post-installation step.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs (webhook and IP service), reading platform information (platform.node() and platform.system()).",
  "sinks": "Sending data to a webhook URL containing system hostname, OS info, and external IP address.",
  "flows": "After installation, the send() function is invoked, which constructs a URL with system info and IP, then performs an HTTP GET request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code gathers system hostname, OS info, and external IP address without any user consent or indication. It sends this data automatically upon package installation, which is unusual behavior for a typical setup script. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating potential data exfiltration. The code executes a network request during installation without user awareness.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks using setuptools, but it contains a hidden malicious activity: the send() function collects system hostname, OS type, and public IP address, then sends this information to an external webhook URL immediately after installation. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, which is suspicious. The code's structure is straightforward; there is no obfuscation or complex logic. The external requests are direct and unprotected, and the URL is hardcoded, indicating malicious intent. No other security issues like injection or code execution vulnerabilities are present, but the privacy violation is significant.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external webhook during package installation. This suggests malicious intent, such as spying or data theft, making the package potentially dangerous for end users. It is strongly recommended not to use this package.",
