{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process with a custom post-installation step that sends system information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information using platform.node() and platform.system(), and fetches the public IP address via requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL with system info is used in requests.get(), which sends data to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Source: platform.node() and platform.system() + requests.get('https://api.ipify.org') -> Sink: requests.get() call to the webhook URL with embedded system info.",
  "anomalies": "The post-install step automatically transmits system details without user consent, and the URL used for data exfiltration is hardcoded with a unique webhook endpoint. No validation or obfuscation present. The code executes network requests during installation, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code installs a package and performs a network request during the installation process. It collects system hostname, OS name, and public IP address, then sends this data to a predefined external webhook URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking, especially as it occurs automatically upon installation. No clear user permission prompts or safeguards are present. The URL indicates a webhook service, commonly used for malicious or tracking purposes. While the code does not contain obfuscated or malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration, this pattern is suspicious and could be used for malicious tracking or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The package performs an automatic data exfiltration of system information during installation by sending it to an external webhook. This behavior is suspicious and could be malicious or privacy-invading, violating typical package expectations. No malicious code like backdoors or system damage is present, but the exfiltration pattern warrants caution.",
