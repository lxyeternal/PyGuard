{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script with a custom post-installation hook.",
  "sources": "The code reads platform node name and system info, and performs HTTP GET requests to external URLs during installation.",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL with system info and IP address is used in a GET request, potentially transmitting system data to an external server.",
  "flows": "During installation, the `send()` function executes, sending system hostname, OS info, and IP address to a remote webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an automatic network request to an external URL during installation, transmitting system details without user consent. No authentication or user prompts are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package installation. The custom 'PostInstallCommand' executes the 'send()' function post-install. The 'send()' function constructs a URL containing the system's hostname, OS name, and external IP address retrieved via requests. It then sends a GET request to this URL, which appears to be a webhook endpoint. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of system info during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The code does not verify or authenticate the request, nor does it inform the user, suggesting malicious intent or privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes code that automatically collects and transmits system hostname, OS, and IP address data during installation without user knowledge or consent. This behavior is suspicious and could be used for malicious tracking or data exfiltration. Overall, the code demonstrates malicious privacy violations.",
