{
  "purpose": "Utility functions to retrieve the timestamp of the latest or specific blockchain blocks using Web3.",
  "sources": "Reads from Web3.eth.get_block() which fetches blockchain data; no direct user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that lead to data leaks or external systems; primarily processes blockchain data internally.",
  "flows": "Calls get_block, processes 'timestamp' field, converts and returns datetime object; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The functions include a warning not to use in production, but this is just documentation, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for retrieving block timestamps, handling both string and integer formats depending on middleware. The only noteworthy aspect is the comment warning 'Do not use', which suggests the function may be intended for testing or internal purposes. There is no malicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behavior present. The use of external library 'web3' is standard for blockchain interactions. No suspicious data flow or obfuscation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for blockchain timestamp retrieval with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The warning comment does not indicate malicious intent, just caution about usage context.",
