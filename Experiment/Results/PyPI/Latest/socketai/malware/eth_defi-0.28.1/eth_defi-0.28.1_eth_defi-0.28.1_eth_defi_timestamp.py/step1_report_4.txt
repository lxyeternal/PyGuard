  "purpose": "Utility functions to retrieve Ethereum block timestamps using web3.py",
  "sources": "web3.eth.get_block calls, reading 'timestamp' from block data",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is sent to external systems or stored insecurely",
  "flows": "Input web3 object and block identifier → web3.eth.get_block → extract 'timestamp' → convert and return datetime",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code structures, no obfuscated code, no malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard web3.py methods to fetch block data and extract timestamps. It includes a comment warning not to use the function, but this is a normal developer note, not malicious. The timestamp handling accounts for string and integer types, with a conversion utility, which appears straightforward. No external data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious intent are present. The functions do not perform any network operations beyond calling web3 methods, nor do they process or leak data insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility functions for blockchain data retrieval with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
