  "sources": "web3.eth.get_block, convert_jsonrpc_value_to_int",
  "sinks": "datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp",
  "flows": "get_block retrieves block data -> timestamp extracted -> converted to int if needed -> returned as datetime",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns, no dynamic execution, no hidden backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code primarily interfaces with the web3.py library to retrieve blockchain block data and extract timestamps. It handles data type variations (string vs int) in the 'timestamp' field, using a conversion function where necessary. No untrusted input sources or network communications beyond web3 API calls are present. The functions are straightforward data retrieval utilities with no suspicious logic or side effects. The only notable aspect is a warning note advising not to use these functions, which indicates they are intended for informational purposes only, not for production security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for fetching block timestamps. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It does not perform any insecure operations or data leaks.",
