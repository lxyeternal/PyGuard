  "purpose": "Utility functions to retrieve the latest and specific block timestamps from a blockchain node via web3, converting the 'timestamp' field to a datetime object.",
  "sources": "web3.eth.get_block calls retrieving block data, specifically the 'timestamp' field.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; data flows from blockchain responses to datetime conversion.",
  "flows": "web3.eth.get_block -> extract 'timestamp' -> convert to int (if needed) -> datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a warning comment 'Do not use' which appears to be a developer note, not malicious; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward retrieval and conversion of block timestamps, handling both string (hex) and integer formats. The warning comment is likely an internal note and does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious data flows, external network activity, or obfuscation are present. The functions are standard utility code with proper type handling. The minimal security risk score (~0.1) assigned in some reports is justified by the warning comment but does not reflect actual security issues. Malware score remains 0, obfuscation is absent, and overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward utility functions for blockchain timestamp retrieval with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The warning comment is a developer note, not an indicator of malicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent across reports.",
