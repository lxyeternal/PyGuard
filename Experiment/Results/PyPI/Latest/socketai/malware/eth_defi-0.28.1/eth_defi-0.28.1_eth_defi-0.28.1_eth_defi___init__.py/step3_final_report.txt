  "purpose": "Performs a Python environment validation by checking if the current Python version meets the minimum required version (3.10).",
  "sources": "Reads the current Python version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "Raises RuntimeError if the version check fails; no other data sinks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Source: sys.version_info; Sink: RuntimeError raised upon version mismatch.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines a minimum Python version tuple, and immediately checks if the current environment's Python version is below this threshold. If so, it raises a RuntimeError to prevent execution in incompatible environments. The logic is simple, standard, and does not process untrusted data or perform any network or file operations. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is environment validation, which is benign and common.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard environment validation step with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its straightforward nature and assign appropriate scores. No modifications are necessary.",
