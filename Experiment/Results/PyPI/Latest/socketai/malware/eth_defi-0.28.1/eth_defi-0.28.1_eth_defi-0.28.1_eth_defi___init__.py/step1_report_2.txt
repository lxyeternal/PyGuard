{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the eth_defi package, primarily performing a version check for Python compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python interpreter's version information via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input data or could lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "The source (sys.version_info) flows into a version comparison check, which may raise an exception if the version is insufficient.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and standard; no unusual code patterns, obfuscated logic, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The script sets a minimum Python version requirement (3.10). It checks the current Python interpreter version and raises a RuntimeError if the version is lower than the minimum. This is a common and safe validation step to prevent incompatibility issues. There are no external inputs, no data manipulation, or network communications. The code's structure is simple and clear, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic environment validation for Python version compatibility. It is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
