{
  "purpose": "This code sets a minimum Python version requirement for the eth_defi package and performs an early check to ensure the environment meets this requirement.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python interpreter's version information from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The source is sys.version_info, and the flow leads to the version comparison in _check_python_version, which raises an error if the version is insufficient.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no unusual constructs, dynamic execution, or obfuscated patterns. It contains standard version check logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines a minimum Python version tuple, and defines a function to check the current interpreter's version. If the version is too old, it raises a RuntimeError with a clear message. The check is executed immediately upon import, ensuring early validation of the environment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The code is standard for environment validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic environment check to ensure compatibility and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical version check implementation with no anomalies.",
