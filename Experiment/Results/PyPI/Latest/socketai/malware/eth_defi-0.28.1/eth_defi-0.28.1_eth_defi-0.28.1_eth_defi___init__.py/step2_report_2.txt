  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports `sys`.\n- Defines a minimum Python version tuple `(3, 10)`.\n- Implements `_check_python_version()` which compares `sys.version_info` to the minimum version.\n- If the current Python version is below 3.10, raises a `RuntimeError`.\n- Calls `_check_python_version()` immediately upon import.\n\n**Review of Reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify that this is a straightforward, standard version check.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are noted.\n- The logic is simple: compare current Python version to minimum and raise an error if incompatible.\n- No external inputs, data leaks, or malicious code are involved.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n- The code performs a benign environment validation.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The logic is sound, and the implementation is standard.\n- The immediate execution of the check ensures early failure if the environment is incompatible.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk; just a version check)\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- All reports are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No reason to adjust scores based on the provided code.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, nor does it perform any network or file operations that could be exploited.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, safe, and effective version check.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- I agree with the reports' conclusions.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The code is benign and secure in its current form.\n\n**Summary of my own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a simple, safe environment validation step.",
