{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to define a minimal package with a version check for Python 3.10 or later, serving as an initial setup or validation step for the 'eth_defi' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via sys.version_info, which is a built-in Python attribute that provides the current Python version.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data, user input, or external sources that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking sys.version_info against a predefined minimum version, and raising an exception if the Python version is insufficient.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious constructs, or unusual behaviors in the code. It performs a straightforward version check with a clear error message.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module and sets a minimum Python version requirement. It defines a function to compare the current Python interpreter version with the required minimum, raising an error if the version is too low. The function is immediately called, enforcing the version constraint at import time. The code is simple, clean, and standard for dependency version validation. No external input is read, and there are no indicators of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic environment validation to ensure compatibility and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. It is a benign, standard version check without security risks.",
