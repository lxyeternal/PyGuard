  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality and Behavior:**\n   - The code imports `sys` and defines a minimum Python version `(3, 10)`.\n   - It defines `_check_python_version()` which compares the current `sys.version_info` with the minimum version.\n   - If the current Python version is below 3.10, it raises a `RuntimeError`.\n   - The function is called immediately, enforcing environment compatibility at import time.\n\n2. **Assessment of Potential Security Issues or Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code performs a simple version check without processing untrusted data, performing network operations, or executing dynamic code.\n   - No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The logic is straightforward and standard for environment validation.\n\n3. **Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0.\n   - This aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious intent.\n\n4. **Security Risk:**\n   - The code's only action is to halt execution if the environment is incompatible.\n   - This is a benign environment validation step, not a security risk.\n\n5. **Any Errors or Flaws in the Reports?**\n   - The reports consistently identify the code as a standard version check with no anomalies.\n   - They correctly conclude that there are no security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Scores Justification:**\n   - The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n7. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The code enforces a strict environment requirement early, which is good practice.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the basic version check, which is appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, standard environment validation snippet.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity is present.\n- The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk beyond environment validation)\n\n**Final note:** The code is safe, well-implemented, and serves its purpose effectively without introducing security concerns.",
