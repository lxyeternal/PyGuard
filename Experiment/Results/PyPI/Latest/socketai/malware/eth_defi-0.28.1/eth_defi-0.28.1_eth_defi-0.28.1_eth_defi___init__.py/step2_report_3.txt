  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports `sys`.\n- Defines a minimum Python version tuple `(3, 10)`.\n- Implements `_check_python_version()` which compares `sys.version_info` to the minimum.\n- Raises `RuntimeError` if the current Python version is below the minimum.\n- Calls `_check_python_version()` immediately upon import.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No, the code performs a straightforward version check without any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware:** No, the code does not contain any malicious logic, payloads, or obfuscated behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** No, the code is clear and simple.\n- **Security risk:** No, this is a standard environment validation step.\n\n### Review of reports:\nAll five reports agree that:\n- The code is a standard version check.\n- No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or malicious intent.\n- No external data inputs or outputs.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0.\n- Obfuscated score is 0.\n- Security risk score is 0.\n- Confidence is 1 for all, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?** Yes, they are consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Any anomalies or assumptions?** No, all reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?** None. The code performs a simple version check, which is common and safe.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a minimal, standard environment validation.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores across reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign version check, with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code performs a straightforward Python version check, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reported scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a risk score of zero.",
