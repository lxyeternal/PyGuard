{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to define a minimum required Python version for the package and perform an early check to ensure the environment meets this requirement before proceeding.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the system's Python version information via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Python version is too old, which is a control flow sink but not a security-sensitive sink.",
  "flows": "The source (sys.version_info) feeds into a comparison operation; if the check fails, it triggers an exception, terminating the program.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward version checking logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module to access system information, specifically the Python version. It sets a minimum Python version tuple (3,10). The function _check_python_version compares the current Python version with the minimum requirement, raising an exception if the environment is incompatible. The version check is performed immediately after definition, preventing further execution if the environment is outdated. No input data from external sources, no use of environment variables or external files, and no suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment compatibility check with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It ensures the package runs only on compatible Python versions, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
