{
  "purpose": "This code enforces a minimum Python version requirement for the package and provides an initial comment about the package root and API documentation reference.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python interpreter's version information via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Python version is too old, which could halt execution but does not involve untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "The source (sys.version_info) is checked against a predefined minimum version; if the condition fails, a RuntimeError is raised, terminating the program.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code simply performs a version check.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys to access runtime version info, defines a minimum Python version, and performs a comparison. If the current Python version is below the minimum, it raises a RuntimeError to prevent further execution. This is a standard and safe version check implementation. There are no external data inputs or outputs, no malicious code, and no suspicious behaviors or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version compatibility check with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply enforces minimum Python version requirements to ensure compatibility, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
