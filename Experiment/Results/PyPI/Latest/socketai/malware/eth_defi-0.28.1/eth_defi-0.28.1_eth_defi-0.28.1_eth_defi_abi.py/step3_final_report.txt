  "purpose": "Utility functions for loading, caching, encoding/decoding, linking, and managing Ethereum smart contract ABIs and bytecode.",
  "sources": "File system ABI JSON files, contract ABI data, transaction data fields, function signatures, external bytecode and link references.",
  "sinks": "Encoding/decoding functions process data internally; no external untrusted input execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "ABI files -> cache/load functions -> contract creation -> encoding/decoding -> transaction data extraction and processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for placeholder replacement in linking; standard practice, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for Ethereum contract interaction, including ABI loading, caching, encoding/decoding, linking, and transaction data handling. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The placeholder replacement in linking is typical for Solidity library linking. No network activity or data exfiltration is evident. The code relies on well-known libraries and practices, indicating legitimate use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility library for Ethereum smart contract management. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are detected. The low risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) are justified given its utility nature. Overall, it is safe for use in blockchain development environments.",
