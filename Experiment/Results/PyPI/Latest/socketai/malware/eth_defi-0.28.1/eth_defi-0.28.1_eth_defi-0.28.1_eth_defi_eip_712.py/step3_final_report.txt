{
  "purpose": "Provides routines for encoding and signing Ethereum EIP-712 structured data, facilitating secure message signing according to the standard.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include structured message data, domain parameters, and cryptographic keys; nonce generated via secrets.token_bytes(32).",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic functions produce message hashes and signatures; private keys are used for signing but are externally supplied.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into encode_data and encode_type functions, producing hashes via hash_struct, which are then signed with signHash using the private key.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code employs standard cryptographic libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements Ethereum's EIP-712 encoding, hashing, and signing routines using reputable libraries. It handles data serialization, type dependencies, and cryptographic signing securely. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Nonce generation uses cryptographically secure randomness. Private keys are handled externally, which is standard but requires secure management outside this code. The overall structure and functions are clear and standard for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of Ethereum EIP-712 signing routines with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal and primarily related to external private key handling, which is typical for such cryptographic utilities.",
