  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'quicolor' Python package.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the hardcoded package metadata (name, version, author info, description, url, classifiers, python_requires).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded metadata into the setup function, which uses these values for packaging; no external input or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, such as obfuscated logic, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded secrets beyond package metadata. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls the 'setup' function with static, hardcoded metadata describing the package. There are no input reads, no untrusted data processing, and no suspicious code patterns. The setup configuration appears standard and benign. It does not include any code that could be exploited for malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical package setup script with static metadata. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this code. It is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package.",
