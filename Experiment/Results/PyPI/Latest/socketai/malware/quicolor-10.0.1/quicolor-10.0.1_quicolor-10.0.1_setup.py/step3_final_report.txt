  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the 'quicolor' Python library.",
  "sources": "Static strings for package name, version, author, description, URL, classifiers, and the 'install_requires' list.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools, with static metadata and a dependency on 'requests'. It contains no dynamic code, obfuscation, or external input handling. The dependency is common and does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code aligns with typical package setup practices and poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and justified.",
