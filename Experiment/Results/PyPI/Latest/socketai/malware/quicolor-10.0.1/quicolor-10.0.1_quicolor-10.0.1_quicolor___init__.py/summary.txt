  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through covert Telegram data exfiltration triggered automatically during benign utility functions. The embedded credentials, silent operation, and data transmission confirm high malicious intent and security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9, obfuscation 0) are justified and consistent with the observed behavior. The overall assessment indicates a highly malicious and privacy-invasive package that should be flagged and treated as malware."
