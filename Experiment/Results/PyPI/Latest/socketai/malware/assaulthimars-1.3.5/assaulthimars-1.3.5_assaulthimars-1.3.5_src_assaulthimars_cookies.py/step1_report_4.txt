    "Import statements for modules such as calendar, copy, time, threading, and internal utils.",
    "Construction and manipulation of cookies via create_cookie, morsel_to_cookie, and cookiejar_from_dict.",

    "Function get_cookie_header, which adds cookies to a request header.",

  "anomalies": [
    "Use of a dummy threading module fallback, which is standard and not suspicious.",
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected.",
    "No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution present.",
    "Some comments suggest caution with imports, but no malicious code implied.",
    "The functions operate with expected cookie handling logic, no suspicious data leaks or network communications."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements cookie management and compatibility utilities for the requests library, including classes that mimic urllib request/response objects and functions to extract, set, and manipulate cookies. All operations involve standard cookie handling procedures; no network or system calls suggest data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be standard, purpose-driven utility code with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for cookie handling within the requests library, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It facilitates cookie management but does not contain any malicious or sabotage mechanisms.",
