  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard cookie utilities for requests.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, straightforward utility code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no signs of malicious activity. The low security risk score aligns with this. The malware score is appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie management functions, with potential for manipulation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Functions like `remove_cookie_by_name` and `set` could be misused to manipulate cookies maliciously but are standard for cookie management.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** While the functions could be exploited if misused, they are typical for cookie handling. No evidence of malicious intent or malware. The risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable, considering potential misuse but no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for cookie handling, with mock classes.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard utility code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malware or malicious intent detected. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie extraction, management, and conversion.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Uses mock classes, no network or system commands, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is solid. The risk score is slightly higher but still reasonable given the cookie manipulation capabilities, which are standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for cookie management, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard cookie handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned; no malware or risks.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), reflecting potential for misuse but no actual malicious activity.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, readable code.\n- **Security Risk:** Given the functions can manipulate cookies, but no malicious intent, I would assign a **risk score of 0.1 to 0.2** as the reports suggest. I lean towards **0.1**, considering the standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The scores are reasonable and justified based on the code's functionality.\n\n**My final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.1**\n\nThis code is a standard, benign utility module for cookie management with no security risks or malware.",
