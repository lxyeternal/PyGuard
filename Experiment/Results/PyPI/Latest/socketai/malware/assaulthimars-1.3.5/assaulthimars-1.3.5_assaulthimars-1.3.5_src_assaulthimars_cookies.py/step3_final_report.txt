  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing cookies within the requests library, including extraction, creation, and manipulation of cookie objects.",
  "sources": "Reading request headers, response headers, and cookie parameters for creating or extracting cookies.",
  "sinks": "Cookie extraction into jar, header generation for requests, cookie removal and setting functions.",
  "flows": "Request headers are read to produce cookie headers; response headers are parsed to extract cookies; cookies are stored, retrieved, or removed from the jar.",
  "anomalies": "Use of mock classes (`MockRequest`, `MockResponse`) for compatibility; no suspicious data or hardcoded secrets; standard cookie handling functions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie management utilities, including extraction, creation, and removal of cookies. It uses compatibility wrappers to interface with cookie jars and request/response objects. No network activity, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The functions serve typical purposes in cookie handling, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The potential for misuse exists in cookie manipulation functions, but this is inherent to cookie management libraries and does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured utility code for cookie management with no malicious or suspicious features. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1), reflecting minimal risk primarily due to the functions' capacity for cookie manipulation but no actual malicious activity.",
