{
  "purpose": "The script outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package, primarily for configuring SSL/TLS verification.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'where' function from the certifi package, which provides the location of the CA bundle. It also reads from the environment when executed directly to print this path.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the print statement, which outputs the CA bundle path. No untrusted data is processed or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import 'where' from certifi, and when run as main, call 'where()' and print the result. There are no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is simple, self-contained, and does not perform any suspicious actions such as network communication, data modification, or use of environment variables beyond importing a trusted library.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a trusted library (certifi) and outputs the path to its CA bundle. It has no user input handling, no external data processing, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation. The logic is minimal and standard for configuration or informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to reveal the location of the CA bundle used for SSL verification. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a straightforward utility script with no suspicious elements.",
