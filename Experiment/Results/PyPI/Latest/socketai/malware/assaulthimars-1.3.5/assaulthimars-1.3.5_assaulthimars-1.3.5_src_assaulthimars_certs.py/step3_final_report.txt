  "purpose": "Outputs the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' function from certifi, used to retrieve the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs the CA bundle path; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Source: certifi.where() function; Sink: print() function displaying the path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, importing a trusted library function and printing its output. No external inputs, network activity, or data manipulation are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications or concerns are warranted.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, benign utility that outputs the CA bundle path from certifi. All evidence and reports confirm its harmless nature. The current scoring and assessment are accurate and appropriate.",
