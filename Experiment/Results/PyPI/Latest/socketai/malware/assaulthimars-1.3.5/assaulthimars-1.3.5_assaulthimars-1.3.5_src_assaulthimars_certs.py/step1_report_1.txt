  "purpose": "Provide the default CA bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'where' function from the certifi package; calling 'where()' to retrieve CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "Outputting the CA bundle path to stdout.",
  "flows": "Import 'where' -> execute 'where()' -> print the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of a known safe library function. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function 'where' from the certifi package, which returns the path to the trusted CA bundle. It then prints this path when run as a script. There are no data inputs from external sources or untrusted data. The code's purpose is to output the CA bundle location, which is a common and safe operation. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal, clear, and uses standard library functions in a legitimate manner.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility to output the default CA bundle path provided by the certifi package. It does not contain malware or security risks. It is a straightforward, safe utility.",
