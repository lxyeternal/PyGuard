{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple utility to output the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'certifi' package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The output is printed to standard output, which could potentially be captured or redirected but does not directly lead to a security risk.",
  "flows": "The source (certifi.where()) provides a file path, which is printed; no further data flow to external systems or sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' to retrieve the default CA bundle path and prints it. There are no input sources beyond the imported function, no sinks that perform unsafe operations, and no data flows beyond printing the CA bundle location. The code is simple, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It serves as a utility to display the CA certificate path and is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for retrieving and displaying the certifi CA bundle path. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
