{
  "purpose": "Provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used for SSL verification, based on the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package; calls 'where()' to get the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the CA bundle path via print(), which is generally safe; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function provides the CA bundle location, which is printed to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of a well-known, trusted library to obtain CA certificates.",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints its output. It is a minimal utility for displaying the default CA bundle location. There are no inputs, untrusted data, or suspicious behaviors. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for displaying the default CA bundle location from certifi. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
