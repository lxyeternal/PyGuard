{
  "purpose": "This module returns the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the certifi package's where() function to obtain the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "The output of the where() function is printed to stdout.",
  "flows": "The code calls certifi.where() and prints the result directly; no untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward and uses a standard library function.",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports certifi and prints the path to the default CA bundle. There are no external inputs, no data manipulation, no security-sensitive operations beyond reading and printing a file path. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are present. The code is minimal, well-structured, and adheres to typical usage of the certifi library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to output the default CA bundle path. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
