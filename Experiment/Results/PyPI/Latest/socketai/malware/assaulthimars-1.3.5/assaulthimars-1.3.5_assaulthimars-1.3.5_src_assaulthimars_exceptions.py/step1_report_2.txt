{
  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling various error conditions in the requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and .compat, class initializations, attribute access, and method definitions within the exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks such as network transmissions or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is evident; exception handling is standard and does not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code mainly defines structured exception classes with proper inheritance and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of exception classes for the requests library, with clear inheritance from built-in and third-party exceptions. The initial import and class definitions follow standard patterns. The __init__ methods handle optional arguments and maintain proper exception chaining. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated logic is present. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent detected; the structure and content align with conventional exception handling in Python libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception class definitions for the requests library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
