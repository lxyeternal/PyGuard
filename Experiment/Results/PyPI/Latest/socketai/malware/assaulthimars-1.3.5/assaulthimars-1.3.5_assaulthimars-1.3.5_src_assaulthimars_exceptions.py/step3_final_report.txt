{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of exception classes and warnings for the Requests library to handle various HTTP, JSON, connection, and request errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, imports from urllib3.exceptions and .compat modules, and attribute access within exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks; exception classes store references but do not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation with optional response/request objects; no data flow leading to external effects.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward class hierarchy with standard inheritance and no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of exception class definitions with proper inheritance, docstrings, and minimal logic. It imports standard modules and manages exception attributes without executing dynamic code or network operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure aligns with typical Python exception handling for HTTP request libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of exception classes for the Requests library, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks detected.",
