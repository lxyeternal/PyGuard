{
  "purpose": "This module defines various exception classes for the Requests library, providing structured error handling and warnings related to HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, imports modules, and references object attributes such as response and request objects.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include error handling mechanisms that could process untrusted data, but they are primarily exception classes, not data processing points.",
  "flows": "There are no specific source-to-sink data flows; the code defines error classes and initialization logic for exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code follows standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for the Requests library, including inheritance and special methods like __reduce__. It imports necessary modules, defines exception classes with docstrings, and includes some warning classes. No suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscated patterns, and no suspicious network or data access behavior detected. The code appears purely declarative and standard for an exception handling module.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for error handling in HTTP requests. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It appears safe and non-suspicious.",
