{
  "purpose": "Define and handle exceptions related to HTTP requests, JSON decoding, and connection errors within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Potentially untrusted data could originate from HTTP responses, URLs, headers, or request arguments.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling and propagation, especially where untrusted input could trigger exception creation or logging.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input such as response objects, request arguments, or URLs are processed in exception constructors and then propagated through the exception hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The code uses multiple inheritance for exception handling, which is standard for Python exception classes. No suspicious logic, no network connections, or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a set of exception classes for request errors, JSON decoding errors, and related warnings. Exception classes are constructed using standard Python inheritance. The __init__ methods store references to response and request objects but do not perform any malicious actions or data leaks. The code leverages compatibility imports and standard exception handling patterns. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic was found. The presence of exception hierarchy and response/request handling is typical for HTTP client libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard exception definition module for the requests library, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior observed. It serves as part of the error handling framework and does not contain any harmful logic or malware.",
