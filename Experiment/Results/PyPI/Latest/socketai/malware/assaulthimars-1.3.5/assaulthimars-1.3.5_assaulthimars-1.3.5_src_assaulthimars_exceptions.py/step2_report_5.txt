  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a standard set of exception class definitions for the Requests library.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The code imports standard modules, defines exception classes with proper inheritance, and uses typical Python patterns.\n- No data flows or sinks that could lead to security issues are present.\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as error handling infrastructure.\n\n**Assessment of the reports:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** All correctly identify the purpose as defining exceptions, with sources being class definitions and imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of untrusted data processing or malicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The analysis correctly notes the standard nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** All agree on the benign nature, with high confidence scores.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n\n- Malware: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated: All assign 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- Risk: All assign 0, which aligns with the above.\n\n**Justification:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward exception hierarchy for a well-known Python library.\n- No malicious behavior, no suspicious logic, no external network activity.\n- The exception classes are standard and do not perform any data processing or dynamic code execution.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the detailed, consistent, and thorough analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is safe, benign, and standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a normal, safe exception class module.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- No further security concerns.\n\n**Summary:** The module is a benign, standard exception hierarchy for the Requests library, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
