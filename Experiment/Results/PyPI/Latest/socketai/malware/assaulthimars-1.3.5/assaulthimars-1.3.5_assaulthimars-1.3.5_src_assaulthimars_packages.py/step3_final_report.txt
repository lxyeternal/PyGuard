  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by aliasing 'urllib3', 'idna', and optionally 'chardet' modules under 'requests.packages.*' namespace through sys.modules manipulation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet'; sys.modules entries being accessed and modified.",
  "sinks": "sys.modules entries where modules are aliased; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are assigned to sys.modules entries under 'requests.packages.*', creating aliasing for legacy compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional manipulation of sys.modules for namespace aliasing; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific packages and creates aliases within sys.modules to support legacy code expectations. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The sys.modules manipulation, while unconventional, is a known pattern for compatibility. No malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscated score is zero; the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2) due to the manipulation but is benign in this context.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a compatibility shim without malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the slight security risk reflects the unconventional sys.modules manipulation but does not indicate malicious activity.",
