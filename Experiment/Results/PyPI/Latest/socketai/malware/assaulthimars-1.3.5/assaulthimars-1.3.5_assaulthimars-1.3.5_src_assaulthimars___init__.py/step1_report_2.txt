  "purpose": "This code implements an HTTP library named ModernReqs, providing functions for making HTTP requests such as GET and POST, with dependency checks and compatibility handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports modules and dependencies, and decodes a base64-encoded string that appears to contain embedded code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the exec() call that executes decoded code, and the import of various modules and functions which could be misused if manipulated.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing dependencies, performing version checks, decoding a base64 string, executing that code via exec(), and importing various internal modules, potentially executing malicious code embedded in the decoded payload.",
  "anomalies": "The primary anomaly is the use of exec() on a base64-decoded string which appears to contain code, potentially malicious, embedded within the module. The code being executed is obfuscated via base64 encoding, which is suspicious. The presence of this embedded code, executed at runtime, is highly unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by importing standard modules and performing version and dependency checks for urllib3, chardet, charset_normalizer, and cryptography, which is normal for a network library. The key anomaly is the decoding and execution of a base64-encoded string with exec(). This string appears to be embedded code, possibly malicious, as it is encoded and then run dynamically. The rest of the code involves setting up logging, warnings, and importing internal modules and functions, which is typical. However, the execution of arbitrary code from a decoded string indicates a high security concern, as this pattern is commonly used for hiding malicious payloads or backdoors. There are no other suspicious behaviors like hardcoded credentials or network connections in this visible part. Given the obfuscation and execution of embedded code, the overall risk is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed at runtime. This pattern is indicative of potential malicious behavior, such as embedding hidden backdoors or malicious code. The rest of the script appears standard for a network library but is overshadowed by the embedded code execution. Therefore, the package should be treated as malicious or at very high risk.",
