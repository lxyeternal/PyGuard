{
  "purpose": "The code primarily functions as an HTTP library setup with dependency checks and compatibility verifications. It also contains embedded, obfuscated code executed via exec(), which is suspicious.",
  "sources": "The embedded base64-encoded string decoded and executed with exec(), reading static data and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The exec() call on decoded base64 data, which executes arbitrary code at runtime.",
  "flows": "Base64 string decoded -> executed via exec() -> potential malicious payload runs.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a large, base64-encoded string decoded and executed with exec(), indicating obfuscation and dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code contains an embedded base64-encoded payload that is decoded and run using exec(), which is a common technique for hiding malicious code. The rest of the code appears to be standard dependency checks and compatibility verifications for an HTTP library. The use of exec() on obfuscated data is highly suspicious and suggests malicious intent, such as hidden backdoors or payloads. The obfuscation level and runtime execution pattern align with malicious activity indicators. Given the pattern, the embedded code is likely malicious, and the package should be considered compromised until further payload analysis is performed.",
  "conclusion": "The embedded, obfuscated code executed via exec() strongly indicates malicious intent. The pattern of decoding and executing obfuscated payloads is a red flag for malicious activity. Scores of malware (0.9), obfuscated (0.9), and security risk (0.9) are justified. The package poses a high security threat and should be treated as malicious until the payload is examined and verified.",
