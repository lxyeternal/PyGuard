{
  "purpose": "This source code defines a Python HTTP library called ModernReqs, which handles HTTP requests and dependencies, and manages compatibility and security warnings.",
  "sources": "Code reads static data from imports, dependency version variables, and embedded encoded data; also reads environment and system modules for compatibility checks.",
  "sinks": "Uses functions like get, post, delete, etc., which handle untrusted URL inputs; also executes embedded code via exec, and decodes base64-encoded data which could be malicious.",
  "flows": "Input URLs and data flow into HTTP method functions; embedded base64 string decodes into executable code via exec, potentially executing malicious code if the encoded string is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of embedded base64-encoded code executed with exec(), which is unusual and suspicious; reliance on dynamic code execution on embedded data; the code within the exec appears to be a large obfuscated payload.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a library setup with dependency checks, compatibility verifications, and system configuration. The most suspicious aspect is the embedded base64-encoded string decoded and executed via exec(), which indicates potential malicious payload insertion. This embedded code could perform malicious activities such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system compromise. The rest of the code appears to be standard library setup and dependency management, with no other clear malicious behavior. The embedded payload is highly suspicious and suggests malicious intent or compromise of the package.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious embedded payload decoded and executed at runtime, which is a strong indicator of sabotage or malicious intent. Outside this, the rest of the code seems to be legitimate library setup. Overall, high suspicion of malicious behavior due to the embedded, obfuscated code execution.",
