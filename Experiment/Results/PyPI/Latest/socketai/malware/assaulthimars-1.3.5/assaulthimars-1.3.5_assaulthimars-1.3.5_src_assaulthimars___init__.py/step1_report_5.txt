{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python HTTP library called ModernReqs, which provides functions for making HTTP requests such as GET and POST, and manages dependencies and compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imports (e.g., urllib3, charset_normalizer, chardet, ssl, cryptography, local modules), and from the embedded base64-encoded script executed via exec().",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the exec() call executing decoded code, and any network requests made by imported functions (e.g., get, post, request).",
  "flows": "Data flows from the base64-encoded string decoded by exec() into execution; dependencies are checked and warnings are issued; network requests could be made via imported API functions, which are not detailed here.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a base64-encoded string executed via exec() is suspicious, as this can be used to obfuscate malicious code. No other obvious malicious behaviors detected in the visible code; however, the exec() block warrants close inspection.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a legitimate HTTP library setup with dependency checks, compatibility verifications, and configuration. The critical anomaly is the embedded base64 string decoded and executed via exec(), which may contain malicious code or hidden instructions. This obfuscation could enable malicious actions such as code injection or executing harmful payloads. The rest of the code involves standard dependency management, warnings, and import statements with no signs of malicious activity. Due to the embedded exec() with decoded code, suspicion is high, although without analyzing the decoded script content, certainty is limited.",
  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the exec() statement executing decoded code from a base64 string, which is a common obfuscation technique used in malicious scripts. This indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, or at least obfuscation that warrants further inspection. The rest of the code appears legitimate but the exec() call must be scrutinized thoroughly.",
