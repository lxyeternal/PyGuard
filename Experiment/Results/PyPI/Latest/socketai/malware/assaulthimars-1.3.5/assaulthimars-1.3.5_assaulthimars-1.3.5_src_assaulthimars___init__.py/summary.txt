  "conclusion": "The embedded, obfuscated code executed via exec() strongly indicates malicious intent. The pattern of decoding and executing obfuscated payloads is a red flag for malicious activity. Scores of malware (0.9), obfuscated (0.9), and security risk (0.9) are justified. The package poses a high security threat and should be treated as malicious until the payload is examined and verified."
