{
  "purpose": "Provide data structures that support case-insensitive dictionary-like objects and lookup behaviors for the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Data is read from user inputs during dictionary key assignment, updates, or lookups within the classes' methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; data is stored internally in dictionaries and returned via methods without external outputs or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from initialization and method calls into internal storage (_store and __dict__), with retrievals from internal storage and method returns.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, external network access, or privacy leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict, which are standard data structures. CaseInsensitiveDict manages keys case-insensitively while preserving original case for iteration. LookupDict allows attribute-style access to internal dictionary data. Both classes include straightforward methods for data manipulation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network operations, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The implementation appears standard, intended solely for internal data management within the Requests library.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard, non-malicious data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup behaviors. No malicious activity or security risks are identified.",
