{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Data is provided during instantiation or through item assignment (__setitem__ or constructor).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data leading to leaks or effects; no network, file, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into internal storage (self._store or __dict__), primarily for dictionary operations; no external sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. Use of standard Python collections and straightforward methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. Both extend standard Python collections with additional behavior for key handling. No dynamic code execution, network interactions, or sensitive operations are present. Methods perform typical dictionary operations. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard and appears to be purely for data structure management without malicious intent or security risks.",
