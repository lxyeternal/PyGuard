  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Class constructors (__init__), __getitem__ methods, update methods, and property accessors (lower_items, get).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no external untrusted input handling, network operations, or sensitive data access.",
  "flows": "Input data (initialization or key access) flows into internal storage without manipulation, then data is retrieved via key access or iteration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of standard library modules and straightforward class methods.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. Both are used for internal data management within the Requests library. CaseInsensitiveDict normalizes keys to lowercase for case-insensitive operations and retains original key casing for display purposes, with standard dictionary-like behavior. LookupDict is a simple dictionary extension, adding a name attribute for identification. There are no functions or code segments that perform network activity, data exfiltration, or execute malicious operations. No hardcoded credentials, malicious data flows, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code primarily focuses on data structure management, with no apparent security or malware concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of standard, benign data structure implementations with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of the Requests library's internal utilities.",
