{
  "purpose": "Defines internal data structures for case-insensitive dictionary behavior and lookup functionality within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data provided during initialization (__init__), dictionary key access (__getitem__), and update methods.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; data is stored internally without external transmission or system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through update and setitem methods into internal storage, with retrieval via getitem and iteration.",
  "anomalies": "Minor implementation detail in copy() method: returning CaseInsensitiveDict(self._store.values()) may not produce a full copy of the dictionary structure, but it does not introduce security issues.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, well-understood data structures without network activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The classes serve internal utility purposes, with straightforward logic and no external dependencies. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or code injection points are present. The minor issue in the copy() method does not impact security but could affect correctness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
