{
  "purpose": "Define metadata for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "None; all variables are assigned static string or numeric values.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, I/O, or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways, as all variables are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected; no secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with metadata-like information, such as title, description, URL, version, author, email, license, and copyright. All values are hardcoded, static, and do not involve any dynamic or potentially malicious behavior. There are no external calls, data processing, or obfuscated code segments. The presence of potentially provocative or politically charged description strings does not imply malicious intent, especially since the code is only setting metadata variables.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward declaration of package metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It is safe based on the provided content.",
