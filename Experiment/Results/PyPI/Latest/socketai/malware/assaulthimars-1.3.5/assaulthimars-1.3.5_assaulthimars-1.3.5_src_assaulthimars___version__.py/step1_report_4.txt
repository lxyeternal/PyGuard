  "purpose": "Define metadata variables for a Python package or module",
  "sources": "Assignment statements assigning static string and numeric values to variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no input/output operations or data handling",
  "flows": "None; simple static assignments",
  "anomalies": "Use of Unicode escape sequences for emojis in __cake__, which is unusual but not malicious; no other anomalies or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code only sets metadata variables such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright. All values are static literals, with no external input, environment variable access, or dynamic code execution. No evidence of obfuscated code, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The use of emojis via Unicode escapes is benign and likely decorative. Overall, the code appears to serve as metadata definition without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple metadata declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be harmless and intended for informational purposes in a package setup or similar context.",
