  "purpose": "Define package metadata and descriptive information for a Python module or package.",
  "sources": "Assignments to module-level dunder (double underscore) variables for metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only sets static metadata variables.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code simply assigns static string and integer values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code contains only straightforward metadata assignments. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata. The data includes strings, a URL, a version number, a build number (hexadecimal), and emoji characters. There are no input streams, no data manipulation, and no functions or dynamic execution. All data appears to be benign, and no anomalies such as obfuscated code or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign set of package metadata variables with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not read input, send data, or execute any suspicious operations.",
