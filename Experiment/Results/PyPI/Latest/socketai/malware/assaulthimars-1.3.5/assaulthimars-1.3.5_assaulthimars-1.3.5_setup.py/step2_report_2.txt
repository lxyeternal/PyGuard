  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The script is a standard setup.py with use of `exec()` to load version info and `os.system()` for publishing. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The use of `exec()` is potentially risky if the version file is compromised, but this is common in setup scripts. No malware or malicious intent evident.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable scores; low risk, no malware.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard setup procedures, noting `exec()` as a potential concern but assuming safe version files.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Same reasoning; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard setup script, use of `exec()`, `os.system()` for publishing, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous; no malware, low risk.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity, just standard setup routines with `exec()` and `os.system()`.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** No evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusions—standard setup script, `exec()`, `os.system()` for publishing, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2), justified by the use of `exec()` and `os.system()`, which are common but can be risky if the external files or commands are compromised.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The `exec()` usage warrants caution, but in typical setup scripts, it's standard practice assuming the version file is trusted.\n- The `os.system()` calls are straightforward and only invoked with fixed commands, not user input, reducing risk.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, legitimate setup script with minimal security concerns, primarily related to the `exec()` pattern which is common but should be verified that the version file is safe. No malicious activity or malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed to the scores. They are aligned with the code analysis and report reasoning.",
