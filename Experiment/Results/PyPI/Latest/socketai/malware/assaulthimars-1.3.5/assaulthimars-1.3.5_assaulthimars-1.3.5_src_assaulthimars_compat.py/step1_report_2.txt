{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as managing dependencies like urllib3, chardet, and simplejson.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules (importlib, sys, urllib3, chardet, simplejson, collections, http, io, urllib), version detection, and dynamic module loading functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data handling or outputs to external systems are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code primarily sets up compatibility and import configurations without processing external input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward, primarily performing compatibility checks and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes compatibility layers for Python 2 and 3, handles optional imports (like simplejson), detects urllib3 version, and dynamically resolves character detection libraries. It uses standard practices for compatibility and dependency management without any signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. No external data is read or written insecurely, and there are no suspicious code patterns or malicious actions detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility module designed to handle imports, version detection, and library resolution. It does not contain malicious code, malware, or security risks. It is safe and typical for such utility modules.",
