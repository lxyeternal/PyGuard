{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a compatibility layer for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as importing various standard libraries and handling version-specific logic for the 'urllib3' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries and optional third-party libraries ('simplejson', 'chardet', 'charset_normalizer'), as well as version detection logic and dynamic module imports.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data are present; the code primarily performs imports and version checks. No data is written to external systems or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, detecting library versions, and assigning variables based on version detection. There are no complex data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be standard for compatibility purposes and library imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages compatibility between Python versions and optional dependencies. It includes version detection, dynamic module imports, and setting up variables based on environment and library versions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All imports are from standard or well-known third-party libraries, with fallback mechanisms for missing packages. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and import setup module with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs version detection and imports necessary libraries without handling untrusted data or executing malicious behavior.",
