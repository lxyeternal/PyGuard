{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions for handling import issues across Python versions, managing dependencies, and defining some basic type aliases.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from import statements, version checks, and dynamic module imports (e.g., importlib.import_module, import of simplejson/json, urllib libraries).",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks that could process untrusted input leading to vulnerabilities; the code mainly sets up compatibility and imports modules.",
  "flows": "The code flows from version detection and module import attempts to setting global variables for compatibility, with no user input or external data processing involved.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors. The code is straightforward and typical for compatibility modules.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard compatibility handling, including Python version detection, conditional imports, and version checks for urllib3 and simplejson. No code executes untrusted data or external commands. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. The code's purpose is solely to facilitate cross-version compatibility and dependency resolution, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages imports and compatibility checks without processing untrusted data or performing insecure operations.",
