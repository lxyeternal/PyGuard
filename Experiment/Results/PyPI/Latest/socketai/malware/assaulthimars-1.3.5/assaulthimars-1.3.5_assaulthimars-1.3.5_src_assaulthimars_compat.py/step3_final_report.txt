  "purpose": "Compatibility support for Python 2 and 3, dependency resolution, and version detection.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version detection logic, dynamic module imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility module that manages imports, detects Python and urllib3 versions, and resolves character detection libraries. It performs straightforward version checks and dynamic imports without processing untrusted data or executing malicious operations. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code's structure and purpose are clear and typical for such utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility support module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0.",
