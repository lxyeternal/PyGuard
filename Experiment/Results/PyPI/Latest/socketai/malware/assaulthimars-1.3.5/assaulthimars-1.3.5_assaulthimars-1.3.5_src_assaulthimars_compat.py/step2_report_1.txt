  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the provided details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the module as a compatibility support module, with standard import statements and version detection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows or sinks involving untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; straightforward code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, with high confidence, no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is a typical compatibility layer, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly notes dependency handling and compatibility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is standard and safe.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the import handling, version detection, and dynamic library resolution.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Properly notes the compatibility handling, version detection, and imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, focusing on compatibility and dependency imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report notes a very low security risk (0.1), which might be an overestimation given the code's nature.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is purely for compatibility; assigning a security risk of 0.1 seems slightly high but not unreasonable if considering potential future misuse. Still, based on the current code, it's minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0, as expected.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports correctly identify minimal or no risk; the fifth report's 0.1 is slightly cautious but acceptable.\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a standard compatibility and import setup module, with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score is **0**.\n- The overall risk score should be **0**, as there's no evidence of security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0** — no security risk present.\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
