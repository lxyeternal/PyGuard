{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility support for Python 2 and Python 3, as well as importing and version detection utilities for dependencies like urllib3 and chardet.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (importlib, sys, collections, http, io, urllib), dynamic import of chardet or charset_normalizer, version info from urllib3, and local function definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network, file, or system command interactions that handle external input.",
  "flows": "The code primarily initializes modules and sets compatibility flags, with no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward, with standard compatibility and import handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation evident.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up compatibility support between different Python versions, detects the version of urllib3, and dynamically resolves character detection libraries. It handles module imports with fallbacks, defines compatibility variables, and imports common modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All imported modules are standard, and the logic is simple and well within expected functionality for a compatibility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard compatibility and utility setup module for a Python project, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions to ensure cross-version support and proper dependency handling without executing any harmful operations.",
