{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as handling dependencies like urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson, and various URL and cookie utilities.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module for chardet/charset_normalizer; import statements for standard libraries; sys.version_info for Python version detection.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not handle or process untrusted input directly or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system modification.",
  "flows": "The code primarily initializes modules and compatibility settings, without processing untrusted data or executing external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. The code performs standard compatibility and import handling without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with documentation and import statements to handle compatibility issues between Python 2 and 3. It attempts to determine the urllib3 version and loads character detection libraries ('chardet' or 'charset_normalizer') dynamically. It detects Python version for conditional logic. It then conditionally imports 'simplejson' or defaults to 'json' and keeps backward compatibility with collections. It imports URL and cookie handling modules from urllib. It assigns built-in types to variables for compatibility. All operations are straightforward initializations, compatibility handling, and imports without executing untrusted code or interacting with external data sources. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3 environments, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe import operations and version detection without processing untrusted data or executing external commands.",
