  "purpose": "Attempt to import the 'pyprettifier' module and initialize an EmojiConverter object; if import fails, log the error to a temporary file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import of 'pyprettifier' and the exception message if import fails.",
  "sinks": "Writing to '/tmp/a' in case of ImportError; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Import 'pyprettifier' -> if import fails, exception message is written to '/tmp/a'.",
  "anomalies": "The code logs import errors to a temp file, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a third-party module 'pyprettifier'. If the module is absent, it catches the ImportError and logs the error message to '/tmp/a'. The logging to a temp file may be for debugging or error tracking but does not constitute malicious behavior. There are no other data flows, no use of untrusted input beyond the import error, and no suspicious network activity or backdoors. The overall logic is straightforward and benign, with only a potentially unnecessary error logging step.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly handling import errors by logging them. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
