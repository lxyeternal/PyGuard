{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import a module and create an instance of a class from it, handling import errors by writing to a temporary file.",
  "sources": "The import statement for 'pyprettifier' and the exception handling block that writes to '/tmp/a'.",
  "sinks": "Writing to '/tmp/a' in case of ImportError.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import 'pyprettifier' (source); on failure, write error message to '/tmp/a' (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of a try-except block that silently logs import errors to a temporary file; no other suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function 'after_install' that tries to import the 'pyprettifier' module and instantiate 'EmojiConverter'. If the import fails, it writes the error message to '/tmp/a'. There are no network calls, no credential handling, or data exfiltration. The exception handling simply logs errors locally, which is a common debugging pattern. No malicious behavior such as data theft, system modification, or covert communication is apparent. The code appears to be a minimal, benign setup or check routine, possibly for a package installation process.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic import check and logs errors to a temp file if the module is missing. There is no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious activity. The use of the temp file is benign and typical for debugging or install scripts.",
