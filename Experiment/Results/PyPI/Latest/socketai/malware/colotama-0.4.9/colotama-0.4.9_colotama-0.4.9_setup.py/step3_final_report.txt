  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'colotama' package that installs dependencies and executes a script during installation.",
  "sources": "sys.executable, os.path.join(dir, 'colotama'), call() with shell=True",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call() executing commands/scripts, writing exceptions to /tmp/a",
  "flows": "Dynamic command strings constructed from system paths and executed via shell, executing 'colotama' script",
  "anomalies": "Use of shell=True with dynamically constructed commands, executing unvalidated scripts from installation directory, unconditional package installation",
  "analysis": "The code performs package setup with a custom install class that runs a post-install function. This function prints separators, installs 'pyprettifier' via pip, and executes a script/file named 'colotama' from the installation directory. Both subprocess calls use shell=True with commands built from system variables, which can be exploited if manipulated. No obfuscation or hardcoded malicious code is present, but the practices pose security risks. The code could be exploited to run malicious scripts if the environment or files are compromised, but no active malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or obfuscation but employs insecure subprocess practices that could be exploited. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is moderate (~0.5). The main concern is the unsafe execution of external scripts and commands, which could be dangerous if environment variables or files are manipulated.",
