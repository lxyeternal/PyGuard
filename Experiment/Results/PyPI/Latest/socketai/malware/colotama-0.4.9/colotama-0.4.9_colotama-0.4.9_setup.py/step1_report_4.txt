{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'colotama' Python package that installs dependencies and runs post-install commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system's Python executable, the installation directory, and attempts to run pip install and execute the 'colotama' directory as a script.",
  "sinks": "Calls to system shell via 'call' with potentially untrusted input, executing 'pip install pyprettifier' and running a directory as a script.",
  "flows": "sys.executable and install directory used to construct commands executed via subprocess call, which could execute arbitrary code if manipulated.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'shell=True' with formatted strings that incorporate system variables, which can be exploited. Also, the directory name 'colotama' is executed as a script, which may be dangerous if the directory contents are malicious or if the name is manipulated.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation process that, during post-install, prints separator lines, then attempts to install 'pyprettifier' via pip using the current Python executable. It also executes a directory named 'colotama' as a script. The use of 'shell=True' with formatted strings that include system paths introduces potential command injection risks. The code captures ImportError during the pip installation and writes to a temporary file, which does not present an immediate malicious intent but indicates the script's capability to execute system commands. Overall, the script's primary function is to run system commands that could be exploited if variables are manipulated, and it does not perform any clear malicious activity but does have potential security concerns due to command execution practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a setup script with post-install commands that execute system calls, which could be risky if manipulated. It does not contain explicit malicious behavior but employs practices (like shell=True with formatted strings) that could be exploited. The overall risk is moderate, primarily due to the command execution approach.",
