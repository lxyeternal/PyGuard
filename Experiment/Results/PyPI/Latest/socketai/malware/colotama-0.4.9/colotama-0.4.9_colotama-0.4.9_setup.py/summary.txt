  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or obfuscation but employs insecure subprocess practices that could be exploited. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is moderate (~0.5). The main concern is the unsafe execution of external scripts and commands, which could be dangerous if environment variables or files are manipulated."
