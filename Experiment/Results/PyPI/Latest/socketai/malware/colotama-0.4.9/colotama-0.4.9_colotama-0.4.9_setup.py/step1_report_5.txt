  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'colotama' that installs dependencies and runs post-install commands.",
  "sources": "sys.executable, os.path.join(dir, 'colotama')",
  "sinks": "call([f\"{_a} -m pip install pyprettifier\"], shell=True), call([f\"{_a} {_b}\"], shell=True)",
  "flows": "The script executes a pip install of 'pyprettifier' and then runs a script located at the 'colotama' directory within the installation folder.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'shell=True' with formatted strings that include the Python executable and paths, which could be manipulated if the environment is compromised. The post-install script calls an external process unconditionally, which can be a security concern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a post-install function that prints a separator, installs 'pyprettifier' via pip, then executes a script located in the 'colotama' directory. It catches ImportError exceptions and writes them to '/tmp/a'. The usage of 'shell=True' in subprocess calls, combined with string formatting that includes executable paths, can lead to command injection if the environment is manipulated. The script does not appear to contain obfuscated code or malicious payloads directly, but executing arbitrary scripts during post-install is risky. The installation process seems straightforward, but the unconditional execution of external commands raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard package setup tasks but executes external commands during post-install, which could be exploited if environment variables or the environment itself are compromised. It does not contain explicit malware or obfuscated code but should be reviewed for safe environment execution. Overall, moderate risk due to external process execution during setup.",
