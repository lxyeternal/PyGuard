  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data sources; simply imports a module",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code present; extremely minimal code structure",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python package initializer that imports a 'cli' object from the local module 'cli'. It does not contain any data processing, user input, or network operations. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The code appears typical for a Python package setup and does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package initialization with an import statement, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
