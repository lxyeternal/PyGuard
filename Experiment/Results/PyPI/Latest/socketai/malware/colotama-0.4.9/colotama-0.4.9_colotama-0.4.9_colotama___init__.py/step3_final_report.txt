{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer that exposes the 'cli' component for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file that imports 'cli' from a local module. It contains no data flows, network activity, or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1—are appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization script with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
