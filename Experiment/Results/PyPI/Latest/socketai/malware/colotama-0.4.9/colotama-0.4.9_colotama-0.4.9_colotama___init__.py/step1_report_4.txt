  "purpose": "Import the CLI command from the cli module to expose it as part of the package's interface.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'cli' object from the local module '.cli'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "Imports the 'cli' object from the local module; no data flow involving external input or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement with no unusual language features or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization that imports a command-line interface component. It contains no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious constructs. Its simplicity and standard structure suggest no malicious intent. Since it only performs a basic import, it doesn't introduce security risks or malware potential.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard module import statement with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
