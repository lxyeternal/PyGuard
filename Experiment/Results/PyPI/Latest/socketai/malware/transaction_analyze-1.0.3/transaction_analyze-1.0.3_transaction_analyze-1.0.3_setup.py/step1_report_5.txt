{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'transaction_analyze', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The source code reads static data such as package name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies from hardcoded values within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or where untrusted input could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data, as all inputs are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard setuptools syntax; all data appears to be hardcoded metadata. The license 'Python Script' is unconventional but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and extras for development. No dynamic code execution, no user input handling, and no obfuscated or suspicious code segments are present. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data leakage, or backdoors. The license field value is unusual but not harmful. Overall, this appears to be a benign package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It only contains static metadata and dependency declarations, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
