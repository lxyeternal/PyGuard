  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for Python project 'transaction_analyze'.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call: package name, version, description, author, license, dependencies, and extras.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or external inputs are used.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual license string 'Python Script' is non-standard but not malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. Dependencies are standard, and the license string, while unconventional, does not pose security risks. Multiple reviews agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior, and the scores are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
