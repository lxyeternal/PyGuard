  "purpose": "Define the package setup configuration for the 'transaction_analyze' Python project.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() call, including package name, version, description, author, license, dependencies, and extras.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted input handling or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this is a static configuration script with no data flow or runtime input/output handling.",
  "anomalies": "The license field is set to 'Python Script', which is unconventional and might be a placeholder rather than an actual license; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution. All parameters are static strings or lists; no dynamic code execution or external data sources are involved. The dependencies listed are standard Python packages. The license field value is unusual but not inherently malicious. The overall structure appears standard for a setup.py script, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a standard package configuration file with no malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor concern is the non-standard license description, but it does not pose security issues.",
