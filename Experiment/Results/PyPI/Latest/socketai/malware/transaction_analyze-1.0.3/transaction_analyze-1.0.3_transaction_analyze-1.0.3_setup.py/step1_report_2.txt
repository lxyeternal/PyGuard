  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for publishing 'transaction_analyze' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static variables within the setup() function, such as package name, version, description, author, license, dependencies, and extras.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data inputs; the code solely specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static configuration parameters are assigned directly to setup() arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or malicious constructs. The license 'Python Script' is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to configure a Python package. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and optional development requirements. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The dependencies are standard, and there are no dynamic executions or suspicious constructs. The license field is non-standard but not harmful.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It serves to configure the package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
