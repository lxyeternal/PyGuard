{
  "purpose": "The code appears to prepare and save a graph representation in JavaScript format and update a graph based on selected cryptocurrency data.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'json_dump' parameter, reads/writes files ('filename.js'), and calls external functions like get_binance_data and create_trend_plot.",
  "sinks": "Writes JavaScript data to a file, potentially exposing data if filename is untrusted; calls external functions that fetch data and generate plots.",
  "flows": "json_dump input -> written to JavaScript file; selected_coin/selected_interval -> data fetched via get_binance_data -> data processed and plotted via create_trend_plot.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code for HTML file modification; no suspicious or malicious code present; no hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file operations, data processing, and plotting functions typical in data visualization workflows. It reads data from parameters and external functions, then writes a JavaScript file. The commented code for modifying an HTML file is benign and possibly for UI updates. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious network activity are evident. The code’s security risk is low; it relies on external functions whose behavior isn't shown but are assumed to be standard data fetching and plotting routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data visualization script with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs file I/O and data plotting without suspicious or harmful operations.",
