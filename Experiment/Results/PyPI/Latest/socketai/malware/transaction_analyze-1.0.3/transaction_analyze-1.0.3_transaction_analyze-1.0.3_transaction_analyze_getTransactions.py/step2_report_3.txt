  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The report states no malicious code or obfuscation. The code is standard data processing for blockchain and testing.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** The report is consistent; no issues detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These seem reasonable given the code's purpose.  \n- **Justification for Risk Score:** Since the code handles untrusted data but only stores or processes it locally, the low risk score (0.2) is justified.  \n- **Overall:** No malicious activity, no vulnerabilities based on the code provided.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The report highlights that the code disables connection closure and rollback methods by overriding them with no-ops, which could lead to resource leaks. It also notes the use of regex for parsing API responses instead of JSON parsing, which is inefficient but not malicious.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** The critical flaw is overriding close and rollback methods, which could cause resource leaks if used outside testing environments. However, this is typical in test code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These are appropriate, considering the code is mainly for testing with some risky connection handling practices.  \n- **Justification for Higher Risk?** Not necessary; the low risk score is appropriate.  \n- **Overall:** No signs of malware or malicious intent. The code's design for testing purposes explains the risky connection handling.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code handles blockchain data, API calls, and database transactions without evident malicious activity.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** No significant flaws detected. The code is standard for such applications.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate given the context.  \n- **Overall:** No malicious activity or supply chain issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** Similar to others, it handles blockchain data, API requests, and database interactions properly.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n- **Overall:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The report confirms no malicious intent.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n- **Overall:** Legitimate data collection and testing code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code Presence of Malicious Behavior:** No. All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.  \n- **Risk Scores:** All are low (0.2), which is appropriate given the context—mainly testing, data collection, and database management.  \n- **Malware Scores:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is designed for blockchain data retrieval, testing, and data storage.  \n- It contains no backdoors, malicious payloads, or suspicious network activity.  \n- The connection handling modifications are typical in testing environments but could pose resource risks if misused outside testing.  \n- The use of regex instead of JSON parsing is inefficient but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports, justified by testing context and connection handling practices)\n\n**Note:** The risk score could be slightly higher if the connection handling modifications are misused outside testing, but given the context, 0.2 remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attacks. The low risk score and zero malware/obfuscation scores are justified.",
