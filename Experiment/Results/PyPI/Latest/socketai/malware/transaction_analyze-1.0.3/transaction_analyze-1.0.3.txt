While no active malicious actions are demonstrated, the pattern suggests potential malicious intent. Further dynamic analysis or network monitoring is recommended before definitive judgment. The scores should reflect moderate concern, emphasizing caution due to obfuscation and suspicious URLs."

Given the high obfuscation and dynamic execution, the code poses a significant security threat and should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious."

These indicators justify a high malware likelihood and security risk. The cryptographic functions, while legitimate, are standard and could be exploited. The overall assessment indicates a high probability of malicious intent, warranting caution and further investigation."

All evidence points to malicious intent, warranting a high severity classification and cautious handling."
