{
  "purpose": "The code monitors a list of cryptocurrency wallets for balance changes and new transactions, logging and alerting on such events.",
  "sources": "Input data includes wallet addresses and metadata provided via the 'wallets' parameter; network responses from 'https://blockchain.info/rawaddr/{wallet_address}'.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external blockchain.info API; file writing operations; playing sounds with winsound; printing to console.",
  "flows": "Wallet address inputs lead to API requests; responses are parsed for transaction data; transaction hashes and balances are checked and logged; alerts are triggered for new transactions and balance changes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an infinite loop with a sleep delay; the 'processed_transactions' set is reinitialized within each loop iteration, preventing persistent tracking of processed transactions; no explicit validation of API responses; potential untracked data leaks if exceptions occur; the 'requester' function concatenates input directly into URL without validation; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed for monitoring wallet balances and transactions, and it performs network requests and file I/O for logging. The 'processed_transactions' set is re-created on each loop iteration, which undermines its purpose of avoiding duplicate processing across cycles. The code executes API calls to 'blockchain.info', which is a legitimate service; no suspicious URL manipulations or obfuscated code are present. The 'requester' function directly appends the input string to the URL, but since it is only used for a GET request, it does not constitute malicious behavior unless user input is maliciously crafted, which is not evident here. The code plays sounds upon detecting transactions, which is benign. No code injection, data leakage, or backdoors are detected. Overall, the code appears legitimate for wallet monitoring with minor logical flaws rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a wallet monitoring tool without any clear malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The main concern is the ineffective transaction processing logic due to reinitializing 'processed_transactions' each cycle, which is a functional bug rather than malicious activity. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are identified.",
