{
  "purpose": "A wallet monitoring script that periodically fetches blockchain data, detects balance changes and transactions, logs events, and plays a sound alert upon new transactions.",
  "sources": "API responses from https://blockchain.info/rawaddr/{wallet_address}, reading wallet data, and reading transaction timestamps.",
  "sinks": "Logging to file, printing to console, playing sound via winsound, and updating wallet data structures.",
  "flows": "API response data flows from requests.get to data parsing, then to balance and transaction processing, with transaction hashes checked against processed set, and events logged or alerted.",
  "anomalies": "Reinitialization of 'processed_transactions' each cycle prevents effective deduplication; missing imports ('time', 'datetime', 'winsound') and undefined variables ('GREEN', 'RED', 'ENDC') indicate incomplete code; hardcoded sound filename; infinite loop without exit condition.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard wallet monitoring functions: fetching data, detecting balance changes, logging transactions, and alerting. It contains logical flaws such as resetting 'processed_transactions' each cycle, which hampers duplicate detection, and missing imports that would cause runtime errors. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The use of external sound files and API calls is typical for such tools. The overall behavior is benign, with low security risk primarily due to code incompleteness and minor logical bugs. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is approximately 0.2.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign wallet monitoring script with some logical and completeness issues but no malicious intent or malware. The low risk score reflects minor operational flaws rather than security threats. All reports' assessments are consistent with this conclusion.",
