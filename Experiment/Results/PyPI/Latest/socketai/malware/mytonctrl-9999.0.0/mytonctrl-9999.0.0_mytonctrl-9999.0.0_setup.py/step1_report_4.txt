{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'mytonctrl' package, including a custom installation step that exfiltrates system information.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname, current working directory, and username during the installation process; loading README.md file.",
  "sinks": "Sending HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL with system information parameters during installation.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from hostname, cwd, and username, then transmitted via requests.get() to the specified URL during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code exfiltrating system info during package installation; no user consent or explicit reason for this behavior; use of a suspicious domain for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, but includes a custom install command that sends system hostname, current directory, and username to an external server. This behavior is suspicious and indicates potential malicious activity or privacy violation. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious payloads beyond this exfiltration. No other malicious code, such as backdoors, data theft, or system damage, is evident. The exfiltration occurs automatically during installation, which is an unusual and potentially malicious behavior. The rest of the setup code appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior in the form of data exfiltration during package installation. This indicates a supply chain attack or privacy invasion attempt. The rest of the code is standard setup boilerplate, but the exfiltration behavior is malicious and warrants caution.",
