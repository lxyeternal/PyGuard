{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup process that includes a custom installation step for data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "The CustomInstall.run() method reads system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and sends it via HTTP GET request to a remote URL during package installation.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call transmits data to an external server, potentially leaking sensitive system information.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the system information is collected (source) and sent over the network via requests.get() (sink), constituting a source-to-sink flow with exfiltration intent.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes network transmission of host-specific data during installation, which is not typical for standard setup scripts. The URL used for exfiltration is suspicious and external.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup utilities and third-party libraries. A custom installation class overrides run() to perform standard installation plus data exfiltration. It collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data to a remote server via a GET request, indicating possible malicious intent. The setup() call integrates this custom class, and no other suspicious code is present. The exfiltration occurs silently during install, which is atypical and indicative of malicious activity.\n\nOverall, the code embeds malicious behavior in the installation process by secretly transmitting system info to an external server, constituting a supply chain attack vector.\n\nNo other malicious or suspicious code features are detected outside this exfiltration behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior designed for data exfiltration during package installation. This is a clear security threat and should be regarded as malicious malware embedded in a seemingly legitimate setup script.",
