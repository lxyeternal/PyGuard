{
  "purpose": "The code performs system info exfiltration during package installation by sending hostname, current directory, and username to an external URL, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method of the CustomInstall class, specifically the requests.get() call with system info parameters.",
  "sinks": "The external URL 'https://0no5igfzh7uwsmzmvvr9eyfy6pcg0eo3.oastify.com' where data is transmitted, potentially leading to data theft or privacy violations.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, cwd, username) is collected in the run() method and sent via HTTP GET request to the external URL during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration during setup without user consent, embedded in setup.py, with no obfuscation or user notification.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a straightforward, unambiguous malicious behavior: exfiltration of system info during installation. The exfiltration occurs via a requests.get() call within a custom install class, which is not standard practice. The URL used is suspicious. The code is not obfuscated, and the behavior is consistent across reports. The scores assigned in the reports (close to 1 for malware and security risk) are justified given the privacy breach and supply chain attack vector. No logical errors or false assumptions are evident; the behavior is clearly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script embeds malicious exfiltration code that transmits system information to an external server during installation. This constitutes a high-severity supply chain attack and privacy violation. The malware and security risk scores should be set to 1 to reflect the maximum threat level.",
