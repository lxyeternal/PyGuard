  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with exfiltration URL",
  "flows": "During installation, system info is collected and sent to an external server via HTTP GET request.",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom install class to send system data externally; no validation or obfuscation of URL; no user consent prompts.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup process for a Python package with a custom installation step that captures hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL. The exfiltration occurs unconditionally during installation, which is suspicious. The URL used appears malicious or at least suspicious, indicating possible data leakage or privacy violation. There are no obfuscated parts or code that suggests hidden functionality. The rest of the setup code is standard and does not contain any malicious behavior. The exfiltration is the primary concern, as it collects system information without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes a malicious component that exfiltrates system information during installation, which constitutes a privacy violation and potential security risk. The rest of the code is standard setup code, but the exfiltration behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
