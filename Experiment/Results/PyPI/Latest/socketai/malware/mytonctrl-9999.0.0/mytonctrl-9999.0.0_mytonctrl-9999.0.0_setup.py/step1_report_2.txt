{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the installation process for the 'mytonctrl' package, including custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current working directory, and username; loads README.md; package data files; package metadata from parameters.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call transmits system information to an external URL, potentially exfiltrating sensitive data.",
  "flows": "During installation, system info (hostname, cwd, username) is collected and sent over the network via requests.get() to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a hidden exfiltration step embedded in a custom install class, which is unusual and suspicious for a setup script. No other anomalies are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a custom install class that overrides the run method. After executing the standard install process, it collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL. The setup() call uses this custom class, embedding potentially malicious behavior. The rest of the code appears standard for a Python package setup, with no other suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden exfiltration mechanism embedded within the custom installation process, which is malicious and breaches user privacy. The rest of the script is standard packaging code. Overall, the malicious behavior significantly outweighs the benign aspects.",
