  "purpose": "Setup script for Python package 'mytonctrl' that includes a custom installation process.",
  "sources": "Reading package data, importing modules, reading README.md, and during custom install run method.",
  "sinks": "Requests made to external URL with system information during installation.",
  "flows": "Code flow from import statements to package setup, with data exfiltration happening in the custom run method during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The CustomInstall class performs an HTTP GET request to an external URL with hostname, current directory, and username data, which appears to be exfiltration. No user consent or security prompts are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py with a custom install command that gathers system information and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external domain. This behavior occurs unconditionally during installation, indicating potential malicious intent for data exfiltration. No other malicious code, such as backdoors or system damage, is evident. The external URL looks suspicious, and the data sent includes identifiable system info. The rest of the code is typical package setup, with no other suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior in the form of automatic data exfiltration during installation, which constitutes a security risk. This behavior is hidden inside a custom installation class and is highly suspicious. The rest of the code appears normal.",
