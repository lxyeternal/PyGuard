  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Assessment:** Confirms that the code is a standard setup.py with static metadata, no dynamic input, no suspicious behavior.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n   - **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious logic or obfuscation. The high confidence score (1.0) is appropriate.\n   \n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Assessment:** Also describes a benign, static setup script with no external data sources or suspicious patterns.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n   - **Justification:** No malicious or obfuscated code present. The report's conclusion aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   \n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports; standard setuptools configuration with static metadata.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n   - **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n   \n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Assessment:** Again, a straightforward setup script with static data, no suspicious behavior.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n   - **Justification:** Consistent with the previous findings; no issues detected.\n   \n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Assessment:** Same as above; standard package setup with no dynamic or malicious code.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n   - **Justification:** No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, static setup script with no malicious or obfuscated components.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** All assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the simplicity of the code, there is no reason to suspect any hidden malicious intent.\n- The high confidence scores (1.0) are justified based on the thorough analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis setup.py script is benign and typical for Python packaging.",
