  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'websend' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata such as package name, version, author, description, and package list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or data that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only contains static metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code appears to be a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the setuptools library and calls the setup() function with static, hardcoded package information. It does not execute any dynamic code, network operations, or contain any suspicious constructs. The code is a typical package setup configuration used in Python projects and does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security issues based on its content. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
