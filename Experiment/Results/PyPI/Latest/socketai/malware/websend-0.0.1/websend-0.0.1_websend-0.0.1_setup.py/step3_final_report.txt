  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Import of setuptools and call to setup() with hardcoded package information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static metadata used only for package configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A - static data used solely within setup() call; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static setup.py script that imports setuptools and invokes setup() with fixed parameters. No dynamic inputs, external data, or malicious behaviors are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
