  "purpose": "Decode and execute a heavily obfuscated payload, likely malicious.",
  "sources": "Reversal of string, base64 decoding, zlib decompression, dynamic import, and exec() call.",
  "sinks": "exec() on decompressed code, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "Reversal of string -> base64 decode -> zlib decompress -> exec()",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via string reversal, base64, zlib, and immediate execution without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda that reverses a large string, decodes it from base64, decompresses with zlib, then executes the result. This pattern is a classic malware obfuscation technique used to conceal malicious payloads. The use of dynamic imports and immediate execution of decompressed code indicates malicious intent, typical of backdoors or malware loaders. The obfuscation layers and the lack of any validation or sanitization further increase suspicion. All reports correctly identify these behaviors, assigning high malware and risk scores. The pattern is consistent with malicious code designed to hide and run harmful payloads at runtime.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and almost certainly malicious, employing multiple obfuscation layers to conceal a payload that is executed dynamically. It should be treated as malicious, and further analysis of the payload is recommended before any deployment or use.",
