  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The dependencies are common and used for GUI automation, image processing, and network requests.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.5.  \n  The securityRisk score is 0, which aligns with the conclusion; 0.5 might be more appropriate if considering minimal inherent risks in dependencies, but since no suspicious activity is indicated, 0 is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes the script as a typical setup configuration with benign dependencies. It notes the potential for the console script to execute code but finds no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n  The securityRisk of 0.2 is acceptable, reflecting a very low risk due to the nature of dependencies and setup. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent, and the scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, confirming the script is standard and benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0.  \n  This is consistent with the report's conclusion.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the report finds no suspicious activity, with dependencies and setup code being typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n  Slightly higher than previous, but still negligible. The reasoning supports this.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, the report notes no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0.  \n  Appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no indication of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward setup script.\n- **Risk Scores:** Generally very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are acceptable, given the dependencies and potential execution of scripts, but no actual malicious activity is evident.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.2 — very low, consistent with benign setup scripts.\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Note:** Always monitor for dynamic behavior during runtime, but based solely on this static setup code, there are no security concerns.",
