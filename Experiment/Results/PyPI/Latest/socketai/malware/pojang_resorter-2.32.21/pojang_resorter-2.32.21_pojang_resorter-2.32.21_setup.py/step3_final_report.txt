  "purpose": "Define package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and Python version constraints for the 'pojang_resorter' package.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: package name, version, find_packages(), install_requires, entry_points, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of 'pojang_resorter.main:main' via console_scripts entry point (potential code execution during runtime, but not during setup).",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; static configuration with dependencies and entry point declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; dependencies are common packages; no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It specifies dependencies used for GUI automation, image processing, HTTP requests, and testing. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or system modifications are present. The dependencies are typical and do not indicate malicious intent. The entry point points to a main function, which is standard for CLI tools. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are detected. The code's static nature and dependency list suggest benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard configuration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The dependencies are common, and the code does not perform any suspicious operations. The slight elevation in security risk scores in some reports (0.1-0.2) is unwarranted; a score of 0.0 is appropriate. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is negligible.",
