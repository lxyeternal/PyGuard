  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard configuration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The dependencies are common, and the code does not perform any suspicious operations. The slight elevation in security risk scores in some reports (0.1-0.2) is unwarranted; a score of 0.0 is appropriate. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is negligible."
