{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the 'pojang_resorter' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, entry points, and Python version requirements.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from static strings, lists, and function calls such as find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or system modifications occur in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; dependency list and setup configuration are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. Usage of common setup tools and dependencies appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard Python packaging conventions with setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, console script entry points, and Python version constraints. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or system modifications are evident. All dependencies listed are commonly used packages for GUI automation, image processing, HTTP requests, and testing, with no indication of malicious intent. The setup process is straightforward and adheres to typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code fragment.",
