  "purpose": "Display a stylized ASCII art header and command help information for a CLI tool using argparse with color formatting.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsed via argparse; static ASCII art and color codes for output.",
  "sinks": "stdout printing of ASCII art, headers, and help messages; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv processed by argparse, leading to static output with no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to display ASCII art and colored headers, then sets up argparse subcommands. It only reads command-line arguments and prints static, aesthetic output. No external data fetching, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. The code is simple, clear, and purely for UI presentation. No malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI help utility with aesthetic enhancements, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. The provided reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
