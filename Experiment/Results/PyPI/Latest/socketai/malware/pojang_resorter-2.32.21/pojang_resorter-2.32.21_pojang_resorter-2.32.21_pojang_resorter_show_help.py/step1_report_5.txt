  "purpose": "Provides a CLI tool for interacting with a Python-Mojang system, primarily displaying help information and command options.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine user commands.",
  "sinks": "Outputs ASCII art and command help messages to the console; no data leaks or untrusted data handling beyond standard argument parsing.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv is parsed by argparse; displayed output is static or derived from internal variables; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Uses ANSI escape codes for color output, but this is benign. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to display help information with ASCII art and colors, utilizing argparse for command parsing. No input data is used beyond command-line arguments, and output is purely informational. There are no network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious code actions present. The structure is straightforward and does not perform any harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help display script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply presents ASCII art and command descriptions based on user input. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
