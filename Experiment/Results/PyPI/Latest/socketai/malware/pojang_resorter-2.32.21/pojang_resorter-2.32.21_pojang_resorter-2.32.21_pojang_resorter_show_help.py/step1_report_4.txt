  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool for interacting with Python-Mojang services, displaying help information with ASCII art and colored formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine which subcommand to display or execute.",
  "sinks": "Outputs ASCII art, colored text, and help messages to standard output; no external data or untrusted input is directly written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "User input via command-line arguments determines which help or subcommand information is displayed; no data flows into external systems or files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ASCII art and colored terminal output appears purely aesthetic; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to display help information with ASCII art and colors, utilizing argparse for command parsing. It handles subcommands related to server management. No external data is read beyond command-line args, and there are no sinks involving external system calls, network, or sensitive data. The code structure is straightforward and intended for user interaction, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign CLI helper utility for a Python-Mojang interaction tool. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. The usage of ASCII art and colored output is purely aesthetic and does not impact security.",
