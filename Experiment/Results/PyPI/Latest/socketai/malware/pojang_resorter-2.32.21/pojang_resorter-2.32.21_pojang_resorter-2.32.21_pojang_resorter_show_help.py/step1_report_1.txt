{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface (CLI) with help and command options for a Python-Mojang interaction tool.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments processed by argparse; display of ASCII art and colored text in the terminal.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is directly used in sensitive operations, nor are there outputs to external systems.",
  "flows": "User input (argv) -> argparse parsing -> command dispatch (no further data processing or external communication).",
  "anomalies": "Use of ASCII art and color codes appears purely aesthetic; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up command-line argument parsing with subcommands, prints ASCII art and colored headers for visual appeal. No data is fetched from external sources, nor is there code execution based on untrusted input beyond argument parsing. No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, file access, or credential handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a CLI help interface with stylistic enhancements and no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
