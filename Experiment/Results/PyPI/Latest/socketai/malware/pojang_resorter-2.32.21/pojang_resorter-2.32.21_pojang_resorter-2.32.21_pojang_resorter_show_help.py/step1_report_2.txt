{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with a Python-Mojang interaction tool, displaying help information with ASCII art and colored formatting.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line arguments via argparse.",
  "sinks": "Output occurs through printing to stdout, including ASCII art, color codes, and help text.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line args) → argparse parsing → display of ASCII art and help information.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of ASCII art and color codes is solely for presentation. No external data fetching, network activity, or environment variable misuse detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a command-line parser with multiple subcommands and displays ASCII art with colored headers. It reads user input from sys.argv (via argparse), then prints visual information to stdout. No data is fetched or sent externally, and there are no dynamic or unsafe code execution parts. The code appears straightforward and primarily focused on UI presentation without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help display with ASCII art and colored text. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
