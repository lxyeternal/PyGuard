  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal, only defining metadata and importing a main function.\n- No data flows, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The code appears to be a standard package entry point or __init__.py file.\n\n**Confirming issues in the code:**\n- The code provided matches the descriptions: it only imports a function and sets metadata.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident in the code snippet.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- No logical errors or overestimations are apparent.\n- The only minor point is the confidence level in report 5 being slightly below 1, which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- Since all reports conclude no malicious or suspicious activity, there's no justification for higher risk scores.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is correct given the code's simplicity.\n- No malicious intent or behavior is detected or inferred.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that minimal import and metadata are safe, which is reasonable.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made without evidence.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0**  \n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard package entry point, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. All evidence supports a benign classification.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No further action or concern is necessary.",
