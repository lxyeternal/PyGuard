  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, mainly importing the main function and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points, especially untrusted data outputs, are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only imports a function and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal package module defining metadata and importing a main function. There is no data input, no execution of dynamic code, and no network or system calls. The import statement appears straightforward, importing from a relative module, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The version and author metadata are standard and do not pose any security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign package initialization file with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
