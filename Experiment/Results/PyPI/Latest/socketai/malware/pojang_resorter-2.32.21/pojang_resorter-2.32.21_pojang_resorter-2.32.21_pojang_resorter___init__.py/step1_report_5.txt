  "purpose": "Provides the core entry point for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool by importing main function and setting metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports the main function from the local module .main",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow or input/output handling present in the code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious or unusual behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports the main function from a local module. There are no data inputs, external network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or entry point file. No signs of malicious activity or malicious intent are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard package initialization script with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
