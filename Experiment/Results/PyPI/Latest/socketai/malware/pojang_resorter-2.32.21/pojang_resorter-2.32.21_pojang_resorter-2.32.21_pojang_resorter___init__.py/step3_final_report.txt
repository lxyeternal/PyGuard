{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal package module, providing metadata and importing a main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports a local module (.main).",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or external data handling points in the code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static metadata definitions and a relative import to the module's initialization, with no data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package entry point, defining version and author metadata, and importing a main function from a local module. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data flows involving untrusted sources. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or similar. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minimal nature and static content support a benign classification. The confidence in this assessment is high, and scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization file with no malicious intent or security issues. All signals point to a safe, straightforward implementation, and the scores reflect this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
