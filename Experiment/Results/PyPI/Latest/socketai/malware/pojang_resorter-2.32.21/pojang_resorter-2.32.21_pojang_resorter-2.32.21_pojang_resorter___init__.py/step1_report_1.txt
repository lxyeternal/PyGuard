  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns; only metadata and import",
  "analysis": "The code only sets version and author metadata, and imports a main function from a local module. There are no runtime data processing, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. The structure is minimal and standard for a CLI package's entry point, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, serving as an entry point for a CLI package with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
