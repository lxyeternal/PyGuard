  "purpose": "A CLI tool to execute predefined Python scripts based on command-line input, primarily for managing or interacting with a server or system.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument parsing via argparse; reading command input from user.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() to execute other Python scripts; reading command input which influences script execution.",
  "flows": "User input (command) → command mapping → script existence check → subprocess.run() execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of subprocess to invoke other scripts is standard but could be risky if script names or paths are manipulated, although the code checks for file existence. No obfuscated code, no suspicious external network calls, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up logging and defines a function to execute other scripts based on a command. It uses a command map to determine which script to run, constructs script paths, and executes them via subprocess.run(). It defaults to 'initialize_server' if no command is given. The use of subprocess to run scripts is standard, with proper existence checks, and no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The code appears to be a straightforward command dispatcher with logging and error handling, with no malicious or security-compromising features observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a command dispatcher for running specific Python scripts based on user input. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The use of subprocess is controlled, and no malicious activity or backdoors are evident. Overall, the script appears safe and legitimate.",
