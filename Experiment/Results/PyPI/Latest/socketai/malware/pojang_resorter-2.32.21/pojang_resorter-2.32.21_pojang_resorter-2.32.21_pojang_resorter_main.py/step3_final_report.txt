  "purpose": "A command-line interface tool that maps specific commands to corresponding Python scripts and executes them via subprocess.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsed by argparse; script existence checked via Path.exists()",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing external scripts based on user input",
  "flows": "Command input -> command map lookup -> script path verification -> subprocess.run() execution",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; controlled command set limits risk",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI dispatcher that restricts commands to a predefined set, verifies script existence, and executes scripts via subprocess. It does not process untrusted data beyond command selection, and error handling is in place. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. The main security concern is executing external scripts, which could be malicious if those scripts are compromised, but this is outside the scope of this code. The code's logic is sound, with proper validation and logging. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured command dispatcher with minimal inherent risk. The primary concern is external script trustworthiness, not the dispatcher itself. The existing scores are appropriate and justified.",
