  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface to execute specific Python scripts based on user commands, mainly for server initialization, snapshot preview, help display, and operator assignment.",
  "sources": "Input source: command-line argument ('command' argument from argparse).",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess to run other Python scripts ('subprocess.run'), logging errors, and printing error messages.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> 'execute_command_script' function -> 'subprocess.run' to execute scripts based on command mapping.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; command mapping appears straightforward. Use of subprocess to run other scripts is standard but could be misused if scripts are malicious. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code parses a command-line argument, defaults to 'initialize_server' if none provided, then maps the command to a script name. It attempts to execute the corresponding script using subprocess, catching and logging errors if the execution fails or the script does not exist. The script paths are constructed relative to the current script's directory. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage. Use of subprocess to run other scripts depends on external scripts, but no malicious patterns are evident here. The code's overall structure is typical for CLI utilities. No suspicious anomalies or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a command dispatcher that executes other scripts based on user input. It includes standard error handling and logging. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior within this code segment. Its use of subprocess to run other scripts is typical, and the code appears safe. Overall, the code appears to be benign, serving as a command wrapper with no malicious or security-compromising features.",
