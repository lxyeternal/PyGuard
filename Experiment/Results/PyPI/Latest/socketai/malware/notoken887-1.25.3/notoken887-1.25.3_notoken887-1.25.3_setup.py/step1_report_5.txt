  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of package metadata; no data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of suspicious email address 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org', which are inappropriate and potentially malicious or offensive; no actual malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic or malicious code. The package metadata includes a suspicious author email and URL, which could imply malicious intent or inappropriate content. There are no functions, input handling, or external data interactions. No obfuscated code or malware-like behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script itself is benign in terms of code execution but contains suspicious metadata (email and URL) that could indicate malicious intent or inappropriate content associated with the package. No malicious code or supply chain attack mechanisms are present.",
