  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static strings within setup() parameters: name, version, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Static metadata assigned directly to setup() parameters; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author_email ('hitler@gmail.com') and url ('https://thugging.org') are unprofessional and potentially malicious in intent but are static strings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with static metadata, no dynamic or malicious code present. The only notable anomalies are the unprofessional contact info, which could be used maliciously but do not constitute code-based threats. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The security risk score, reflecting metadata concerns, is moderate (around 0.3-0.4). The code itself is benign, and the metadata, while suspicious, does not impact technical security. The scores are consistent with the analysis and do not require adjustment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with suspicious metadata. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.3-0.4) are appropriate and consistent with the evidence.",
