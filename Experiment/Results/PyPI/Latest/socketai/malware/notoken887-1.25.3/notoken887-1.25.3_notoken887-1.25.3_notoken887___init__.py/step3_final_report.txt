{
  "purpose": "The code is a benign Python module performing data processing or utility functions with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or environment variables are exploited maliciously; code reads data internally or from benign sources.",
  "sinks": "No network connections, file writes, or system modifications indicative of malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows internally within the module; no untrusted data reaches sensitive sinks maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the absence of malicious patterns. The security risk score of 0.2 is slightly conservative but acceptable given limited context; it could be lowered to 0.1 for more benign assessments. Confidence levels are high (around 0.8-0.9), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present, and the overall assessment aligns with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious or obfuscated features. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. Minor adjustments to the security risk score could be considered, but current values are appropriate given the limited scope.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0,
