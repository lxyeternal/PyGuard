  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a Python module intended for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is not explicitly clear from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters and possibly environment variables or external modules, but no explicit input sources are shown in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network operations, file system access, or execution commands if present, but no such operations are evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "There are no apparent source-to-sink data flows in the visible code; the code mainly performs computations or data manipulations without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated segments are detected. No unusual imports or code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing with clear structure, using standard library functions. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity, are evident. The absence of external I/O operations or system calls further reduces suspicion. The overall structure and variable naming are conventional. Without additional context or hidden code, there are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected. The code appears benign, well-structured, and free of suspicious patterns.",
