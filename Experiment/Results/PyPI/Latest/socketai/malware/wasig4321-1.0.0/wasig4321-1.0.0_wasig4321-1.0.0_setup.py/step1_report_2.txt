{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation step to collect and transmit system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, username, OS type, and executes system commands to gather detailed hardware and network data depending on OS.",
  "sinks": "The collected system data is sent via an HTTP GET request to an external server (https://00ymg2fcpil5571bhtc00slwfnli98xx.oastify.com).",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system variables and subprocess command outputs, then sent unencrypted over the network to an external server as URL parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects detailed system information during installation and transmits it externally without user consent, which is unusual for a setup script. No use of hardcoded credentials or obfuscation is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the standard setuptools installation process with a custom command that, upon execution, gathers various system details based on the OS. It uses subprocess to execute system commands for Linux and Windows to collect hardware and network data. The collected information is then sent via an HTTP GET request to an external server. This behavior is atypical for a setup script, which normally does not transmit system info. The data collection and transmission occur silently during package installation, indicating potential malicious intent to perform system reconnaissance without user approval.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be malicious or at least maliciously deceptive, collecting detailed system data during installation and sending it to an external server without user consent. This behavior resembles malware designed for surveillance or data exfiltration, violating typical package installation norms.",
