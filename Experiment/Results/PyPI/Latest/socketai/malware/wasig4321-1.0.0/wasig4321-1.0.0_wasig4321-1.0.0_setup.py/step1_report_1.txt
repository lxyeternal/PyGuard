{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to gather system information during installation and send it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Input sources include system commands (hostname, platform info, IP configuration, CPU info, memory, disk, network info). Data is collected via subprocess.getoutput and system modules.",
  "sinks": "The external server request via requests.get with system info as URL parameters acts as the data exfiltration point.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered through command outputs, stored in 'cmds', then combined with hostname, cwd, username, os_info into 'ploads', which is sent via an HTTP GET request to the specified URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects extensive system details and immediately transmits them to an external domain during installation, which is suspicious. No user prompts or controls are present. The URL is suspiciously obfuscated with a non-descriptive domain. The 'requests.get' is used for data exfiltration without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the installation process to execute additional commands based on the OS, collecting sensitive system information such as IP addresses, CPU, memory, disk, and network details. It then sends this data to a remote server without user knowledge or consent. The use of subprocess to run system commands and the immediate transmission of data during install are common behaviors in malicious or privacy-invasive software. No other malicious actions like code injection, backdoors, or destructive behavior are evident. The code's intent appears to be stealthy data collection and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates malicious behavior by collecting detailed system information during package installation and sending it to an external server without user consent. The obfuscation of the target URL and the data exfiltration pattern suggest malicious intent, fitting a privacy invasion or reconnaissance activity. The overall security risk is high.",
