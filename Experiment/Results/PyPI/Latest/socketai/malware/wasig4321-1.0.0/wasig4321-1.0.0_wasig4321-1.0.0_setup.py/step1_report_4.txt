{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process of a Python package to collect system information and send it to an external server.",
  "sources": "System data collection includes socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), platform.system(), and subprocess.getoutput() calls for various system commands.",
  "sinks": "The external server request via requests.get() with system information as parameters, which transmits collected data over the network.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info collection) flow into the data payload, which is then sent via requests.get() to the external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Code collects detailed system information (including CPU, memory, disk, network info) without any user consent prompts or safeguards, and transmits it automatically during package installation. The target URL is suspicious, as it does not belong to a known service and resembles a temporary or potentially malicious domain. No authentication or encryption of data is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to run during package installation, collecting various system details depending on OS. It uses subprocess to execute OS commands, which can be sensitive and may cause privacy concerns. The data is then sent via an HTTP GET request to an external URL, potentially exposing sensitive system information. The code lacks any user notification, consent, or safeguards, indicating potential malicious intent for data exfiltration. The URL used is suspicious and possibly malicious. Overall, the code behaves in a way consistent with surreptitious data collection and exfiltration during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be malicious or at least highly suspicious, as it silently collects detailed system information and transmits it to an external server without user consent. The target URL is suspicious, and the behavior resembles a data exfiltration or surveillance activity embedded within a package installation process.",
