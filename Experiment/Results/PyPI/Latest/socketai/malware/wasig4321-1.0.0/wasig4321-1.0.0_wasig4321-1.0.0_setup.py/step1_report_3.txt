{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation command which collects system information and sends it to an external URL.",
  "sources": "System information commands (hostname, cwd, username, OS type, network info, CPU info, memory info, disk info), user inputs via environment variables and system commands.",
  "sinks": "Requests to an external URL with collected system data (via requests.get with params).",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system commands and environment variables, then sent over the network through an HTTP GET request to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects extensive system information during installation and exfiltrates it to an external server without any user consent or apparent purpose. No comments or documentation justify this behavior. The data collection and exfiltration are embedded within a package setup process, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script leverages setuptools to customize the installation process. During installation, it gathers detailed system information including hostname, current working directory, username, OS type, and hardware details via system commands. It then sends this data to an external server via an HTTP GET request. This behavior resembles malicious data exfiltration, especially since it occurs automatically during package installation without user awareness. The external URL is a potentially malicious or test endpoint, and the collection of system info suggests a privacy invasion or reconnaissance activity. The code does not include any obfuscation or apparent effort to conceal this behavior. No other malicious actions like code execution or data theft are evident, but the exfiltration is highly suspicious and not justified in a standard package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting detailed system information and sending it to an external server during installation, indicating a potential privacy violation or reconnaissance activity. This behavior is embedded within a package setup process, which is unusual and suspicious for legitimate software. Overall, the script poses a security threat due to unauthorized data exfiltration.",
