  "anomalies": "Unusual collection of detailed system information during package installation, sending data to an external server without user consent",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, collects detailed system information based on the OS type, including hostname, current directory, username, IP address, CPU info, memory, disk info, and network details. It then sends this data to an external URL via an HTTP GET request. The data collection occurs automatically during package installation, which is suspicious behavior because it compromises user privacy and security without explicit consent. The URL used appears to be a temporary or testing domain, possibly used for data exfiltration or reconnaissance. No other malicious actions or backdoors are present, but the behavior is intrusive and privacy-violating.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious or at least highly suspicious behavior by collecting extensive system details during installation and transmitting them to an external server without user approval. This behavior indicates potential privacy invasion or malicious intent. It should be considered dangerous for distribution or use.",
