{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the setup process to collect detailed system information during installation and exfiltrates it to an external URL without user consent, indicating malicious or spyware behavior.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), platform.system(), subprocess.getoutput() for system commands (hostname -I, wmic, ipconfig, etc.)",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to external URL with system info as parameters",
  "flows": "Data collected from system info sources flows into the 'ploads' dictionary, which is sent via requests.get() to the external server during the run() method of CustomInstall",
  "anomalies": "Silent collection and transmission of extensive system info during package installation without user consent; use of subprocess commands for hardware details; suspicious external URL; no user prompts or safeguards",
  "analysis": "The code performs malicious data exfiltration by collecting sensitive system information during package installation and sending it to an external server. It uses standard system commands and Python modules to gather hostname, current directory, username, OS type, and hardware/network details, then transmits this data via an HTTP GET request. The behavior is embedded within a custom install class, which executes during package setup, making it stealthy. The URL is suspicious and likely used for malicious purposes. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the malicious intent is clear due to the privacy-invasive data collection and exfiltration without user awareness. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8, security risk ~0.85, obfuscated 0) are justified given the behavior. The behavior aligns with malware or spyware activity, and the high scores reflect the severity of privacy invasion and potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by silently collecting and exfiltrating sensitive system information during package installation. The external URL and lack of user consent confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate, indicating high malware and security risk levels. This code should be flagged as malicious and removed from distribution to prevent privacy violations and potential harm.",
