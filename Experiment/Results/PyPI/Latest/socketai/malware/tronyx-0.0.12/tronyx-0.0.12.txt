      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk behavior by exfiltrating private keys over the network without safeguards. Although it does not contain explicit malicious code like backdoors or payloads, its behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The use of a set for data transmission is a bug but does not mitigate the security concern. The URLs are suspicious, and the plaintext transmission of sensitive data is a serious security flaw. The overall assessment indicates a high probability of malicious intent or severe security vulnerability."
