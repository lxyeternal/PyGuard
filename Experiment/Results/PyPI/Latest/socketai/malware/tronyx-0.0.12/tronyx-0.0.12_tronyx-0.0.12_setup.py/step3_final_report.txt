  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long_description, static package metadata, dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static data used only for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and conventional with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools and pathlib. It reads a local README.md for description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and repository URL. There are no dynamic or malicious operations, no user input, environment variables, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with consistent scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and high confidence. No issues or suspicious patterns are present. The only minor note is a comment about a comma, which is harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a standard, benign package configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
