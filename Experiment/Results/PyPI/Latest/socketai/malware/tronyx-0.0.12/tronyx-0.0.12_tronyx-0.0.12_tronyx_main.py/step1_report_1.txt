{
  "purpose": "The code appears to send transaction data, including a private key, to a remote server and fetches a switcher status, possibly for controlling behavior.",
  "sources": "The function reads input via the 'private_key' parameter; it also makes network requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "The private key is sent over a POST request; the response from a GET request is used in control flow.",
  "flows": "Input 'private_key' is included in 'transaction_data' which is sent via POST; then a GET request retrieves data used to decide the return value.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends sensitive private key data to an external server without encryption or obfuscation; the transaction data is stored in a set with a string containing the private key, which may lead to data leakage. The URL used appears suspicious and may be malicious or maliciously hosted.",
  "analysis": "The function 'perm' takes a private key as input, constructs a set with the key, and sends it to a remote URL via POST, which indicates potential leakage of sensitive credentials. The use of a set to store transaction data with a string containing the private key is unusual but not inherently malicious; however, sending private keys over network is highly suspicious and a security risk. The subsequent GET request fetches data to determine control flow, possibly for malicious purposes such as remote command and control. No obfuscated code or malicious code constructs are present. The URLs used are non-standard and could be malicious. Overall, the code exfiltrates private key data, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code leaks private key data to an external server, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. It may be part of a supply chain attack or malicious script designed to exfiltrate sensitive information. The code should be considered malicious with high confidence.",
