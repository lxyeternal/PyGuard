{
  "purpose": "Send transaction data containing a private key to an external API and check a switcher status from the same API.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'private_key', data read from the 'private_key' parameter.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending data to external API, requests.get() retrieving data from external API.",
  "flows": "The private_key is included in transaction_data and sent via POST request; GET request retrieves switcher status which influences the return value.",
  "anomalies": "The code stores the private_key in a set instead of a dictionary or JSON object, which is unconventional; the private_key is sent over the network, possibly exposing sensitive data; use of hardcoded URL indicates reliance on external endpoint; no encryption or authentication observed.",
  "analysis": "The function 'perm' takes a private_key as input, stores it in a set, then sends this set via POST to a remote URL, potentially exposing the private key. It also performs a GET request to the same domain to fetch switcher status. The data handling is insecure, as private credentials are transmitted unencrypted and unprotected. The use of a set to store transaction data is unusual and may not serialize as expected. The code's behavior could be malicious if the external API is controlled by an attacker or if the private key is used maliciously. There is no input validation, encryption, or authentication, raising security concerns. Overall, the code appears to send sensitive data externally without safeguards, indicating a high risk of malicious data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code poses a significant security risk by transmitting a private key over the network to an external endpoint without encryption or validation. It does not contain malicious code per se but implements insecure data handling practices that could facilitate credential theft or data leakage, implying a high security threat level.",
