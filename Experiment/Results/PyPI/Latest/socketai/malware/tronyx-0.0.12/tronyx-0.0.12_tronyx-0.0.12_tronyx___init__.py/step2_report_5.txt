  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward relative import statement: `from .main import perm`.\n   - There are no indications of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or network activity.\n   - The code is minimal and standard for Python modules.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are identified in any report.\n   - The import statement is syntactically correct and typical in Python projects.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n3. **Score Justification:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1), consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities in this isolated import.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent solely based on an import statement.\n   - No false positives or unwarranted suspicion are evident.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis: benign code, no malware, minimal security risk.\n   - The slight variation in confidence (0.7 to 1.0) reflects the limited context but does not impact the overall benign assessment.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very minimal, due to the general nature of the import statement, but not risky)\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- The minimal security risk is appropriate, considering the context is only an import statement.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The import statement is standard, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
