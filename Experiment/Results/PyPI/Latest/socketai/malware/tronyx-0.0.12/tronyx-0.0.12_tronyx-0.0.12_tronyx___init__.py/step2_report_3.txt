  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a single import statement: `from .main import perm`.\n- The import is from a local module named `main`.\n- The reports consistently conclude that this code is benign, standard, and poses no security risk.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The import statement is present in all reports, matching the original code.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence or suspicion of malicious behavior in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Data flow / sinks:** None; the code only imports, with no data processing.\n\n### Flaws or logical errors:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the simplicity of the code.\n- They correctly identify that the snippet alone does not indicate malicious activity.\n- No false positives or overestimations are apparent.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is reasonable for a simple import statement.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The risk scores are very low, reflecting the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n- The slight security risk (0.1) in some reports could be justified if considering the potential for malicious `main.py` content, but as a standalone snippet, the risk is negligible.\n- Malware score remains 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **The code is a standard relative import statement** with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **The scores assigned are reasonable** and consistent with the analysis.\n- **No changes are necessary** based on the information provided.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, considering only the import statement; higher scores would require additional context or evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:** The code snippet is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
