  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from a module named 'main' within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'main' module from the local package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is being processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The import statement only loads 'perm' from 'main', no data flow or processing occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any unusual or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are present.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple relative import statement, common in Python packages, to include 'perm' from a sibling module named 'main'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues in this single line. The code does not perform any operations or contain any suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no indication of malicious activity or security risks. The code appears benign and standard for modular Python projects.",
