  "purpose": "Evaluate the benign import statement 'from .main import perm' for potential security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module 'main' and imports 'perm'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only performs a static import without data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'perm' from the local 'main' module; no data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement with no malicious indicators, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0. Security risk scores are minimal (0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the code's simplicity. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforwardness of the code. No anomalies or malicious activity are present, and the scores are consistent with the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, poses no security threat, and is standard in Python modules. The scores across reports are appropriate; the overall risk is negligible. To better reflect the benign nature, the security risk score can be set to 0 in all reports.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
