  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward relative import statement:\n     ```python\n     from .main import perm\n     ```\n   - There are no indications of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior within this line.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and standard for Python modules.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the minimal nature of the code and its benign intent.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - **Note:** The reports tend to assign very high confidence scores (mostly 1.0), which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n3. **Scores Review and Suggestions:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with a few reports giving 0.1, which is acceptable given the minimal context.\n   - **Confidence Scores:** Generally high (1.0), which is justified.\n   - **Recommendation:** No changes needed; scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity, a higher risk score would be unjustified.\n   - **Conclusion:** Risk scores are appropriately low.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not seem to make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis.\n   - The minimal code and benign analysis justify the low scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.1 at most, but generally 0)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThis import statement is a common, benign pattern in Python modules. Without additional context or code, there is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard relative import.\n- No malicious activity or security issues are present.\n- Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n- No adjustments necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** The code is safe; the scores reflect that accurately.",
