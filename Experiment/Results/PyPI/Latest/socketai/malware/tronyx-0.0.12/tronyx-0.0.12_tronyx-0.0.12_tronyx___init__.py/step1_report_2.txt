  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement itself, which reads from a local module file 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable beyond the import statement; it simply makes 'perm' available in the current scope.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. The import is from a relative module, which is standard in Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'perm' from a local module named 'main', indicating dependency on a local file. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or network activity. The snippet is too small to assess further behavior or intent. No anomalies or obfuscation are detected. Since this is just an import statement, there is no malicious activity present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple import from a local module with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The minimal nature of the code does not suggest any malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
