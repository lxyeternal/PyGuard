  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'main' when executed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present in this line.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink path evident in this line.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code, no anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply performs a relative import of 'perm' from the 'main' module within the same package. This is a standard import statement used in Python packages for modular code organization. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The import itself does not pose security risks; further analysis of 'main.py' would be required to evaluate overall security, but this line alone is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns identified in this snippet.",
