      "conclusion": "The code's behavior of executing 'main()' during setup poses a significant supply chain security risk. The existing reports correctly identify this pattern, and the scores should be adjusted upward to reflect the high potential for malicious activity if 'main.py' is untrusted. The overall risk is high, and this pattern warrants caution and further review of 'main.py'."

      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data exfiltration script communicating with suspicious domains. While it lacks malicious payloads like system damage or backdoors, its behavior indicates malicious intent for covert data collection. The high malware and risk scores are justified given the suspicious URLs and exfiltration pattern."
