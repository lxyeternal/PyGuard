  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to external URLs with system info as parameters",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory) -> URL parameters -> HTTP GET request to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Sending system information to suspicious domains; usage of random number as a URL parameter; multiple external URLs that appear suspicious and are obfuscated or non-standard; no user consent or indication of purpose; data exfiltration behavior",
  "analysis": "The script gathers basic system info: hostname, username, current working directory, and a random number. It then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious or untrusted domains and sends an HTTP request to each with these details embedded as URL parameters. The URLs are not standard or legitimate domains and appear to be malicious or part of a tracking/data collection scheme. The code does not include any user prompt or clear purpose, and the data sent could be used for profiling or unauthorized data collection. The usage of try-except ensures the code continues execution despite network failures, which is common in malicious data exfiltration scripts. Overall, the code behaves like a tracking or data exfiltration payload, with no benign purpose evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting system info and transmitting it to untrusted, suspicious domains. It appears designed for malicious data collection or tracking, with no transparent user intent. The overall security risk is high.",
