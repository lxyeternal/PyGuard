  "purpose": "Collects system information (hostname, username, current directory) and sends it to multiple remote URLs, possibly for tracking or surveillance purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system information such as hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP GET requests to external URLs using urllib.request.urlopen, transmitting system info and a random number as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Collects system info (source) → Constructs URL with parameters → Sends HTTP request to external server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple suspicious domains that are not standard, combines system data with a random number, and transmits this data without user consent or clear purpose. The URLs appear to be obfuscated or suspicious. No user input is directly used, but the data exfiltration pattern is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, current directory, and a random number, then constructs URLs targeting suspicious domains. It attempts to send this data to these domains via HTTP GET requests, logging responses or errors. The purpose appears to be to track or gather system info covertly. The URLs used are non-standard and potentially malicious. No malicious code (e.g., backdoors, data theft beyond info collection) is directly embedded, but the data exfiltration pattern and suspicious domains indicate malicious intent or surveillance. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting system info and sending it to unknown external domains, likely for tracking or data exfiltration purposes. The presence of suspicious URLs and data transmission without user awareness raises security concerns. It does not contain obfuscation or malware like system damage or backdoors, but the activity pattern suggests malicious surveillance.",
