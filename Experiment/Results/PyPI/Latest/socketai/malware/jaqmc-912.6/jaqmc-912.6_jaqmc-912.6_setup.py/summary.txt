  "conclusion": "The code's behavior of executing 'main()' during setup poses a significant supply chain security risk. The existing reports correctly identify this pattern, and the scores should be adjusted upward to reflect the high potential for malicious activity if 'main.py' is untrusted. The overall risk is high, and this pattern warrants caution and further review of 'main.py'."
