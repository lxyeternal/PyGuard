{
  "purpose": "The setup script is used to configure and install the 'jaqmc' Python package, including a custom installation step that executes code from 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules (setuptools, main), and during installation, executes 'main()' from 'main'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during install could run arbitrary code, depending on its contents.",
  "flows": "The install process calls 'main()' from 'main', which could execute arbitrary or malicious code if 'main' contains such logic.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install command runs 'main()' without any apparent validation, which is unusual for setup scripts. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools for package configuration, which is standard. However, it overrides the 'install' command to run 'main()' from a local module during installation. If 'main()' contains malicious code, it will execute during the package installation process, potentially compromising the host system. The rest of the script appears typical for a Python package setup, with no other suspicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk is concentrated in the execution of 'main()' during install, which is a common tactic to execute arbitrary code.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard setup procedure but includes a potentially malicious or undesirable behavior by executing 'main()' during installation. If 'main()' contains malicious code, it could harm the host system during package installation. This behavior should be scrutinized further to verify the contents of 'main'.",
