{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'jaqmc' with a custom installation step that executes a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "Importing 'main' and calling 'main()' inside the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of main() could lead to execution of arbitrary code, depending on the content of main.py.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code executes 'main()' from main.py, which could execute arbitrary or malicious code if main.py is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class runs 'main()' after installation without any validation or restrictions, which is unusual for a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses setuptools to define the package. The custom class CrazyInstallStrat extends the install command to call 'main()' from main.py after installation completes. This behavior can be used maliciously if main.py contains malicious code, as it executes unconditionally during installation. The code does not sanitize or verify the content of main.py, making this a potential security risk. The code itself appears structurally normal for a setup script but contains an unusual and potentially malicious behavior by executing code upon installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical setup task but includes a suspicious behavior: executing 'main()' from main.py during installation without validation. This could be exploited to run malicious code when the package is installed. The pattern is atypical and warrants caution, indicating a possible supply chain risk.",
