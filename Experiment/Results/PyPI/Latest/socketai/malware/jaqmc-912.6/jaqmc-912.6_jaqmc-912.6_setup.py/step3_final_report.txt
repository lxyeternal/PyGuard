{
  "purpose": "The code executes the 'main()' function from 'main.py' during installation, which is an unconventional and potentially risky behavior in setup scripts.",
  "sources": "Importing 'main' from 'main.py' and executing 'main()' during the install process.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during setup, which can run arbitrary code if 'main.py' contains malicious content.",
  "flows": "Setup process → import 'main' → execute 'main()' during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external code ('main()') during setup without validation or sandboxing.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that, after completing the standard installation, imports and runs 'main()' from 'main.py'. This pattern introduces a supply chain security risk, as it executes external code during package installation. The code itself is straightforward and not obfuscated, but executing external code without validation can lead to malicious activity if 'main.py' is compromised. The reports correctly identify this behavior and assign malware scores ranging from 0.25 to 0.75, reflecting varying degrees of suspicion. Given the potential for malicious code execution, a higher malware score (~0.75) and security risk (~0.75) are justified, especially if the source of 'main.py' is untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code's behavior of executing 'main()' during setup poses a significant supply chain security risk. The existing reports correctly identify this pattern, and the scores should be adjusted upward to reflect the high potential for malicious activity if 'main.py' is untrusted. The overall risk is high, and this pattern warrants caution and further review of 'main.py'.",
