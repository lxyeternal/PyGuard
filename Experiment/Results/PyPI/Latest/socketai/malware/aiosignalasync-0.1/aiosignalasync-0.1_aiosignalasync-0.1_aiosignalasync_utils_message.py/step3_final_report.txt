  "purpose": "Display a fake error message window using Windows API with configurable message and title.",
  "sources": "Message content and title retrieved from MessageConfig object.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted externally.",
  "flows": "MessageConfig provides data to windll.user32.MessageBoxW, which displays the message box.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling silently ignores errors; no obfuscation or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly displays a Windows message box with configurable text, using standard API calls. It does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The external MessageConfig supplies static strings. Exception handling suppresses errors but does not conceal malicious activity. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's purpose appears benign, intended for user notification or prank. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with its benign nature, acknowledging potential misuse in social engineering but no inherent security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for displaying configurable fake error messages, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. Its potential for misuse in social engineering justifies a low security risk score of 0.2. The malware score remains at 0, as no malicious behavior is detected.",
