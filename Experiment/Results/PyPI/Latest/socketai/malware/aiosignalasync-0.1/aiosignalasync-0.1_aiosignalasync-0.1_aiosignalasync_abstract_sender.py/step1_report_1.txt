{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract template class for a data sender, including SSL configuration and abstract methods for data retrieval and transmission.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (`asyncspeedtest.helpers.config`, `asyncspeedtest.helpers`) and class methods accessing instance variables.",
  "sinks": "None directly present in the provided code; no data output, external communication, or untrusted data handling shown.",
  "flows": "Initialization of instance variables, call to `ssl._create_unverified_https()`, invocation of abstract methods (`__get_sender_data`, `__send_archive`, `run`).",
  "anomalies": "The `_create_unverified_https()` method disables SSL verification, which can be exploited if misused, but is a common practice in testing environments. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an abstract class with protected and abstract methods for data handling and transmission. It imports standard modules and custom helpers. The `_create_unverified_https()` method disables SSL certificate validation, which might be risky if used improperly, but is explicitly documented. No suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent. The use of abstract methods suggests this is a template meant to be extended; no active data flows or external network operations are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard template for a data sender, with a potentially risky SSL setting disabled for unverified HTTPS connections. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage in this fragment.",
