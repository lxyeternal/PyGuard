{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for a sender module used to transmit data, with SSL verification control.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the data parameter in run() method; configuration from SenderConfig; potentially external modules providing data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the __send_archive() method when implemented; data output depends on subclass implementation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from run() parameters to internal storage (__zip_name, __data, __preview), then through __send_archive() for transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; use of ssl._create_default_https_context to disable SSL verification could be considered a security risk if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with methods for data handling and transmission. It includes disabling SSL verification via _create_unverified_https, which can be risky but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present. The class serves as a template, and actual behavior depends on subclass implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract class template for data sending. The only notable point is the SSL verification disabling method, which could be misused but is not malicious by itself. No malware or malicious behavior is evident.",
