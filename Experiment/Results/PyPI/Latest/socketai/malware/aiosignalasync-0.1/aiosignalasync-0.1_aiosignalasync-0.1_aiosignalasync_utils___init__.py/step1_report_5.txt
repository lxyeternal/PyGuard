{
  "purpose": "This code is defining an API or module interface by importing several classes and making them available for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external data inputs, or sensitive data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly module imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports classes from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. There are no function calls, data processing, or external communications. The structure indicates a straightforward module setup without any malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. All components are presumably part of a larger project, but nothing in this snippet indicates malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module interface setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only manages imports and exports, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security concerns.",
