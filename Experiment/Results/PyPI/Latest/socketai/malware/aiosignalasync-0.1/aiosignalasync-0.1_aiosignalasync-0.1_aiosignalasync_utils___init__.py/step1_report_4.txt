{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes from submodules and defines an export list for these classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current package directory, importing modules named autostart, message, loader, protector, and grabber.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported modules into the current namespace; however, no untrusted data sources or sinks are evident here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from sibling modules within the package and defines an explicit __all__ list for export. No malicious or suspicious behavior is visible in this fragment. It lacks any input handling, data processing, or external communication. Since this is a simple import/export structure, it does not contain any security risks or malware indicators based solely on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import/export pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and appears to be part of a larger application structure.",
