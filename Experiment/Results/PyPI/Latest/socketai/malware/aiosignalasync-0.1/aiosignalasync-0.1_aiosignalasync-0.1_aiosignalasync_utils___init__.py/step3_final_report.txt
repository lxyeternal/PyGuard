{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or index file, importing specific classes from local modules and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing classes from local modules and exposing them; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import and export setup typical for a Python package's __init__.py. It contains no dynamic behavior, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this snippet, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. Given the absence of suspicious elements, the code is considered safe, and no modifications to the scores are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initializer with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and risk approximately 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
