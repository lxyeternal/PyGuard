{
  "purpose": "The code is a module that imports specific classes from local modules and defines an export list for a package or larger codebase.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow endpoints present; no external network, file, or system interactions",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "This code only performs import statements and defines an __all__ list for module exports. It does not process data, execute logic, or interact with external systems. The imported modules' content could contain malicious code, but from this fragment alone, there are no indicators of malicious intent. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or similar setup, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import/export setup with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no apparent security issues or malicious activities within this snippet.",
