{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'aiosignalasync' to facilitate its installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'setuptools' modules and uses 'find_packages()' to automatically discover packages in the directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output sinks present in this script.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script merely defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'aiosignalasync' is unusual and could potentially be a typo or an obfuscated name, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. The code itself is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It imports 'setuptools' modules, defines package metadata (name and version), and uses 'find_packages()' to include all packages in the current directory. There are no sources of untrusted input, no sinks that could leak data, and no anomalous or suspicious code patterns such as obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious functions. The simplicity and common pattern suggest no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious behavior detected. The package name appears unusual but does not indicate malicious activity. Overall, it presents no security risks.",
