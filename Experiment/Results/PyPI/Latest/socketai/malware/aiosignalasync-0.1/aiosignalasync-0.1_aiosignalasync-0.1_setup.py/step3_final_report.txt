  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and discovering sub-packages.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools (`setup`, `find_packages`) and the call to `setup()` with package name, version, and package discovery.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no external data handling.",
  "flows": "Import statements lead to `setup()` invocation, which uses static metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual package name `aiosignalasync`, but no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard `setup.py` script with no dynamic code, user input, or external data. The package name is unusual but not malicious. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation are detected. The package name alone does not imply malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. The package name's unusual nature does not indicate malicious intent. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
