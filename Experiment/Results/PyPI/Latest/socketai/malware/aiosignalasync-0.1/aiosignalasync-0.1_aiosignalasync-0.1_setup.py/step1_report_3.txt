  "purpose": "Define and configure the package setup for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it primarily defines package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions with untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets up package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; the package name 'aiosignalasync' is a straightforward name, and no secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and uses 'setup()' to configure the package with a name, version, and packages list. There is no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, and no malicious patterns identified. The package name appears to be a standard package name, and the setup configuration is minimal and typical for Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs basic package configuration without any suspicious activity.",
