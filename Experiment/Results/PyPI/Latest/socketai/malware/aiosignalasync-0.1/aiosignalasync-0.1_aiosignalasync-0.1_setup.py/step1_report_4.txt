{
  "purpose": "The code is used to configure and set up a Python package named 'aiosignalasync' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the call to find_packages() to identify package directories, and from the parameters provided to setup() such as name and version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; setup() is used for packaging and does not involve data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The setup() function consolidates package information; no data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present. The code is minimal and standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools components and calls setup() with basic package information. It uses find_packages() to automatically include all packages in the directory. There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no external data sources or sinks. The code appears to be a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. No signs of malicious activity or security issues are present.",
