  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'aiosignalasync'.",
  "sources": "The package's own setup() function parameters, such as name, version, and packages.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks; standard packaging call.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; straightforward setup invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual patterns or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script using setuptools to define package metadata. It imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, then calls setup() with basic parameters. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no code injection, or suspicious operations. The script performs a standard package configuration without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
