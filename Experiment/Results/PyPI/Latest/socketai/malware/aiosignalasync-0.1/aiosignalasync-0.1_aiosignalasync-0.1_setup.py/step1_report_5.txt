  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'aiosignalasync' Python package.",
  "sources": "The 'setup.py' reads package metadata and uses 'find_packages()' to locate package modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external connections present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script only initializes package setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard, and does not contain suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, defines minimal package metadata, and uses 'find_packages()' to include all sub-packages. There are no user inputs, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors. The structure is typical for a setup script and does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward and benign setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
