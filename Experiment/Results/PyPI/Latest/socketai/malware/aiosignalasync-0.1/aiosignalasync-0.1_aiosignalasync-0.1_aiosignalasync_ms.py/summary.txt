  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, primarily through embedded credentials, data exfiltration mechanisms, and insecure SSL handling. While no obfuscation or explicit malware payload is present, the overall behavior suggests malicious activity. The malware score is set high, and the security risk is correspondingly elevated, warranting caution and further review."
