{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for extensive data collection from system, browsers, and applications, and transmits the gathered data via Telegram, potentially for malicious exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded Telegram token, platform info, configuration objects, environment variables, and module data inputs.",
  "sinks": "Data sent over network via Telegram, stored temporarily in memory, compressed into ZIP files, and possibly executed or processed further.",
  "flows": "Data flows from modules and environment sources into memory/storage, then into ZIP files and transmission channels, with process initiation and exception handling in place.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded Telegram token and user ID, SSL context overridden to disable verification (`ssl._create_unverified_context`), silent exception handling suppressing errors, no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs broad data collection, including browser and system info, and transmits it via Telegram using hardcoded credentials. The SSL bypass and silent error handling facilitate covert operation. No obfuscation or encryption is present, but the behavior aligns with data exfiltration malware. The embedded credentials and insecure network handling are significant security concerns, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, primarily through embedded credentials, data exfiltration mechanisms, and insecure SSL handling. While no obfuscation or explicit malware payload is present, the overall behavior suggests malicious activity. The malware score is set high, and the security risk is correspondingly elevated, warranting caution and further review.",
