  "purpose": "Defines and exports the AbstractSender class for module use",
  "sources": "The import statement from .sender import AbstractSender",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; minimal code with import and export",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports AbstractSender from a local module and exposes it via __all__. It contains no runtime logic, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. The import is a relative import, which is standard. There are no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, standard, and lacks any malicious behavior or security issues. It functions as a simple module export statement.",
