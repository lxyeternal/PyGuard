  "purpose": "A minimal module that imports a class and re-exports it for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module (.sender).",
  "sinks": "None; no external communication or data handling.",
  "flows": "Import source to module namespace, then to __all__ export.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward re-export pattern with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and exposes it via __all__, serving as a simple export interface. No data processing, external communication, or malicious patterns are present. The code is structurally benign, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or anomalies. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning high confidence and zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The simplicity and lack of suspicious activity justify these scores. No logical errors or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics. No further action or concern is warranted.",
