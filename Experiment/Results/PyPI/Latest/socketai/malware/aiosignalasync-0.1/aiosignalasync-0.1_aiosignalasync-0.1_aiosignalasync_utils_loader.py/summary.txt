  "conclusion": "The code itself is not inherently malicious but facilitates malicious activity if misused, especially in supply chain scenarios. Its ability to silently download and execute arbitrary files with no validation or safeguards makes it high risk. The overall potential for abuse warrants a high malware score and security risk score."
