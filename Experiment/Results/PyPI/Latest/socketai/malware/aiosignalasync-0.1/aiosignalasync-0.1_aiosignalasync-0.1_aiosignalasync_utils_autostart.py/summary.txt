  "conclusion": "The code is not inherently malicious but can be exploited for malicious persistence due to its actions and potential command injection vulnerability. The current scores of malware (~0.2–0.3) and security risk (~0.5–0.6) are appropriate, though the risk could be slightly higher if considering the command injection potential. Proper input validation and avoiding shell=True would mitigate these risks."
