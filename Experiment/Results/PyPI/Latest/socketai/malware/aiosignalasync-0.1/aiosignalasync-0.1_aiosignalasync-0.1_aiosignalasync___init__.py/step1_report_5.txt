{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a package's __init__.py file, defining what components are exported for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .ms, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident; no untrusted data handling or processing occurs in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; mainly imports and __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious constructs, or obfuscated code; only standard import statements and __all__ list",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes or functions from internal modules and defines an export list. It does not execute any logic, handle external input, or perform actions that could pose security risks. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. The code structure suggests a typical package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not perform any insecure operations or contain malware indicators.",
