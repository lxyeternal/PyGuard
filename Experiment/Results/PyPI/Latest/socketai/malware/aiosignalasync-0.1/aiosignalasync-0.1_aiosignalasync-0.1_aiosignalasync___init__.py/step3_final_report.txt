  "purpose": "Module initialization and API exposure via import statements and __all__ declaration.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.ms, .enums, .utils).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import sources to __all__ export list; no runtime data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes and enums from internal modules and declares __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and minimal security risk scores (~0.1), which are justified by dependency trust considerations. The code's security posture depends on the imported modules, but the snippet itself is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python package interface module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The minimal risk score reflects dependency trust rather than code behavior. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
