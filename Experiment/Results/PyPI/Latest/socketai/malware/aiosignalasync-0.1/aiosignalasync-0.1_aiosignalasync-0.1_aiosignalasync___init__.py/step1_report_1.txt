{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define the public interface of a Python package by importing specific classes and enumerations from internal modules and exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from local modules: .ms, .enums, and .utils, importing classes and enums such as Compute, Senders, Features, Utils, Protectors, Loader, and Grabber.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this snippet. No untrusted data handling, network connections, or data processing occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are visible; this code only imports and declares exports without processing or transferring data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are evident. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package structure.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports modules and makes specific classes and enums available for external use. It does not perform any data processing, I/O, or security-sensitive operations. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code adheres to common Python package practices.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this limited code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions as a typical module interface declaration.",
