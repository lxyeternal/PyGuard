      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation to a suspicious external server. The behavior is consistent, straightforward, and without obfuscation. The high malware and security risk scores are justified and appropriate. The package should be flagged as malicious, and users should avoid installing it."
