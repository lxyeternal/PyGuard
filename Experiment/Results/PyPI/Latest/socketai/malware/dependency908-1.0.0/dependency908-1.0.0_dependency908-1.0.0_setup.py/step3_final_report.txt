  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system information (hostname, current directory, username) during package installation by sending it to a suspicious external URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call sending data to external server",
  "flows": "source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> requests.get() with data as parameters",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration during installation without user notification; use of suspicious URL; straightforward code with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon execution, collects system info and transmits it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL. The behavior occurs silently during package installation, indicating malicious intent. The URL is suspicious, and no user consent is obtained. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but performs covert data exfiltration. The high malware and security risk scores are justified due to the malicious behavior, which could facilitate privacy violations or further malicious activities. The scores are consistent across reports, with confidence at 0.9. No logical errors or false positives are present; the behavior is clearly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation to a suspicious external server. The behavior is consistent, straightforward, and without obfuscation. The high malware and security risk scores are justified and appropriate. The package should be flagged as malicious, and users should avoid installing it.",
