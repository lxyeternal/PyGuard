{
  "purpose": "To customize the installation process by sending system information to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() — these read system hostname, current working directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() — sends data to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, cwd, username) feed into the 'ploads' dictionary, which is then sent via requests.get to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during installation without user consent; the target URL appears suspicious and likely malicious. No validation or user notification. The URL is hardcoded and potentially malicious, indicative of data collection or backdoor behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command for setuptools that, upon installation, gathers system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and sends this data to an external server. The URL used is suspicious and resembles a command-and-control or malicious server. The data transmission occurs silently during package installation without user awareness, which is a malicious behavior. The code uses standard library functions and third-party requests library, which are common but exploited here for malicious data exfiltration. No other malicious actions such as executing commands or downloading malware are present. The pattern indicates intentional covert data collection intended for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious data exfiltration during package installation, likely for tracking or unauthorized surveillance. The presence of a suspicious external URL and silent operation strongly suggest malicious intent. This package should be considered malicious and not used.",
