{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process with a custom installation step that collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, current working directory, and username from environment and system calls; makes an HTTP GET request to an external server.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call that transmits system information over the network to a potentially malicious server.",
  "flows": "During installation, gathers hostname, cwd, and username, then sends this data via HTTP GET request to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration without user consent during package installation; the remote URL is suspicious and indicates potential malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script with a custom install command. During installation, it collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this information via an HTTP request to an external domain. This behavior occurs silently during package installation, indicating potential malicious intent such as data exfiltration or surveillance. No other suspicious or obfuscated code is present; the code is straightforward but malicious in intent due to the unauthorized data transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior—specifically, data exfiltration of system information during package installation without user consent. The code's primary intent appears to be covert data collection, which constitutes a security threat.",
