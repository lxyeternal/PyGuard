  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process with a custom installation step that sends system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with external URL and parameters",
  "flows": "Collect system info (hostname, cwd, username) -> send via HTTP GET request to remote server",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits system hostname, current directory, and username to an external server during installation without user consent, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The URL used is suspicious and indicates possible command and control or data exfiltration behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration with a custom install command that, upon execution, gathers system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username. Instead of just installing, it makes an HTTP GET request to a remote server (gj8fxybp.requestrepo.com) passing this information as URL parameters. This behavior occurs during installation, which is atypical and could be used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration, tracking, or establishing unauthorized communication. The URL appears suspicious, and the lack of user notification or configuration options raises concerns about stealthy behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious-like behavior by sending system info to an external server during package installation. The URL and data collection methods are indicative of potential data exfiltration or malicious control channel. This code should be treated as malicious or compromised, and the package should not be trusted.",
