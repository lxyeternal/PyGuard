{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that performs custom installation behavior, specifically collecting system information and sending it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username using socket, os, and getpass modules.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function sends collected data to an external URL, potentially leaking system info to an external server.",
  "flows": "Data collected from socket, os, and getpass modules flows into the requests.get() call as URL parameters, transmitting system info to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an unsolicited network request during package installation without user consent, sending system details to an external domain. No validation or user notification is present. The URL used appears suspicious and is a custom domain possibly used for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and additional modules. It defines a custom install class overriding the run method. In this method, it gathers system information: hostname via socket.gethostname(), current directory via os.getcwd(), and username via getpass.getuser(). These are stored in a dictionary 'ploads'. The script then makes a GET request to a remote domain with these details as URL parameters. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious, as it leaks system info without user awareness or consent. The URL used is non-standard and potentially malicious, designed to collect user data surreptitiously. The code does not contain any obfuscation or encryption, making its malicious intent straightforward to detect.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation to an external server without user consent. The behavior suggests possible surveillance or data collection intended for malicious or tracking purposes. The overall risk is high due to the covert data transmission, warranting caution and potential blocking of this package.",
