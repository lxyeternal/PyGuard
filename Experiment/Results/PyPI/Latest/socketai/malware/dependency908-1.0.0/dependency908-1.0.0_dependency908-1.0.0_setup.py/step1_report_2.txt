{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, upon installation, collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during the CustomInstall run method.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends collected data to a remote server at 'http://gj8fxybp.requestrepo.com'.",
  "flows": "The code flows from collecting hostname, cwd, username (sources) during installation, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request (sink) to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an unusual network request during installation, which is suspicious. The URL used for data exfiltration appears malicious or suspicious. No authentication or encryption is present for the data transmission. The URL is non-standard and appears to be used for covert data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script leverages setuptools to define package installation behavior. During installation, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this information to an external URL. The network request occurs during the install command, which is unusual and potentially malicious, especially given the context of data exfiltration. The URL used looks suspicious and potentially malicious. No user consent or indication is provided, and the collected data could be used for malicious tracking or reconnaissance. There are no obfuscation techniques or malware signatures, but the behavior itself is suspicious due to data exfiltration at install time.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation to an external server. This is typical of malicious supply chain attacks or backdoors embedded in legitimate-looking setup scripts. It should be considered malicious and should not be used.",
