{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to encode Ethereum messages according to standards like EIP-191, EIP-712, and defunct methods, for signing and hashing.",
  "sources": "Address validation, data conversion (to_bytes, to_text), structured data validation, and message components (version, header, body).",
  "sinks": "Hashing functions (keccak), validation functions, and creation of SignableMessage objects.",
  "flows": "Input data (addresses, structured data, primitive messages) are validated and converted, then assembled into SignableMessage objects, which are hashed to produce signable hashes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual data flows detected. Warnings about standards being draft and lack of external audit are present but are standard caution notes.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Ethereum message encoding and hashing functions with proper validation. It uses cryptographic hashing (keccak) and validation utilities appropriately. No malicious patterns, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The warnings about standards being in draft and lack of external audit are cautionary but do not indicate malicious intent. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with Ethereum signing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of Ethereum message encoding functions. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The slightly elevated risk scores (0.1-0.2) reflect caution due to standards being draft and lack of external audit, but do not indicate actual threats.",
