{
  "purpose": "Implements hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet key derivation based on BIP-0032, BIP-0043, and BIP-0044 standards, focusing on private key derivation without serialization or public key derivation.",
  "sources": "Path string parsing, parent private key and chain code inputs, HMAC-SHA512 computations, EC point calculations from private keys.",
  "sinks": "Derived child private key and chain code outputs, recursive calls for invalid keys, path encoding/decoding.",
  "flows": "Path parsing → derive_child_key calls with parent key/chain code and nodes → HMAC computations → recursive validation → output of new key and chain code.",
  "anomalies": "Recursive retry on invalid keys is standard in BIP derivation; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements BIP-0032/43/44 derivation logic, including hardened and unhardened nodes, with proper validation and cryptographic operations. Recursive handling of invalid keys is typical, with no signs of malicious behavior. No obfuscation or network activity is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's cryptographic purpose and lack of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure, and transparent implementation of HD wallet key derivation, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The scoring is appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
