{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for generating, validating, and converting BIP39 mnemonics across multiple languages, including seed derivation.",
  "sources": "Reads wordlists from local files; uses os.urandom for entropy; accepts user input for mnemonics and passphrases.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic hashing (sha256), PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512, secure digest comparison; no network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Entropy generation to mnemonic phrase; mnemonic validation via index mapping; seed derivation from mnemonic and passphrase.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cryptographic and mnemonic handling practices, including secure entropy sources, local file I/O for wordlists, and proper validation methods. It avoids obfuscation and network activity, adhering to best practices for cryptographic tools. No malicious or backdoor code is present. The cryptographic functions are used appropriately, and the code structure is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented BIP39 mnemonic utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. The low malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
