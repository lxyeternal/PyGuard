{
  "purpose": "This code implements BIP39 mnemonic phrase generation, validation, language detection, and seed derivation for cryptocurrency wallets.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, file system (reading wordlists), and function parameters (mnemonic, passphrase). The primary data input is the mnemonic phrase and entropy bytes.",
  "sinks": "Sinks include file I/O (loading wordlists), cryptographic functions (hashing, PBKDF2), and comparisons for validation. No output to external systems or network communication is evident.",
  "flows": "Input (mnemonic, entropy, environment) → cryptographic hashing and processing → validation and seed derivation. No external data flows or network communication pathways are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'secrets' for cryptographically secure randomness. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. Wordlist loading is local; no external dependencies are used dynamically. No obfuscated or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard implementations for mnemonic management and seed derivation following BIP39 specifications. It reads wordlists from local files, performs cryptographic hashing securely, and compares data using secrets.compare_digest to prevent timing attacks. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The use of 'secrets' and cryptographic functions aligns with security best practices. The code appears legitimate and designed for secure cryptographic operations. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, secure implementation of mnemonic phrase handling for cryptocurrency wallets, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses cryptographic best practices and local resources, with no network or data exfiltration evident.",
