{
  "purpose": "This code provides functionality for generating, validating, and handling BIP39 mnemonic seed phrases for cryptocurrency wallets, including language detection, wordlist management, and seed derivation.",
  "sources": "Reads from wordlist files in the 'wordlist' directory, environment variables are not used, and it utilizes os.urandom for entropy generation.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic functions (pbkdf2_hmac_sha512, sha256) to process mnemonic data and derive seeds; no direct data leakage or network activity is present.",
  "flows": "Entropy is generated via os.urandom and passed through cryptographic functions to produce seeds; mnemonic validation involves checksum comparison with secrets.compare_digest.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code correctly employs secure cryptographic practices. Wordlist loading is straightforward. No unusual code structures or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of BIP39 mnemonic management, with functions for language detection, word expansion, and seed derivation. It uses secure cryptographic functions and best practices like secrets.compare_digest for timing attack resistance. Wordlists are loaded from local files; entropy generation uses os.urandom, which is appropriate. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation for mnemonic seed phrase handling in cryptocurrency applications. There are no indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks beyond normal cryptographic operations. It is safe to use from a supply chain security perspective.",
