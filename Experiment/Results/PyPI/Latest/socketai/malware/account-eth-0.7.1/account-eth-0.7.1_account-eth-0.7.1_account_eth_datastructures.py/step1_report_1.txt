  "purpose": "Define data structures for signed transactions and messages with custom item access",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and imports modules",
  "sinks": "None; no data handling or external outputs are present",
  "flows": "None; no data flows from source to sink as there are no data inputs or outputs",
  "anomalies": "Custom __getitem__ functions are defined but lack context of usage; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a helper function __getitem__ for tuple/list access, and creates two NamedTuple classes for cryptographic data structures. The __getitem__ method is used internally within the classes to enable item access. No data input/output, network operations, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears to be straightforward data structure definitions without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data containers for cryptographic signatures, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process or transmit data in a way that raises security concerns.",
