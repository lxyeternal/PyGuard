  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual content, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code defines two data structures (`SignedTransaction` and `SignedMessage`) as `NamedTuple`s, each with a custom `__getitem__` method.\n- A global helper function `__getitem__` is defined outside the classes, which is invoked within the class methods.\n- No external data, network calls, or cryptographic operations are present.\n- The code appears to be standard data containers for cryptographic signatures, with an unusual approach to item access.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code presence of issues:\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code does not seem to contain any malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The implementation of `__getitem__` outside the class scope is unconventional and potentially problematic, as it relies on a global function rather than class methods. This could lead to confusion or bugs but isn't inherently malicious.\n\n### Review of scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code isn't obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.1). Given the code's benign nature, this seems appropriate.\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The **unusual** use of a globally defined `__getitem__` function invoked inside class methods is noteworthy. While unconventional, it does not seem malicious but could be considered a design flaw or oversight.\n- No evidence of **supply chain attack**, **malicious payload**, or **security vulnerability**.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent or payload)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 to 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to unconventional implementation)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to unconventional implementation, but no real security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The unconventional use of a global `__getitem__` function is a minor flaw but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are reasonable. I would keep malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and risk at 0.1, acknowledging the unusual method implementation but confirming it does not introduce security risks.",
