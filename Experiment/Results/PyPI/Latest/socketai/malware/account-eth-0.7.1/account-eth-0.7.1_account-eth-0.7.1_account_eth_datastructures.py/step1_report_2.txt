  "purpose": "Define data structures for signed Ethereum transactions and messages with custom item access.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily defines data containers.",
  "anomalies": "Custom __getitem__ method implementation outside class context; potential misuse or incomplete implementation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two NamedTuple classes, SignedTransaction and SignedMessage, to represent cryptographic signatures, each with a custom __getitem__ method. The __getitem__ function is defined globally and used inside class methods. The global __getitem__ attempts to access tuple elements or class attributes. No input reading, data leaks, network calls, or suspicious behavior present. The custom __getitem__ implementation is unusual but not inherently malicious; it might be incomplete or incorrectly structured. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily establishes data structures for cryptographic signatures with an unusual method implementation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks in this code segment.",
