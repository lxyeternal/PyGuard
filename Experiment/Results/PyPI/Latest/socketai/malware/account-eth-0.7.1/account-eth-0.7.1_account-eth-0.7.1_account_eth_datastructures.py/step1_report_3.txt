  "purpose": "Define data structures for signed transactions and messages in a blockchain context, with custom item access.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; data is structured within class instances.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only defines data containers.",
  "anomalies": "Custom __getitem__ function outside class context; __getitem__ is called without a clear source. No obvious malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The helper function __getitem__ appears to be defined at module scope but is used within class methods without clear intent or purpose. No hardcoded credentials, malicious network activity, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two NamedTuple classes, SignedTransaction and SignedMessage, with a custom __getitem__ method in each class that calls a standalone __getitem__ function. The standalone __getitem__ function attempts to access tuple elements or object attributes based on the index or key. No external inputs, network calls, or malicious behaviors are evident. The __getitem__ function's usage outside the class context is unusual but not malicious; it seems intended to override item access for the NamedTuple classes. There are no signs of malware, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities in this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign definition of data structures with a peculiar custom item access method. There are no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
