{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration with a custom install command that executes a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports from setuptools, defines a custom install class, and imports the 'main' function within the run() method.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function is called during installation, which could potentially execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The install process triggers the 'run' method, which in turn imports and executes 'main()' from main.py.",
  "anomalies": "The 'run()' method calls 'main()' during installation without any validation or restrictions, which can be risky if 'main()' contains malicious code or unintended behavior.",
  "analysis": "The setup script extends the standard installation process by executing 'main()' from main.py during installation. Since 'main()' is imported dynamically at install time, its behavior is unknown; it could perform arbitrary actions, including malicious activities. There are no safeguards, checks, or restrictions around this call. The code itself appears legitimate in structure but introduces significant risk because of executing external code during setup. No other malicious indicators or obfuscated code are present. The dependencies used ('requests', 'psutil') are common and not suspicious. Overall, the main concern is executing 'main()' during install, which could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary security concern is executing 'main()' during installation without validation, which could allow malicious code execution if 'main()' contains harmful logic. This behavior warrants caution, especially if the contents of 'main.py' are untrusted or malicious.",
