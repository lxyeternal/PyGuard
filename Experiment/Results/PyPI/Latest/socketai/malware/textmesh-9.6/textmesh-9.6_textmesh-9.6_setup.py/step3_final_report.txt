{
  "purpose": "The code executes the 'main()' function from 'main.py' during the installation process, which is unconventional and poses security risks.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from main import main' and the subsequent call to 'main()' within the 'run()' method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during setup acts as a sink where untrusted or malicious code can be run, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "The source is the import of 'main' from 'main.py'; the sink is the call to 'main()' during the install process; the flow is direct execution during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Executing 'main()' during installation without validation, checks, or user consent; dynamic import and execution pattern that is unusual for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, after running the standard install, imports and executes 'main()' from 'main.py'. This pattern allows arbitrary code execution during package installation, which can be exploited if 'main.py' contains malicious code. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The pattern is inherently risky, especially when the source of 'main.py' is untrusted. The scores assigned in the reports reflect this concern, with malware scores around 0.75 and high security risk scores (~0.75-0.8). Given the potential for malicious activity, the overall assessment indicates a high security risk, and the pattern should be avoided or carefully validated.",
  "conclusion": "The code's pattern of executing 'main()' during setup introduces a significant security vulnerability, as it can run arbitrary code without validation. This pattern is commonly associated with malicious or sabotage behavior in supply chain attacks. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a high malware likelihood (0.75) and security risk (0.75-0.8). It is recommended to remove or modify this pattern to prevent arbitrary code execution during installation.",
