{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it via HTTP requests to specific external URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), retrieves MAC addresses via subprocess calls, generates a random number, encodes MAC addresses in base64.",
  "sinks": "URLs constructed with system data, used in urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to external domains.",
  "flows": "System info and MAC address are collected, encoded, then appended as URL parameters and sent over HTTP to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated-looking URLs; encodes MAC addresses in base64 before transmission; dynamically constructs URLs with system data. The URLs appear suspicious and could be used for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code collects identifiable system information, encodes MAC addresses, and transmits this data to multiple external domains. The use of obfuscated URLs and the data collection pattern suggest potential tracking or reconnaissance behavior. No malicious payloads (e.g., system modification, data theft, or malware delivery) are evident, but the behavior of data exfiltration to unknown external servers is suspicious. The code does not appear to perform malicious actions beyond information gathering and transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The script is primarily designed for system information gathering and sending it to external servers. While it does not contain explicit malware or destructive actions, its behavior of transmitting system data to suspicious domains indicates potentially malicious or privacy-invasive intent, especially if used without user consent.",
