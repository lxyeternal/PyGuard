  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs with encoded MAC addresses as parameters.",
  "sources": "platform.node() for hostname, getpass.getuser() for username, os.getcwd() for current directory, get_mac_addresses() function for MAC addresses, random.randint() for random number, urllib.request.urlopen() for network requests.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to send data to external URLs with encoded parameters.",
  "flows": "Collected data (hostname, username, current path, MAC addresses) is base64-encoded and included in URL parameters. The URLs are constructed with dynamic path segments and parameters, then requested over HTTP.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with obfuscated domain-like strings, transmission of system info to these URLs. No explicit malicious payloads in the code, but data exfiltration is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are encoded with base64 before being sent. The URLs appear suspicious, potentially malicious or used for tracking or exfiltration. The code dynamically constructs URLs with unique random numbers and parameters, then performs HTTP GET requests. The network activity and data collection, especially to obscure or suspicious domains, raise concerns about privacy invasion or data exfiltration. No explicit malware or backdoor code is present, but the behavior of collecting and transmitting system info to external domains without user consent is suspicious and possibly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears designed to collect and transmit system information to external servers, which could be used for malicious purposes such as user tracking or data exfiltration. There is no direct malware payload, but the data collection and transmission pattern are suspicious and pose a security risk. Overall, this code warrants caution due to its potential for malicious activity.",
