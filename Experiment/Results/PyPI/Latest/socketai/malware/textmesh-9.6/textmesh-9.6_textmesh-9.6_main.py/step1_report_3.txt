  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "Reads system details (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), MAC addresses (via subprocess calls), and generates a random number.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs with encoded system data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Collects data from sources, encodes MAC addresses, constructs URL with parameters, and transmits data via network requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and repeated HTTP requests with encoded parameters suggest potential data exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors identified, but the nature of external communications raises concern.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers host-specific information, including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, which are encoded in base64. It then constructs URLs pointing to potentially malicious or suspicious domains and sends the collected data via HTTP GET requests. The use of random numbers in the URL path may be to evade detection or caching. The code does not perform any malicious actions like system modification, data theft, or remote control but can be used for fingerprinting or tracking without user consent. The external URLs are suspicious, and data transmission is covertly embedded in URL parameters, which could be used for data collection or malicious tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily collecting system info and transmitting it to suspicious external servers, indicating potential malicious intent or data exfiltration behavior. While it does not contain overt malware like backdoors or destructive actions, its covert data collection and transmission behavior raise security concerns.",
