{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send this data encoded in base64 to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which reads system-specific network interface data.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send data to external URLs, passing system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, current_path, MAC addresses) are gathered, encoded, and then included as URL parameters in HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for MAC addresses; URLs used for data exfiltration (likely malicious or suspicious). No validation or sanitization of data before transmission; the external URLs are non-standard and appear to be used for tracking or exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system identification details, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this information via HTTP GET requests to three different external URLs. The URLs are non-standard and appear to be designed for tracking or data collection purposes. The code does not perform any validation or handling of the responses, which suggests purposefully minimal interaction. The use of external URLs with potentially malicious or tracking domains, combined with the collection of system info, indicates possible data exfiltration or malicious surveillance. There are no signs of code obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads; however, the pattern of data collection and transmission is suspicious, especially if used without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is collecting sensitive system information and transmitting it to external domains that appear suspicious. While it does not contain overt malicious payloads like system damage or reverse shells, it resembles a data exfiltration or tracking behavior. The risk is moderate, primarily due to the external communication to suspicious URLs.",
