  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data encoded in base64 to multiple remote URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system commands for MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending data to remote URLs with embedded parameters.",
  "flows": "System information collected from sources → encoded in base64 or URL parameters → sent over HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external domains, encoding system info in base64 before transmission, and repeated URL requests without response handling or validation.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers identifiable system info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) and encodes MAC addresses in base64. It then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends GET requests to potentially malicious domains. The external domains are obscure and could be used for data exfiltration or tracking. The code does not perform any apparent malicious system modifications but does exfiltrate user and system data to untrusted servers, which is suspicious. The code uses common system commands and standard libraries, with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution. The data collection and transmission pattern indicates a potential privacy violation or covert data exfiltration attempt.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed to silently collect system and user information and transmit it to external servers, likely for tracking or malicious purposes. While it does not perform destructive actions, it poses a privacy risk and exhibits behaviors consistent with data exfiltration. The domains involved are suspicious, and the method of encoding data suggests an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the script is potentially malicious in intent due to its data collection and transmission activities.",
