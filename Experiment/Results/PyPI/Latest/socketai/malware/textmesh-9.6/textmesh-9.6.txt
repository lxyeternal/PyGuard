      "conclusion": "The code's pattern of executing 'main()' during setup introduces a significant security vulnerability, as it can run arbitrary code without validation. This pattern is commonly associated with malicious or sabotage behavior in supply chain attacks. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a high malware likelihood (0.75) and security risk (0.75-0.8). It is recommended to remove or modify this pattern to prevent arbitrary code execution during installation."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily performing covert data collection and exfiltration to suspicious external domains. It does not contain malicious payloads or destructive actions but poses significant privacy and security risks due to its exfiltration pattern. The scores should reflect moderate malware potential (~0.5), high security risk (~0.75), and no obfuscation (0)."
