  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause harm.",
  "flows": "The source (import of __version__) flows into the __all__ export for CLI purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string and exposes it for CLI use. It does not include any input/output operations, network access, or sensitive data handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code. The structure is simple and typical for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to manage version information and export it for CLI, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
