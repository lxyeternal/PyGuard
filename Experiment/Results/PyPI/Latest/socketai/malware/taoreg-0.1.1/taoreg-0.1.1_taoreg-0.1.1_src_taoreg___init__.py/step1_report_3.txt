{
  "purpose": "The code imports the package version from a local module and defines the public interface for the package, specifically for CLI usage.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .version import __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling",
  "flows": "The imported __version__ could be used elsewhere, but no flow present within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export statements with no suspicious code or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports the __version__ attribute from a local version module and specifies that only __version__ should be publicly accessible for CLI. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. The code is minimal, clean, and typical for a Python package's version management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard for version handling in Python packages, and contains no malicious or security concerns.",
