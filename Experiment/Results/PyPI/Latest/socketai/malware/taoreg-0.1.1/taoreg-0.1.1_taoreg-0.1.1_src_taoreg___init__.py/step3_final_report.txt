  "purpose": "Expose the package's version information for external use, typically in CLI or API contexts.",
  "sources": "Import of __version__ from a local module (.version).",
  "sinks": "None; no external data flow, network activity, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Simple import of __version__ from local module to module namespace; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for version exposure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __version__ from a local module and exposes it via __all__, a common pattern. No external communication, data processing, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is clear, simple, and serves a benign purpose. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assign high confidence scores, and the scores align with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving a standard version export function. All reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the lack of malicious or security concerns. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
