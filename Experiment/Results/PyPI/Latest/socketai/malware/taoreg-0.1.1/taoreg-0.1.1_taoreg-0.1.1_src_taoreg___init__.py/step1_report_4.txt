  "purpose": "Export the package version for external use, likely for CLI or programmatic access.",
  "sources": "Importing __version__ from a local version module.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data sinks or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source (__version__) to any sink; simple import and export.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module and exposes it via __all__, typical for Python packages. No user input, no network activity, and no suspicious code paths are present. It appears to be a standard version export pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to expose the package version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
