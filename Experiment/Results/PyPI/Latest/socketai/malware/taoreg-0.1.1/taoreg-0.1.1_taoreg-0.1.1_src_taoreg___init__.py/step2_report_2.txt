  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code snippet is minimal, straightforward, and typical for exposing version info in Python packages.\n- No suspicious code, external communications, or data processing are present.\n- All reports agree on benign intent and lack of malicious activity.\n\n**Confirming code issues:**\n- The code imports `__version__` from a local module named `.version`.\n- It exports only `__version__` via `__all__`.\n- No sinks, no data flow to external systems, no anomalies, no obfuscation.\n- No evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the benign nature.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n- These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- Since all scores are 0, no higher risk scores are justified.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or pose security risks.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**\n- The code does not do anything malicious—no code injection, external communication, or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; all indicate no risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0**\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, minimal version export pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores provided are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
