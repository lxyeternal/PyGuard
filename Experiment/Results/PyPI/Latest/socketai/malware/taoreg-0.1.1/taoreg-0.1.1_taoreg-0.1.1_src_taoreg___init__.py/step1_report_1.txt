{
  "purpose": "To expose the version information of the package for external use, likely for CLI or other programmatic access.",
  "sources": "Importing __version__ from a local module named 'version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is being written out or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'version' module's __version__ attribute to the exported __all__ list, which is used for exposing module attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code constructs observed; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local 'version' module and explicitly exports it for external use, typically for CLI or API purposes. The code is minimal and does not perform any untrusted operations, data processing, or external communications. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The structure and content are typical for version management in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving the purpose of exposing version information. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
