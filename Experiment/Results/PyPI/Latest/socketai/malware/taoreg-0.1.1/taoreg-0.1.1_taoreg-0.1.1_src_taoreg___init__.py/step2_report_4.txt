  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the associated reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code imports `__version__` from a local module `.version`.\n   - It sets `__all__` to expose only `__version__`.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for version management in Python packages.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No sinks, external network calls, or data processing.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n   - The purpose is solely to expose version info, which is common and benign.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with confidence level 1.\n   - They correctly identify that no suspicious patterns or security issues are present.\n   - The analysis in each report aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, justified by the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - Since the code is minimal and standard, there's no reason to adjust scores.\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code is a typical version import/export snippet with no security concerns.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n   - No further action needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation, and the security risk is negligible.",
