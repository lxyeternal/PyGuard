  "purpose": "This code imports a version string from a local module and specifies that only the version should be publicly accessible, likely for CLI use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .version import __version__",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output occurs",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors; straightforward import and export",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of a version string and sets __all__ to limit exported symbols. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs. The code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, standard module snippet for managing version information and CLI exports. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
