{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated code intended to be executed after decompression and decoding, likely to conceal its true behavior.",
  "sources": "Input sources are embedded within the code via base64-encoded, reversed byte strings, which are then decoded and decompressed.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decompressed code via exec() function, which could run arbitrary and potentially malicious code.",
  "flows": "Base64-encoded data is reversed, then decoded and decompressed to produce executable code, which is run immediately with exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscation techniques such as string reversal, base64 decoding, and zlib decompression; dynamic code execution; absence of any clear comments or purpose; highly compressed and encrypted looking payload.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that imports zlib and base64 modules to decode and decompress an embedded data blob. This blob is a reversed base64-encoded string, which, when processed, yields arbitrary code. The code then executes this decompressed code via exec(). Such obfuscation combined with dynamic execution is commonly used to hide malicious payloads, backdoors, or other harmful behaviors. No other logic or functions are visible outside this obfuscation process. The reliance on runtime decompression and decoding indicates intent to conceal malicious intent or evade static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and concealed payloads. It is likely malicious and intended to run arbitrary code, which could be harmful or malicious behavior. This pattern matches common tactics used in malware to evade detection and execute hidden payloads.",
