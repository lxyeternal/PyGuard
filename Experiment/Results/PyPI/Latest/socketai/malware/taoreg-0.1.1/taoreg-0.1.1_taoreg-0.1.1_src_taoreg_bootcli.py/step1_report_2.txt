  "purpose": "Obfuscated Python code intended to decode and execute hidden payload",
  "sources": "Input data is embedded in the encoded string passed to the decompression and decoding functions within the lambda",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamic code via exec() which runs the decompressed and decoded payload",
  "flows": "Data is base64-decoded and reversed, then decompressed with zlib, then executed via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of string reversal, base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and exec() indicates obfuscation; no explicit hardcoded secrets, but the dynamic code execution is suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that imports zlib and base64 modules, reverses a long encoded string, base64-decodes it, and decompresses the result. It then executes the decompressed payload using exec(). This pattern is typical of obfuscated malicious scripts designed to hide their true intent. The payload is concealed in a heavily encoded format, making manual analysis difficult. The use of exec() on dynamically decoded data can lead to arbitrary code execution, which is a high security risk. No other suspicious or malicious behavior (e.g., network activity, backdoors) is explicitly visible within this snippet, but the method of obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and executes dynamically decoded code, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts. The pattern indicates an intent to conceal harmful payloads. While no explicit malicious actions are visible in this fragment, the obfuscation and dynamic execution pose a high risk. Use of this package should be avoided unless the payload is thoroughly analyzed and verified safe.",
