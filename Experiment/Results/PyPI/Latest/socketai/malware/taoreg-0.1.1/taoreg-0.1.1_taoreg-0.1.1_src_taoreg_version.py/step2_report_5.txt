  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of the string `\"0.1.1\"` to the variable `__version__`. This is a common practice in Python packages for version control and metadata. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or complex logic involved.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**  \n- None of the reports identify any malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.  \n- The code is straightforward, minimal, and standard for package versioning.\n\n3. **Obfuscation & Anomalies**  \n- All reports note that the code is not obfuscated and contains no anomalies.  \n- One report (number 5) assigns a slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still concludes benignity.\n\n4. **Risk & Malware Scores**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.  \n- Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with benign code.\n\n5. **Scores & Justification**  \n- The scores assigned in the reports seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.  \n- The only minor discrepancy is report 5's confidence score (0.9 vs. 1), which seems reasonable given the minimal context, but still indicates high confidence in benignity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities, as the code is simply a version string assignment.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a score of 0 is appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** High confidence (1) is justified, as the code is trivial and standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet is a benign, standard version declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.  \n- Confidence can be set at 1, reflecting certainty about benignity.",
