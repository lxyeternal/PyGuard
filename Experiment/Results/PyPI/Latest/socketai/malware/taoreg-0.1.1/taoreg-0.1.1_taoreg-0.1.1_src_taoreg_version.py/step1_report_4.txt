  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package as '0.1.1', indicating a fresh start with a new name.",
  "sources": "The only source is the assignment of the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or input-output paths, as the code simply assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the variable __version__, a common practice in Python packages to specify version information. There are no inputs, no external data sources, and no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation. The comment suggests a 'fresh start with a new name,' but this is merely a descriptive comment and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard version assignment statement with no malicious or suspicious features.",
