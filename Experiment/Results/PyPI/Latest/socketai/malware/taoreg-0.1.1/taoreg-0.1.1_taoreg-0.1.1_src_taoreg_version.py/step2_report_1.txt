  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code simply assigns the string `\"0.1.1\"` to the variable `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or executable logic beyond this assignment.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard practices for versioning in Python packages.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No reports find any anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The comments mention \"fresh start with a new name,\" but this is merely a descriptive comment, not indicative of malicious intent.\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious code.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n   - The security risk scores are 0 or very close to it, reflecting the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable given the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Issues & Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The only slight discrepancy is in report 5, which assigns a confidence of 0.9 instead of 1. Given the simplicity and clarity of the code, a confidence of 1 is justified.\n   - All other scores seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code snippet is a standard version declaration in Python, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n   - The reports are accurate in their assessments and scoring.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be 0, as the code is clear and unobfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be 0, given the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** Can be confidently set to 1 for all reports, as the analysis is straightforward.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus that the code is purely for versioning, with no security concerns.",
