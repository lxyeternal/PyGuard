  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable for package metadata.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic version string assignment with no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with scores reflecting no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk. The confidence scores are appropriate; a score of 1 is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
