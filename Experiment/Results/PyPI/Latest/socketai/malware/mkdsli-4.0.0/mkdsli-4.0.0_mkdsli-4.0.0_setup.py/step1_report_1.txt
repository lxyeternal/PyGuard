  "purpose": "Custom installation process that collects system information during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with parameters including hostname, current directory, and username",
  "flows": "System info is gathered (source), then sent via HTTP GET request to an external server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of sending host, current directory, and username data during installation without user consent or notification. Use of hardcoded external URL for data exfiltration. No validation or encryption of transmitted data.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the setup process to include a custom install step that, after performing the standard installation, collects sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username. This data is then sent via an HTTP GET request to an external server. The URL used appears suspicious and is likely a command-and-control or data exfiltration endpoint. No safeguards or user notifications are present, and the code operates silently during package installation, which is indicative of malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code or malware signatures detected beyond this data collection behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs potentially malicious data exfiltration during installation by sending system information to an external server. This behavior is suspicious and indicates possible malicious intent, such as tracking or unauthorized data collection. The package should be treated with caution.",
