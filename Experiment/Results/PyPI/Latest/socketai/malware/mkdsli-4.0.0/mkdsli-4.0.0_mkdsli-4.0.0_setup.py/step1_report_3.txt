{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation process.",
  "sources": "Data sources include socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), and the requests.get() call with parameters.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends collected data (hostname, current directory, username) to an external server.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system information collection (hostname, cwd, username) through the 'ploads' dictionary into the HTTP request to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "The requests to an external domain occur during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The URL appears suspicious and may be used for data exfiltration. No validation or user consent is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup-related modules and system information libraries. It defines a custom install class that overrides the run method. During installation, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a potentially malicious external server. The request URL is suspicious and resembles a command-and-control or data collection endpoint. There are no safeguards, logging, or user notifications, which are typical indicators of malicious behavior. The code's purpose appears to be gathering user system info covertly at install time, which is not standard behavior for a legitimate package.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent by exfiltrating user system information during installation without user consent to an external server with a suspicious URL. This behavior indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior, representing a security risk.",
