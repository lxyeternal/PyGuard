{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'mkdsli' Python package with a custom install behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads hostname, current working directory, and username from system calls and environment.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends data to an external server (http://o2zel35m.requestrepo.com).",
  "flows": "During installation, system info (hostname, cwd, username) is collected and sent via HTTP GET request to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during installation without user consent; the URL appears suspicious and used for tracking or malicious purposes. The code does not sanitize or validate data; it executes external network communication in a setup context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that extends setuptools' install. During the run method, it collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to an external URL via a GET request. The external URL is suspicious and potentially malicious, designed to track or exfiltrate user information upon package installation. There are no other malicious behaviors or obfuscated code, but the act of exfiltrating environment data during setup is suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes. This behavior resembles a supply chain attack or privacy violation, as the user is not informed of this network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent, indicating a supply chain security concern. The external URL's suspicious domain further supports malicious intent. Overall, this package should be considered malicious or compromised.",
