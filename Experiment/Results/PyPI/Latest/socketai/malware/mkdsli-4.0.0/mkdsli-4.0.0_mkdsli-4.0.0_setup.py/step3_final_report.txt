{
  "purpose": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation by sending system information to a suspicious external URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during the run() method of the CustomInstall class.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call transmits collected data to an external server, acting as the sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system info collection (source) to the requests.get() call (sink), executing during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration during installation without user notification, sending sensitive info to a suspicious domain.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon execution, gathers hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL. This behavior is unusual for legitimate packages and indicates covert data collection. The URL is external and untrusted, raising privacy and security concerns. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the act of silently exfiltrating system info during setup qualifies as malicious activity. The high malware and security risk scores assigned in reports are justified by this behavior, which resembles supply chain attack tactics. No logical errors or false assumptions are present; the behavior is clearly malicious and warrants high alert.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during installation, justifying high malware (0.9) and security risk (0.9) scores. The code is not obfuscated, and the activity poses a significant privacy and security threat. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior, and the package should be flagged as malicious or compromised.",
