{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package using setuptools, with a custom install command that executes additional code after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during the custom installation process.",
  "sinks": "The data collected (hostname, cwd, username) is sent via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://o2zel35m.requestrepo.com).",
  "flows": "During installation, system info is gathered and then transmitted to an external server through a network request.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a network request to an external domain upon installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior. The URL appears obfuscated or non-standard, suggesting possible malicious intent. No validation or user consent is involved.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom install command that, after executing the standard installation, collects system data: hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this data to an external server via an HTTP GET request. This behavior is suspicious because it gathers potentially sensitive information without user knowledge or consent and transmits it externally, which could facilitate tracking, data theft, or malicious surveillance. The URL used for data exfiltration is obfuscated or non-standard, indicating potential malicious intent. The rest of the code is standard package setup, but the side effect introduced by CustomInstall is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes malicious behavior by collecting system information during installation and exfiltrating it to an external server without user consent. This behavior suggests a supply chain attack vector or malicious package intent. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered dangerous for use.",
