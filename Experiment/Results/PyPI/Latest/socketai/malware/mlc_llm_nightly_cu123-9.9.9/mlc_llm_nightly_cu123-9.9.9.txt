      "conclusion": "The package exhibits high-risk behavior by executing external, unverified code during installation, which could be malicious. Unless the external module and its 'main' function are verified as safe, this code should be considered malicious or compromised. The malware score should be set around 0.8, and the security risk score similarly high, reflecting the potential for supply chain attacks."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, functioning as a covert data exfiltration tool with obfuscation and reconnaissance capabilities. The suspicious DNS lookups, hardcoded IP, and deep process traversal confirm its malicious nature. The malware score should be set at 0.85, obfuscation at 0.8, and security risk at 0.85, reflecting its high threat level."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is low, primarily related to potential misuse of system calls if inputs are untrusted. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and risk scores around 0.2–0.3, slightly higher in cases involving system calls without input sanitization."
