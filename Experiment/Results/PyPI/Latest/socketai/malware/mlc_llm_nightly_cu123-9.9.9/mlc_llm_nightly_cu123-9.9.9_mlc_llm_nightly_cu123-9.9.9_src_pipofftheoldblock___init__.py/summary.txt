  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is low, primarily related to potential misuse of system calls if inputs are untrusted. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and risk scores around 0.2–0.3, slightly higher in cases involving system calls without input sanitization."
