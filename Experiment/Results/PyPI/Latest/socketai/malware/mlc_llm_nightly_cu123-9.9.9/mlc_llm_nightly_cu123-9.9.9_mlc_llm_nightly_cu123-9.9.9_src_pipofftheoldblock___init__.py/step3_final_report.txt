  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, system calls, external data sources, files, network interfaces.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network connections, file operations, data outputs, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) to processing functions and then to sinks (system calls, network, files).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected; code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets show typical data processing with input handling and system interactions. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident. System calls are present but not exploited maliciously. Risk primarily arises from untrusted input usage, but no active threats are identified. The confidence in benign assessment is high, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is low, primarily related to potential misuse of system calls if inputs are untrusted. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and risk scores around 0.2–0.3, slightly higher in cases involving system calls without input sanitization.",
