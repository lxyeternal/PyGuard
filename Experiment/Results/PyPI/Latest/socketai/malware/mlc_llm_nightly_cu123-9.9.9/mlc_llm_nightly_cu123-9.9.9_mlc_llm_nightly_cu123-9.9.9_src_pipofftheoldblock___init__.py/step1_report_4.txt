{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or functionality related to a Python package, but no explicit purpose is clear due to lack of comments or documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user input, environment variables, and potentially external files or network sources (if present). Specific input sources are not clearly visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or execution functions if present. No explicit network or file operations are evident in the given code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables to various functions and possibly to output or storage mechanisms. Without explicit code, specific source-to-sink paths cannot be fully identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code are apparent. The code appears straightforward, with no unusual patterns or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The provided code lacks clear signs of malicious behavior. It does not contain obfuscated code, hidden dynamic execution, or suspicious data handling. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard, and there are no evident backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms. The absence of comments and context limits full assessment, but based on the visible content, no malicious or security-compromising actions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no obvious malicious intent or security risks. It follows typical coding patterns without suspicious anomalies. Due to limited context, a low confidence level is maintained, but no immediate threats are evident.",
  "confidence": 0.3,
  "obfuscated": 0,
