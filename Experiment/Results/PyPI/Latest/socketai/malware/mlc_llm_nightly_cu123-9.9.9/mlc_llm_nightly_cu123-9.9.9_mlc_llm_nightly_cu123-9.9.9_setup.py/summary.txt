  "conclusion": "The package exhibits high-risk behavior by executing external, unverified code during installation, which could be malicious. Unless the external module and its 'main' function are verified as safe, this code should be considered malicious or compromised. The malware score should be set around 0.8, and the security risk score similarly high, reflecting the potential for supply chain attacks."
