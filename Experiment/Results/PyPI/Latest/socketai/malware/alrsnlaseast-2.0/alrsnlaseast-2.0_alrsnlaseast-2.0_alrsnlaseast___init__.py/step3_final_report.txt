{
  "purpose": "Conditionally executes remote code fetched over HTTP when 'torchvision' is importable, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Import attempt of 'torchvision'; subprocess.run() executing shell command with remote URL.",
  "sinks": "Shell command execution via subprocess with remote content piped into bash.",
  "flows": "Import 'torchvision' -> successful import triggers subprocess.run() -> curl fetch from remote IP -> piped into bash for execution.",
  "anomalies": "Remote code fetched over HTTP and executed without validation; use of shell=True; trigger based on module presence.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for 'torchvision' module; if present, it runs a shell command that downloads remote content over HTTP from a suspicious IP and pipes it directly into bash for execution, with no validation or sanitization. The use of 'shell=True' and remote code execution pattern are classic indicators of malicious activity. The remote URL is untrusted, and executing fetched content without validation poses a severe security risk. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but highly dangerous, representing a remote code execution vector likely used for malware deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates a high probability of malicious behavior, executing remote code without validation triggered by the presence of 'torchvision'. It should be classified as malware with maximum security risk due to the remote code fetch and execution pattern.",
