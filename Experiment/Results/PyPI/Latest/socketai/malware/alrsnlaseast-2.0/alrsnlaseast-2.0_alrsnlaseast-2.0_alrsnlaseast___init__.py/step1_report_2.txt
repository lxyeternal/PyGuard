  "purpose": "The code attempts to conditionally execute a remote script if the 'torchvision' module is present.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'torchvision', subprocess.run executing a shell command with curl and bash.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run executing remote code fetched via curl and piped directly into bash.",
  "flows": "Import 'torchvision' -> if successful, run shell command that fetches remote script and executes it.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with shell=True, fetching and executing remote script without validation, no error handling for the subprocess execution, and presence of suspicious IP address and URL.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if the 'torchvision' module can be imported. If yes, it runs a shell command that uses curl to fetch a file from an IP address over HTTP, and pipes it directly into bash for execution. This pattern is highly suspicious because it allows remote code execution without validation, and the remote URL is potentially malicious. The use of shell=True increases risk of injection, although here it's used with a fixed command. The code lacks any validation, logging, or safeguards, indicating malicious intent or at least dangerous behavior. No obfuscation is apparent; the code is straightforward but intentionally risky.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious due to its conditional remote code execution triggered by the presence of a specific module. It likely attempts to execute malicious remote code, representing a severe security risk. The overall malicious behavior score is high, and the security risk is critical.",
