  "purpose": "Attempt to import the 'torchvision' module and, if successful, execute a shell command that fetches and executes remote code.",

  "flows": "Import 'torchvision' -> if successful, fetch and execute remote script via curl | bash",
  "anomalies": "Use of shell=True in subprocess with remote URL, executing remote code directly without validation, reliance on import success to trigger malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'torchvision'. If the import succeeds, it runs a shell command that uses curl to fetch a file from a suspicious IP address and pipe it directly into bash for execution. This indicates remote code execution triggered conditionally upon the presence of 'torchvision'. The use of 'shell=True' and direct execution of remote content is highly risky and typical of malicious activity. The import check seems to serve as a trigger rather than a legitimate condition, making the malicious intent likely. No other suspicious or obfuscated code is present, but the remote code execution is a significant concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious; it conditionally executes remote code fetched from an external IP, which could compromise the system. The import check appears to be a trigger for malicious activity.",
