  "purpose": "Dynamically importing torchvision module and executing a command to fetch and execute remote content via curl and bash.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module('torchvision') - checks for torchvision module; subprocess.run() - executes a shell command to fetch and run remote script.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() - executing remote code fetched via curl and bash, which can lead to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Import check (source) triggers remote code execution (sink) via subprocess when 'torchvision' is available.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run() with shell=True to execute remote content fetched over HTTP; absence of input validation or security checks; executing code directly from network source.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'torchvision'. If successful, it runs a shell command that fetches a script or commands from an external IP address and executes them directly via bash. This introduces a high risk of executing malicious remote code, which could lead to compromise of the host system. The code does not sanitize or verify the fetched content. The use of shell=True further increases risk as it allows execution of complex shell commands. Overall, the pattern indicates malicious behavior intent, as it downloads and executes remote content without validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by conditionally executing remote code fetched over HTTP, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. It should be considered highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
