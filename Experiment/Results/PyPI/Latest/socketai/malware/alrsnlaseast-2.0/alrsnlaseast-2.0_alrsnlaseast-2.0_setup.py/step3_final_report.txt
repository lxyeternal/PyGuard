  "purpose": "A minimal Python setup script using distutils to define package metadata.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata within the setup() call; no external input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static code with no external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'alrsnlaseast' appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which is suspicious but not malicious; use of deprecated distutils module.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup script with no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The package name's unusual nature raises suspicion but does not constitute obfuscation or malicious behavior. The use of distutils is outdated but not malicious. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The malware score is zero, and the security risk is minimal, primarily related to obfuscation and outdated tooling. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), given the simplicity and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with a mildly suspicious package name but no malicious intent or behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
