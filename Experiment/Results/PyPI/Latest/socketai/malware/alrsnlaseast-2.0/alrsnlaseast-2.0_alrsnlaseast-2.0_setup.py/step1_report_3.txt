{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python module 'alrsnlaseast'.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function reads package metadata such as name, packages, and version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data is being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input data (metadata) flows from code definitions to the setup process; no external flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present. Usage of 'distutils' is typical but somewhat outdated compared to setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script importing 'distutils.core' and calling 'setup' with static metadata. There are no dynamic inputs, no network activity, no suspicious behavior or obfuscation. The script appears standard for packaging purposes, although 'distutils' is deprecated in favor of 'setuptools'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script used for packaging a Python module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues.",
