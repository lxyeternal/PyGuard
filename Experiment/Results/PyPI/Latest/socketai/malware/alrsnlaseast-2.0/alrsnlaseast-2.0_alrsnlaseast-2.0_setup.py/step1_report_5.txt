  "purpose": "To define the package setup configuration for the 'alrsnlaseast' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata such as name, packages, and version from hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded strings into the setup() function parameters; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools' may be outdated but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from 'distutils.core' to configure package installation. It specifies static metadata: package name, list of packages, and version. There are no dynamic inputs, external data reads, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears standard for Python package setup scripts, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. The use of 'distutils' instead of 'setuptools' is outdated but not malicious.",
