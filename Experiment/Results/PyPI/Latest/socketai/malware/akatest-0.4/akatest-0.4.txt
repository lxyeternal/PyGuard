      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The setup script's automatic call to send_to_webhook() during installation is suspicious and could be malicious if the function contacts malicious servers or exfiltrates data. The implementation details are missing, so the exact risk cannot be confirmed, but the pattern itself is a security concern. The scores reflect this uncertainty, leaning towards moderate suspicion and high risk due to the automatic network activity."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign based on its structure; the primary concern is the behavior of 'send_to_webhook', which cannot be determined from this snippet. The low malware scores are appropriate, and the risk scores reflect potential data transmission concerns. Further review of the 'send_webhook' implementation is recommended to confirm its actions."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns due to its unconventional use of subprocess to invoke curl and the URL containing '/ImBad'. However, there is no concrete evidence of malicious payloads or malicious intent. The behavior warrants caution and further review but does not confirm malicious activity at this stage."
