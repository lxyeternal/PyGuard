{
  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for the 'akatest' package, including a custom post-installation step to call a webhook.",
  "sources": "Import statements, the 'send_to_webhook' function call within the custom install class, and the entry point 'send_to_webhook' in console_scripts.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'send_to_webhook' function, which likely performs a network request or similar action.",
  "flows": "The post-install command triggers 'send_to_webhook', which is imported from 'akatest.send_webhook'. The console script 'run-webhook' also calls 'send_to_webhook'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a post-install hook to automatically call a webhook upon installation, which could be used maliciously to send data without user consent; no explicit credentials or sensitive info in code, but the behavior is potentially suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script primarily configures package metadata and a custom install command that calls 'send_to_webhook' after installation. The function 'send_to_webhook' is imported from 'akatest.send_webhook', suggesting it exists within the package. The code does not show the implementation of 'send_to_webhook', but its invocation during install and via a console script indicates potential for automated network activity. This behavior could be benign if intended for legitimate notifications, but it also presents a risk for clandestine data exfiltration or tracking. The code itself appears straightforward and not obfuscated. No hardcoded secrets are present, but the automatic webhook call upon install is suspicious and could be abused for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a potentially malicious feature: automatically executing a webhook call during installation, which could be used for malicious tracking or data exfiltration. Without the implementation details of 'send_to_webhook', the maliciousness cannot be definitively confirmed, but the behavior warrants caution.",
