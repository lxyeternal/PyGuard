{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that runs a webhook function after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for long description, imports subprocess, and imports the send_to_webhook function from akatest.send_webhook.",
  "sinks": "The send_to_webhook function is invoked during post-install, which could potentially send data over the network.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom PostInstallCommand runs, which imports and calls send_to_webhook, potentially triggering network activity.",
  "anomalies": "The send_to_webhook function is called automatically after installation without explicit user consent; no details of its implementation are provided, which could be suspicious. No hardcoded credentials are visible here. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py defines a custom installation command that invokes a function send_to_webhook from an external module akatest.send_webhook after installation completes. This behavior could be used maliciously if send_to_webhook transmits sensitive data or contacts suspicious servers. The code uses standard setuptools functions and a simple class override, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious code within this snippet. The presence of a function that executes network communication after installation warrants caution, especially since the function implementation is not provided. Overall, the code itself appears benign but could be potentially malicious depending on the implementation of send_to_webhook.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script that runs a webhook function after installation. While the script itself appears straightforward, the automatic invocation of a network-related function post-install raises some concern. The maliciousness depends entirely on what send_to_webhook does; without its implementation, the risk cannot be definitively determined. Caution is advised if the external function performs unintended data transmission.",
