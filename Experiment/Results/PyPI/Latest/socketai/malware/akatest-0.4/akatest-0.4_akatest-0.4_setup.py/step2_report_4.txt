  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the setup.py script includes a custom post-installation command that calls `send_to_webhook()` from `akatest.send_webhook`.\n- The code snippet provided shows the invocation of `send_to_webhook()` during the custom install class's `run()` method, which executes after package installation.\n- The `send_to_webhook()` function is imported but its implementation is not shown; its behavior is assumed to involve network activity, likely sending data to a remote server.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the logic and reasoning in the reports**\n\n- The reports consistently highlight that calling `send_to_webhook()` during installation is unusual and potentially malicious.\n- They note that no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are visible, but the automatic network call is suspicious.\n- The reasoning that such behavior could be used for data exfiltration or tracking is valid, especially since it occurs without user consent or explicit triggers.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- Malware scores are around 0.4 to 0.6, reflecting suspicion but not definitive malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are similarly high (0.6 to 0.7), justified by the potential for covert data transmission.\n- Obfuscation scores are 0, indicating the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n**Step 4: Justify higher risk scores**\n\n- The primary concern is the automatic invocation of network activity during package installation, which could be exploited maliciously.\n- Since the actual `send_to_webhook()` implementation isn't provided, the risk is based on behavior, not confirmed malicious code.\n- The scores seem reasonable given the context: behavior is suspicious but not confirmed malicious.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge assumptions**\n\n- Without the implementation of `send_to_webhook()`, we cannot definitively say it performs malicious activity.\n- The assumption that it might exfiltrate data or perform malicious network activity is plausible but not certain.\n- The reports appropriately acknowledge this uncertainty.\n\n**Step 6: Consistency of scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the described behavior: moderate malware suspicion, high security risk due to potential for covert activity, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0.4–0.6 (suspicious but not confirmed malicious code) — consistent with behavior but not definitive.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed).\n\n**Risk score:** 0.6–0.7 (significant concern over automatic network activity during install).\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.5** — the automatic call to a network function during install is suspicious and could be malicious, but without implementation details, it's not confirmed.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.65** — automatic network activity during install is a serious security concern, especially if the function exfiltrates data or contacts malicious servers.\n\n**Summary:** The main concern is the automatic invocation of `send_to_webhook()` during package installation, which could be exploited for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or tracking. The actual maliciousness depends on the implementation of `send_to_webhook()`, which is not provided. Nonetheless, the pattern itself warrants caution.",
