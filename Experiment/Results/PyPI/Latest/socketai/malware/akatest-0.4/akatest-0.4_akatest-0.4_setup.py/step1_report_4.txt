  "purpose": "Defines a setup script for packaging a Python project that includes a custom post-installation hook to call a webhook function.",
  "sources": "import subprocess; from akatest.send_webhook import send_to_webhook",
  "sinks": "send_to_webhook() function call within the PostInstallCommand class",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method executes and calls send_to_webhook(), which is imported from akatest.send_webhook",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically calls send_to_webhook() after installation without any safeguards, which could trigger an external network request potentially malicious or unwanted.",
  "analysis": "The script customizes the installation process to invoke send_to_webhook() after setup. This function is imported from akatest.send_webhook, implying it could send data over the network. The setup is straightforward, with no obvious obfuscation or malicious code within the visible setup file. However, the automatic invocation of an external webhook upon installation can be exploited maliciously to exfiltrate data or trigger unwanted network activity. The code itself appears normal in structure but contains a potential security concern due to the post-install hook.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes a post-install hook that automatically calls send_to_webhook(), which could lead to unwanted network activity or data exfiltration. While the code appears straightforward, the behavior of calling an external webhook upon installation is suspicious and could be malicious if the send_to_webhook function performs malicious actions. No other malicious code or obfuscation is evident, but the automatic network call is a security concern.",
