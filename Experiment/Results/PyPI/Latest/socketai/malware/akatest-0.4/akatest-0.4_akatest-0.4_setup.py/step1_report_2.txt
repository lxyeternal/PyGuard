  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'akatest' Python package, including a custom post-installation hook to call a webhook.",
  "sources": "The import of 'send_to_webhook' from 'akataest.send_webhook' within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'send_to_webhook()', which may send data over the network.",
  "flows": "After installation, the custom run method calls 'send_to_webhook()', potentially triggering network activity.",
  "anomalies": "The script runs a function that appears to send data to a webhook immediately after installation without any apparent safeguards or user confirmation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup process for a Python package with a custom install command. During installation, it imports and executes 'send_to_webhook()' from the package's 'send_webhook' module. This behavior is unusual because it causes network activity immediately after package installation, which could be malicious if the webhook URL or data is malicious. There are no hardcoded credentials or sensitive data visible in this script, but executing network calls during install is a suspicious practice, especially if the webhook URL is not verified or documented. The code also links a console script, but this alone does not pose a security risk. Overall, the primary concern is the automatic execution of 'send_to_webhook()' during install, which could be exploited for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or remote command execution if the webhook endpoint is malicious or compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The script's main suspicious element is the automatic invocation of a webhook during package installation, which could be malicious. There is no evidence of hardcoded credentials or malicious code in this snippet, but the behavior warrants caution due to its potential for covert data transmission.",
