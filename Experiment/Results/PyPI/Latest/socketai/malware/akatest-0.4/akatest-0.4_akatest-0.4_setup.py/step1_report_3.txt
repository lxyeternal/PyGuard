{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script configures the package installation process, including running a webhook call after installation via a custom command.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'send_to_webhook' from 'akatest.send_webhook'; execution of 'send_to_webhook()' during install; 'print' statement indicating webhook call.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'send_to_webhook()', which likely makes network requests to external URLs or services.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the custom 'PostInstallCommand' runs and calls 'send_to_webhook()', initiating an external network request.",
  "anomalies": "The 'send_to_webhook()' function is invoked unconditionally during installation without any apparent safeguards; no validation or parameterization shown; the code contains only a placeholder comment about the webhook but not the actual implementation, which could be malicious if the function is designed to send sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, after executing the standard install process, imports and calls a 'send_to_webhook()' function. This behavior occurs automatically on every installation, potentially sending system or environment data to an external webhook URL. The actual 'send_to_webhook()' implementation is not provided, but the invocation suggests external network activity. This pattern could be used maliciously to exfiltrate data or perform unwanted network communication. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscated code are present; however, the act of calling an external webhook without user consent or validation is suspicious and could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script's main suspicious behavior is the automatic invocation of 'send_to_webhook()' during installation, which could lead to data exfiltration or unauthorized network activity. This pattern is potentially malicious, especially if the webhook URL or function is controlled by an attacker. The rest of the code appears standard for package setup, with no other malicious indicators.",
