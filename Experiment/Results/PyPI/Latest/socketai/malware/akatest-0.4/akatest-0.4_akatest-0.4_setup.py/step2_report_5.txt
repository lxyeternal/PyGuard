  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the actual risks, validity of claims, and score appropriateness.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The setup.py defines a custom install command (`PostInstallCommand`) that, after executing the standard installation, imports and calls `send_to_webhook()` from `akatest.send_webhook`.\n- The setup also defines a console script `run-webhook` that calls `send_to_webhook`.\n- The actual implementation of `send_to_webhook()` is not provided.\n- The code does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code directly visible.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Issue Presence & Validity**\n\n**Is the issue present?**  \nYes, the code does automatically invoke `send_to_webhook()` during installation and via a console script, which could trigger network activity without user consent.\n\n**Note:**  \nThis behavior is unusual for standard package setup scripts and could be exploited for malicious purposes, such as data exfiltration or remote control.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report**\n\n- The reports generally assume `send_to_webhook()` performs malicious activity or transmits data, but **without its implementation**, this is speculative.\n- The reports correctly identify the suspicious pattern: automatic network call during install.\n- However, they sometimes suggest malicious intent **without concrete evidence** of what `send_to_webhook()` does internally.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe reports are cautious but sometimes overstate the maliciousness without knowing the function's implementation.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given & Reasonableness**\n\n- **Malware score (0.4 - 0.6):**  \n  These are moderate. Given the lack of implementation details, a malware score of 0.4-0.6 seems reasonable as a precaution, but not definitive.\n\n- **Security risk (0.4 - 0.7):**  \n  Also appropriate, considering the behavior could be exploited.\n\n- **Obfuscated (0):**  \n  Correct, no obfuscation is present.\n\n**Suggestions:**  \n- If `send_to_webhook()` is benign (e.g., just logs or pings a harmless URL), the scores could be lowered.\n- If `send_to_webhook()` performs data exfiltration, scores should be higher.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for High Risk Scores (>0.5)**\n\n- The **automatic invocation** of an external webhook during install **can be serious** because it could send environment data or other info without user consent.\n- **Risk scores of 0.6-0.7** are justified if the function could perform malicious actions, even if not confirmed.\n- The **malware score of 0.4-0.6** is also reasonable, given the potential for malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Challenging Assumptions & Potential Vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports assume malicious intent based solely on the presence of a webhook call.  \n- **Without the implementation of `send_to_webhook()`,** this remains an assumption.\n- The code pattern itself is suspicious but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Consistency of Scores with Behavior**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the observed behavior: automatic network activity during install, potential for malicious use.\n- The reports correctly highlight the suspicious pattern but should clarify that actual maliciousness depends on `send_to_webhook()`.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Overall Assessment & Personal Estimate**\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Given the behavior, I would assign a **0.4** to **0.5** score, leaning towards **0.45** as a balanced estimate, considering the lack of implementation details.\n\n- **Obfuscated:**  \n  0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Considering the potential for abuse, **0.6** is reasonable, but perhaps slightly lower if `send_to_webhook()` is benign. I would suggest **0.55**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The main concern is the **automatic invocation of `send_to_webhook()` during install**, which could be malicious if misused.\n- **Without the implementation details**, the best we can do is rate this as a **potential security concern** rather than confirmed malware.\n- **If `send_to_webhook()` is benign**, the scores should be lowered accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Aspect | Score | Justification |\n|---------|--------|----------------|\n| Malware | **0.45** | Suspicious pattern, but no evidence of malicious code. |\n| Obfuscated | **0** | No obfuscation present. |\n| Risk | **0.55** | Potential for misuse; automatic network call during install is risky. |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe actual risk hinges on the implementation of `send_to_webhook()`. If it just logs or pings a harmless URL, the risk is minimal. If it exfiltrates data or contacts malicious servers, the risk is high. Further investigation into that function is necessary for a definitive conclusion.",
