{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script defines a custom post-install command that automatically calls send_to_webhook() from akatest.send_webhook, potentially triggering network activity during package installation.",
  "sources": "The call to send_to_webhook() within the PostInstallCommand.run() method after installation.",
  "sinks": "The send_to_webhook() function, which likely performs network activity such as sending data to a remote server.",
  "flows": "PostInstallCommand.run() executes after package installation, importing and invoking send_to_webhook(), which may send data externally.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic invocation of a network request during package installation without user consent; no implementation details of send_to_webhook() are provided.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a custom install class that calls send_to_webhook() post-installation, which is suspicious behavior. The function's implementation is unknown, so the actual maliciousness cannot be confirmed. The pattern of executing network activity during install is a common tactic in malicious packages for data exfiltration or remote control. The scores assigned (malware around 0.4-0.6, security risk around 0.55-0.7) are reasonable given the behavior, but without concrete evidence of malicious actions, these should be considered cautious. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. The main concern is the potential for abuse if send_to_webhook() contacts malicious endpoints. Overall, the behavior warrants caution, but definitive malicious intent cannot be confirmed without further details.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script's automatic call to send_to_webhook() during installation is suspicious and could be malicious if the function contacts malicious servers or exfiltrates data. The implementation details are missing, so the exact risk cannot be confirmed, but the pattern itself is a security concern. The scores reflect this uncertainty, leaning towards moderate suspicion and high risk due to the automatic network activity.",
