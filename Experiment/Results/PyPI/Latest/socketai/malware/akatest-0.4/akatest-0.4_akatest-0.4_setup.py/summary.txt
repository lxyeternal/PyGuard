  "conclusion": "The setup script's automatic call to send_to_webhook() during installation is suspicious and could be malicious if the function contacts malicious servers or exfiltrates data. The implementation details are missing, so the exact risk cannot be confirmed, but the pattern itself is a security concern. The scores reflect this uncertainty, leaning towards moderate suspicion and high risk due to the automatic network activity."
