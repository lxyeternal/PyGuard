  "conclusion": "The code appears benign based on its structure; the primary concern is the behavior of 'send_to_webhook', which cannot be determined from this snippet. The low malware scores are appropriate, and the risk scores reflect potential data transmission concerns. Further review of the 'send_webhook' implementation is recommended to confirm its actions."
