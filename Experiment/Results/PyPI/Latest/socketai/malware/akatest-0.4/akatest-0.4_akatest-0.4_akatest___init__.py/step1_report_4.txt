{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function called send_to_webhook and executes it immediately, likely to send data or notifications via a webhook.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.send_webhook' when importing, and then calls send_to_webhook() which may access external network or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The function call send_to_webhook() potentially sends data over the network, possibly to an external webhook URL, which could leak information or perform remote actions.",
  "flows": "The module imports send_to_webhook from a local file, then immediately invokes it, creating a source-to-sink flow from code execution to external communication.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no complex control flow. The immediate invocation of send_to_webhook() could be suspicious if the function performs unintended network activity, but this cannot be confirmed without its implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local function and executes it immediately. The lack of additional context or code makes it impossible to determine the function's behavior. Since the function name suggests it sends data to a webhook, this could be benign or malicious depending on the implementation. There are no obvious signs of malicious intent within this snippet, but the risk depends on what send_to_webhook() does internally. The code’s simplicity limits definitive conclusions, and the potential for external data transfer warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and performs a straightforward import and function call. Without details of send_to_webhook's internal implementation, it is impossible to definitively identify malicious behavior. The pattern is common but could be benign or malicious depending on context; further review of the function's code is recommended.",
