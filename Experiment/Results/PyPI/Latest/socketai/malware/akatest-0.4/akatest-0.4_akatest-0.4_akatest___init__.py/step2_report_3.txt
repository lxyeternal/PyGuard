  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom .send_webhook import send_to_webhook\n\nsend_to_webhook()\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** The code imports and calls `send_to_webhook`, possibly to send data or notifications.\n- **Malware score:** 0.2\n- **Security risk:** 0.4\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report correctly identifies that the code imports and calls the function, but notes that the actual behavior depends on `send_webhook`. \n- The malware score of 0.2 seems reasonable; there's some concern but no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk is moderate, reflecting potential data transmission concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to report 1.\n- **Malware score:** 0.3\n- **Security risk:** 0.4\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Same reasoning applies. Slightly higher malware score, which is acceptable given the potential for exfiltration.\n- The report emphasizes that without implementation details, maliciousness cannot be confirmed.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.3\n- **Confidence:** 0.5\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report suggests minimal risk, which aligns with the absence of suspicious code.\n- The malware score is 0, which seems appropriate given the lack of evidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern.\n- **Malware score:** 0.2\n- **Security risk:** 0.3\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning aligns with previous reports.\n- The malware score remains low, which is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.7\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report indicates the code is likely benign, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- Malware score of 0 matches this conclusion.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- The **malware scores** across reports are low, reflecting the lack of evidence for malicious activity but acknowledging potential risk if `send_to_webhook` performs malicious actions internally.\n- The **security risk scores** are moderate to low, which is appropriate given the minimal code and the unknown implementation of `send_to_webhook`.\n- The **confidence levels** are generally reasonable, considering the limited context.\n\n### **Critical Evaluation & Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is minimal, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The main concern is the behavior of `send_to_webhook`, which cannot be assessed here.\n- Assigning a **malware score of 0.2–0.3** is justified to reflect potential risk without evidence.\n- The **security risk scores** are appropriately set, considering the potential for data exfiltration.\n\n### **My Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.2 – 0.3 (slightly higher than some reports if we consider the potential for malicious `send_to_webhook` functions)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.3 – 0.4 (moderate, depending on context)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Note:**\nFurther review of the `send_webhook` module is recommended to confirm its behavior. Without that, the current scores and analysis are appropriate and balanced.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and reasonable. No significant adjustments needed.",
