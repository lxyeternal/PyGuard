{
  "purpose": "The code imports and immediately calls 'send_to_webhook', likely intended for sending data or notifications to an external endpoint.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.send_webhook' module; invocation of 'send_to_webhook()' with no parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential external network transmission of data via 'send_to_webhook'.",
  "flows": "Code execution flows from import to function call, which may send data externally depending on 'send_to_webhook' implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple: it imports a function and calls it immediately. Without the implementation of 'send_to_webhook', the behavior cannot be definitively assessed. The main concern is whether this function performs malicious actions such as data exfiltration or system compromise. Given the minimal code, there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns. The potential risk depends entirely on the internal logic of 'send_to_webhook'. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0–0.3, security risk 0.2–0.4) are cautious but reasonable, considering the lack of evidence. The obfuscated score is correctly 0, as the code is clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign based on its structure; the primary concern is the behavior of 'send_to_webhook', which cannot be determined from this snippet. The low malware scores are appropriate, and the risk scores reflect potential data transmission concerns. Further review of the 'send_webhook' implementation is recommended to confirm its actions.",
