{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'send_to_webhook' from a local module and calls it immediately, likely to send some data to a webhook URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it relies on the imported function, which may internally handle data sources.",
  "sinks": "The function 'send_to_webhook()' likely sends data over the network to an external webhook endpoint.",
  "flows": "The code executes 'send_to_webhook()' immediately after import, which suggests data or system information might be sent out upon execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are visible in this snippet; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present here.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a function and calling it directly. Without inspecting the implementation of 'send_to_webhook', it is impossible to determine if it contains malicious behavior. However, the immediate call to a potentially network-sending function raises some concern about possible unintended data exfiltration, especially if the function collects system info or user data. No obfuscation or suspicious coding techniques are visible. Given the limited context, it appears benign but warrants review of the 'send_to_webhook' implementation for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is simple and does not explicitly exhibit malicious behavior. The primary concern hinges on what 'send_to_webhook' does internally. Without further details, this appears to be a straightforward data sending call but could be malicious if 'send_to_webhook' sends sensitive data without consent.",
