{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'send_to_webhook' from a local module 'send_webhook' and calls this function, likely to send data or notifications to a webhook endpoint.",
  "sources": "The code reads from an imported local module 'send_webhook' to access the 'send_to_webhook' function.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of 'send_to_webhook()' could send data to an external webhook URL, which is a potential sink if the data is untrusted or sensitive.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'send_to_webhook' -> calls 'send_to_webhook()' -> potentially sends data externally via the webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; lacks context such as what data is sent or how 'send_to_webhook' functions. The call is unconditional, which could be suspicious if data transmission occurs without input validation or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local function and immediately invokes it. There are no parameters passed, so the data sent depends on the implementation within 'send_to_webhook'. Since the function's behavior is unknown, it could be benign or malicious if it transmits sensitive data. The code itself appears straightforward, but its security impact depends on the implementation of 'send_to_webhook'. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and unobfuscated, but the immediate invocation of 'send_to_webhook' without context raises potential concerns about data transmission. Without knowing what 'send_to_webhook' does, this could be benign or malicious. Further investigation of the 'send_webhook' module is recommended.",
