{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named send_to_webhook from a local module send_webhook and calls it immediately.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module send_webhook, specifically the send_to_webhook function.",
  "sinks": "The code calls send_to_webhook(), which likely sends data to an external webhook, potentially exposing data or triggering external actions.",
  "flows": "Data is imported from send_webhook, then the send_to_webhook function is invoked, which may transmit data externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal but calls an external webhook function without context; the function's behavior could be malicious or benign. No parameters are provided, and the actual implementation of send_to_webhook is unknown.",
  "analysis": "The code imports and invokes a function named send_to_webhook. Without seeing the implementation of send_to_webhook, it's uncertain what data is sent or if any malicious activity occurs. The minimal code structure raises suspicion, as it might be used to exfiltrate data or trigger external actions covertly. The lack of parameters and context limits definitive conclusions, but the potential for malicious use exists if send_to_webhook performs undesired operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple but potentially dangerous if send_to_webhook performs malicious actions, such as exfiltration or unsolicited external communication. Without further context, the risk cannot be fully determined, but caution is advised.",
