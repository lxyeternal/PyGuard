{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'send_to_webhook' from a local module and immediately calls it, likely to send data or notifications via a webhook.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.send_webhook' module; invocation of 'send_to_webhook()'.",
  "sinks": "The function 'send_to_webhook()' potentially sends data over the network to an external webhook endpoint.",
  "flows": "The code imports the function and then calls it directly, likely executing network communication as part of the function's internal implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are visible in this snippet. The function name suggests intended webhook communication; no suspicious or obfuscated code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module and invokes it immediately. Without the implementation details of 'send_to_webhook', it is uncertain what data is sent or the nature of the webhook. The code itself is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. Given typical usage, it likely performs a standard operation such as sending data to a webhook endpoint, which could be benign or malicious depending on the context and implementation of 'send_to_webhook'. However, based solely on this snippet, no malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to simply invoke a webhook function. There are no apparent signs of malicious behavior or security issues in this minimal snippet. Further inspection of the 'send_webhook' module is needed to confirm safety, but based solely on this code, it is likely benign.",
