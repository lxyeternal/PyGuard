  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'logax' to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, and package dependencies from 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'README.md' file into 'long_description', and dependencies listed in 'install_requires' are installed during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns detected. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file for documentation purposes, then calls 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. No use of untrusted input sources or dangerous operations are present. All dependencies are standard Python packages. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
