  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The code reads a README.md file for the long description, specifies dependencies, and calls `setup()` with static metadata.\n- Author and author_email fields are empty, but this is not inherently malicious.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are reported or evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risks:** All reports give these scores as 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Potential flaws:** No flaws or mistakes are evident. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n### Critical Review:\n- **Scores:** All reports assign a malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Since there's no malicious activity, the overall risk remains at 0.\n- **Author fields:** Empty author info is not malicious but might be incomplete; it does not impact security.\n- **Dependencies:** Using 'requests' and 'pybase64' is standard; no suspicious dependencies are present.\n- **Data flows:** Only reading a local file and static data are involved; no untrusted inputs or external data flows are detected.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is a typical, benign setup script with no security concerns.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a safe, standard setup script with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
