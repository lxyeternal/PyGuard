  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration for packaging and distributing the 'logax' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; static setup parameters such as name, version, author info, description, URLs, classifiers, license, Python requirements, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no network connections, data leaks, or code execution points are visible.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the setup parameters are static or file-based reads.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; author and author_email fields are empty but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; dependencies are standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README file for a long description and defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No code execution, network activity, or data processing from untrusted sources occurs. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors in this configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no indications of malicious activity or security risks. It appears safe and standard for Python package distribution.",
