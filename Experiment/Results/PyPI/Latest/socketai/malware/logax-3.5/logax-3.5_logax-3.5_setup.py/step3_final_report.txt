  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata and dependencies specified in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data flows; no external commands or network activity",
  "flows": "Reads local file for description; static data used in setup() parameters",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. It reads a local README.md file, specifies dependencies ('requests', 'pybase64'), and static metadata. No malicious behaviors, code injection, or external data flows are present. The author fields are empty but not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and standard structure justify these scores. No anomalies or security concerns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or re-scoring is necessary.",
