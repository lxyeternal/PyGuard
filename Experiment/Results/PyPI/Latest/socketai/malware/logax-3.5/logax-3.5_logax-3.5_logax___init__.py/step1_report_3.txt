{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the 'info' module within the same package, likely for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement from '.info' module, which could include any code or data defined in 'info'.",
  "sinks": "None directly visible; the import itself does not constitute a sink, but imported code may execute or contain sinks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flow in this single line; potential flows depend on contents of 'info' module.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' can hide what is imported, possibly leading to namespace pollution or hidden malicious code if 'info' contains malicious content. No other anomalies present.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs an import statement from a relative module 'info'. Without inspecting the contents of 'info', no malicious activity can be definitively identified. The import statement itself is standard and does not imply malicious intent. However, the use of 'import *' can hide potentially malicious code within 'info' if it exists. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement, which by itself poses no direct security risk. The overall security depends on the contents of the 'info' module, which cannot be assessed from this snippet alone. No malware or malicious behavior is evident here.",
