  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed facts:\n- The code is a relative import of all symbols from a local module `info`.\n- No additional code, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- The import statement itself does not execute code beyond loading symbols; however, the contents of `info` could contain malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import all from local `info`.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that this is a simple import statement, with no inherent maliciousness.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 (high confidence in benign nature).\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code).\n- **Security risk:** 0 (no risk identified).\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The score aligns with the analysis. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that the import is from a sibling module and that maliciousness depends on `info`'s content.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5 (moderate confidence).\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence).\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low, due to potential hidden issues if `info` is malicious).\n\n**Note:** The report mentions a \"security risk\" of 0.2, which seems reasonable given the potential for malicious content within `info`. The overall assessment is cautious but not alarmist.\n\n**Score suggestion:** The security risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Similar reasoning; emphasizes that the content of `info` could contain malicious code, but the import line itself is benign.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7 (more confident).\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Reiterates that `import *` can hide malicious code if `info` contains it, but the import statement itself is not malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that the import could execute code within `info`, which might contain malicious content, but the line itself is benign.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the import line alone doesn't indicate malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0.2, reflecting the potential risk if `info` contains malicious code, which is prudent given the use of `import *`.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- Since no actual malicious code or obfuscation is evident, and the import statement is a common pattern, the overall risk remains low.\n- The only caveat is the potential for malicious content within `info`, but that cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity in the import statement itself).\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present).\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to the potential risk if `info` contains malicious code).\n\n**Summary:** The current scores are reasonable and align with the analysis. No significant adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the contents of `info` to ensure it does not contain malicious code, especially when using `import *`.",
