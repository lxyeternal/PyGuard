{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module 'info' in the same package directory, likely for use within the current module.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the 'info' module in the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "Data flow is from the 'info' module to the current module via import.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'from .info import *' can obscure what specific data or functions are imported, which might hide malicious or unintended imports; however, this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code consists solely of an import statement importing all symbols from a sibling module named 'info'. There are no additional code constructs, network operations, or data processing present. The pattern itself is typical in Python packages, but it can sometimes be used to hide malicious imports if the 'info' module contains harmful code. Since the content of 'info' is not provided, the potential for malicious behavior cannot be fully assessed. However, this statement alone does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement importing all symbols from a local module. No malicious behavior is evident from this line alone. Without additional context or content from 'info', no security issues or malware can be confirmed.",
