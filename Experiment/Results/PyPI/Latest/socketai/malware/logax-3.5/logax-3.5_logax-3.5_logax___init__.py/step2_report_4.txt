  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same line of code: `from .info import *`.\n- The code is a relative import of all symbols from a local module `info`.\n- None of the reports provide the content of the `info` module, which is critical for assessing malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned to malware are all zero, and the comments consistently state that the import statement alone is not malicious.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting potential concerns about obscured imports but not indicating confirmed vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues in the code:\n- **Presence of the code:** The code is present and correctly formatted.\n- **Malicious code:** Not present in the snippet itself; the import statement is standard.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not evident; the code is straightforward.\n- **Malware potential:** Cannot be determined without inspecting `info`.\n- **Data flow and sinks:** No data flows or sinks are visible in this single line.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning issues:\n- The reports acknowledge that `import *` can obscure what is imported, which is a valid concern for maintainability and potential malicious hiding.\n- However, none of the reports suggest that the `info` module is malicious, which is appropriate given the information.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** All zero, which is reasonable given the snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (~0.2), reflecting potential issues with wildcard imports but not indicating actual risk.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since the content of `info` is unknown, the risk assessment cannot be definitive.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis, but given the potential for malicious code within `info`, a slightly higher risk score could be justified if suspicion exists.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no evidence of malicious code in the import statement itself).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct).\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for malicious code in `info`, a cautious approach might suggest increasing the risk score slightly, say to 0.3, to reflect the risk of hidden malicious content.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The import statement itself is benign.\n- The security concern hinges entirely on the contents of the `info` module, which is not provided.\n- The current scores are reasonable but could be marginally increased to account for the potential risk of malicious code hidden within the imported module.\n\n---\n\n**Overall recommendation:**  \n- Maintain the malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Slightly increase the security risk score to **0.3** to reflect the potential risk associated with importing all symbols from an unverified module.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.3\n\nThis approach balances the lack of evidence in the snippet with the inherent risk of importing potentially untrusted code.",
