  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue Present?**  \n  The report correctly identifies that this is a simple import statement with no malicious code or behavior. The import line itself does not execute code beyond importing symbols, and no anomalies are present.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate, since no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Comments:**  \n  The confidence score (0.8) is reasonable given the context. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue Present?**  \n  The report notes that 'import *' can hide malicious or unintended imports, which is accurate. Since the actual content of 'info' is unknown, the risk depends on its contents.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — justified, no evidence of malicious code in the import statement itself.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 — seems cautious but perhaps slightly high, considering only the import statement.  \n  - Confidence: 0.5 — reasonable, given the uncertainty.\n\n- **Justification for Scores:**  \n  The report emphasizes the potential risk but rightly states that without inspecting 'info', no definitive conclusion can be made.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue Present?**  \n  Similar to previous, the report correctly states that the import line alone does not indicate malicious activity but acknowledges the risk associated with 'import *'.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 — consistent with cautious assessment.  \n  - Confidence: 0.7 — slightly higher, reflecting moderate certainty.\n\n- **Comments:**  \n  The reasoning aligns with standard security assessments for such import statements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue Present?**  \n  Same as above; the report correctly states that the line is benign but warns about the risks of wildcard imports.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 — consistent.  \n  - Confidence: 0.6 — acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue Present?**  \n  The report recognizes that 'import *' can hide malicious code if 'info' is compromised, which is accurate. It emphasizes that the line itself is benign but warns about potential risks depending on 'info'.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — justified.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 — reasonable.  \n  - Confidence: 0.5 — appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the import statement itself is not malicious but acknowledge the potential risks if the imported module contains malicious code.\n\n- The malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which is justified based solely on this import line.\n\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- The security risk scores are modest (0.2), reflecting caution due to the use of 'import *' and potential for malicious content in 'info', which cannot be assessed here.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports.\n\n- Since no actual code or behavior beyond the import statement is provided, no changes are necessary.\n\n- The overall risk remains minimal unless additional context about the 'info' module reveals malicious content.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity from the import statement alone.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — conservative, acknowledging potential issues with the imported module, but no concrete evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are thorough and cautious, correctly avoiding overestimating risk based solely on the import statement. The scores are justified and align with standard security assessment practices.",
