  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: `from .info import *`.\n- The code is a relative import of all symbols from a local module named `info`.\n- No additional code, network activity, or data flows are present.\n- The primary concern is the use of `import *`, which can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious content if `info` is compromised.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present in the snippet itself.\n- The risk associated with this pattern is generally low but can be higher if the imported module is malicious or compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code itself is straightforward and matches the descriptions. No errors or malicious code are directly visible.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** The main flaw is the use of `import *`, which is discouraged due to namespace pollution and maintainability issues, but not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores assigned:** The scores for malware are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Potential for malicious activity:** Cannot be confirmed without inspecting the `info` module, which is not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Specific report review:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; it's a simple import statement.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 (high confidence that there's no malicious behavior in this line).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 (appropriate).\n- **Verdict:** The conclusion is sound.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar, with a note that malicious content could be hidden in `info`.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5 (moderate, due to uncertainty about `info`).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2 (a slight risk, given the potential for malicious content in `info`).\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable; no issues.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same reasoning; potential risk if `info` contains malicious code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7 (moderately high, but still no evidence).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same; the use of `import *` can cause namespace pollution but isn't inherently malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same; minimal risk in the import statement itself.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- All reports agree that the import statement alone is not malicious.\n- The main concern is the potential for malicious code within `info`, which cannot be assessed here.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk scores are slightly above zero, reflecting the potential risk if `info` is malicious, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The malware scores should remain at 0 unless evidence of malicious code is found within `info`.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly at 0; no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2) are justified given the potential risk of malicious content in the imported module.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- The import statement itself is benign.\n- The risk hinges entirely on the contents of the `info` module, which is not provided.\n- The current scores are appropriate given the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### **My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code in the import statement).\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present).\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (potential risk if `info` is malicious, but no evidence here).\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The import statement alone does not pose a security threat, but vigilance should be maintained regarding the contents of `info`.",
