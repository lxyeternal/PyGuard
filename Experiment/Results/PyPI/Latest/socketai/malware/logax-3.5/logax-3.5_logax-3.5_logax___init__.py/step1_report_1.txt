  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'info' to the current namespace.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'info' module located relative to the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are evident in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flows can be determined from this single line; it only imports code.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'from .info import *' can obscure which functions or variables are imported, but this is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement importing everything from a local module 'info'. This practice can be risky if the imported module contains malicious code, but the import line itself is not malicious. No other code or behavior is present to analyze. Since no additional context or code is provided, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues directly from this line.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple relative import statement. There is no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based solely on this import statement. It is a common practice in Python packages, though the use of 'import *' can obscure code clarity but is not inherently malicious.",
