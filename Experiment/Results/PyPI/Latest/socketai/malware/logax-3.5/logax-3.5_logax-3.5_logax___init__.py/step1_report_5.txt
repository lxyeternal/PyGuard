  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'info' to the current namespace.",
  "sources": "The import statement imports data from the local module 'info'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if 'info' contains malicious code, importing could execute or include malicious content. No direct data sinks are present in this line alone.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; import could execute code within 'info', which might contain flows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .info import *' can obscure which functions or data are imported, potentially hiding malicious code. However, on its own, it is a common import pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of all elements from the 'info' module within the same package. This line alone does not contain malicious behavior but could be problematic if 'info' is compromised or contains malicious code. No further context about 'info' is provided, so the possibility of malicious content depends on that module's contents. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are visible here.",
  "conclusion": "The code only performs a relative import, which by itself is benign. However, reliance on 'info' without review could pose risks if 'info' contains malicious code. There is no evidence of malicious behavior in this line alone.",
