  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local module 'info' using a relative import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; the 'info' module being imported.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the 'info' module if it contains malicious code, but not directly from this line.",
  "flows": "Data flow depends on the contents of 'info'; the import loads symbols into the namespace, but no runtime data flow is evident here.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure imported symbols, but no malicious anomalies are visible in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of all symbols from 'info'. No code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present in this line. The primary concern is the potential for malicious code within 'info', which cannot be assessed here. The import statement itself is benign; the risk depends on the content of 'info'. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2) to reflect the potential risk if 'info' is malicious. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.8), given the simplicity of the code and lack of evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and standard; no malicious activity is evident. The risk is minimal but should be monitored if 'info' is untrusted. Scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
