{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local module 'info'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module file 'info' within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks present in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to importing from a local module; no external data flow or processing is shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a single import statement with a wildcard import; this can be considered risky in general but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single import statement using 'from .info import *'. This imports all symbols from a local module named 'info'. There are no other code operations, network actions, or data processing visible. While wildcard imports can lead to namespace pollution and maintenance issues, they are not automatically malicious or malicious in intent. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors within this snippet. The snippet alone provides minimal context, but based solely on this, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement of a local module with no evident malicious behavior. The risk is minimal, though the use of wildcard import is generally discouraged for maintainability reasons. No malware or security risks are apparent from this single line.",
