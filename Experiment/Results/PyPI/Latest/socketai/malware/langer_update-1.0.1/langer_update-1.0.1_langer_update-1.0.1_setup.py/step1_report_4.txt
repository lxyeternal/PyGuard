  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that loads a module from a ZIP archive during installation.",
  "sources": "File read operation for 'README.md', dynamic ZIP import via zipimport.zipimporter, module execution via exec_module.",
  "sinks": "exec_module may execute code from the ZIP archive, potentially containing malicious code if the ZIP is compromised.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Defining test() which loads 'my.zip' -> Executes code within 'my.zip' -> Invokes module.hello()",
  "anomalies": "Loading and executing a ZIP archive ('my.zip') during installation without verifying its contents or source, using exec_module which can run arbitrary code.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a README file and defines a test() function that loads a ZIP archive ('my.zip') using zipimport and executes its content. This ZIP import occurs during the install process, specifically when the custom install class runs. The module within the ZIP is executed via exec_module, and then a function 'hello()' is called. The ZIP archive is loaded directly from a fixed filename without any validation or integrity check. This behavior could be exploited if 'my.zip' is maliciously crafted, leading to arbitrary code execution at install time. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors but executes code from an external archive during setup, which is a risky and potentially malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script loads and executes code from an external ZIP archive during installation without validation. This behavior is suspicious and could be exploited to run malicious code if the ZIP file is compromised. It does not appear to contain obfuscation or explicit malware, but the method of dynamic code execution during setup poses a security risk.",
