{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package that, during installation, dynamically loads and executes code from a zip archive named 'my.zip'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description; executing 'test()' during installation which loads code from 'my.zip'.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'module.hello()' after importing code from 'my.zip', which could execute arbitrary code from the archive.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> executing 'test()' -> loading 'my.zip' via zipimport -> executing 'module.hello()'.",
  "anomalies": "Loading and executing code directly from 'my.zip' during installation without validation; the zip file contents are not inspected or validated.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities and defines a custom install command that runs the 'test()' function during installation. The 'test()' function loads and executes code from 'my.zip' using zipimport, then calls 'hello()' on the loaded module. This approach can execute arbitrary code from the zip archive at install time, which is potentially dangerous if the zip contains malicious code. No validation, signature checks, or sandboxing is performed on the zip contents. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads directly but executes external code dynamically, which could be malicious if the zip archive is compromised or maliciously crafted. The overall structure suggests an attempt to run code from an external archive during setup, which is a security concern. No obfuscation or hidden code indicators are present beyond dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code dynamically loads and executes code from 'my.zip' during package installation, which poses a significant security risk if the zip is malicious or compromised. It can run arbitrary code on the user's system during installation without validation, making it potentially malicious behavior.",
