{
  "purpose": "Provides a CLI tool with help display and command options for a hypothetical Python-Mojang interaction utility.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments using argparse.",
  "sinks": "Potential command execution via argparse subcommands; printing ASCII art and help info.",
  "flows": "User inputs command-line arguments → argparse processes input → corresponding help or command info displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Use of colorama and ASCII art is benign. No dynamic code execution or external network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a help display function with ASCII art, colored headers, and argparse subcommands. It only prints static ASCII art and command options based on user input. There are no input handling vulnerabilities, no external data reads, and no suspicious code flows. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears solely for user interface purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help utility with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply displays ASCII art and command options based on user input, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
