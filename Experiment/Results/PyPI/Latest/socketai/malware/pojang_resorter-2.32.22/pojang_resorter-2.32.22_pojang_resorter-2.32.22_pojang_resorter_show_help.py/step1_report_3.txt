{
  "purpose": "To display a help message with ASCII art and colored text for a CLI tool related to Python-Mojang interaction.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include command-line arguments processed by argparse.",
  "sinks": "Printing to stdout; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed to determine user commands; no further data flows to other functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; usage of ASCII art and colorama for display purposes appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored console output, defines a help display function that prints ASCII art and command descriptions, and sets up argparse subcommands. There are no signs of data leaks, backdoors, malicious network activity, or code injection. The command definitions are straightforward, serving solely to display help info. No external data sources or sinks beyond printing are used. Overall, the script functions as a benign CLI help utility with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI help display script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or sensitive operations. The inclusion of ASCII art and colored output is purely aesthetic.",
