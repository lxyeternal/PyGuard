{
  "purpose": "Provides a CLI tool for interacting with a hypothetical Python-Mojang system, displaying help and command options with colored ASCII art.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine user commands.",
  "sinks": "Uses print statements to display ASCII art and help text; no data output or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line args) is processed by argparse; no further data flow or processing beyond displaying help occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of colorama and ASCII art appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a function to display stylized help information with ASCII art and colored text, and sets up argument parsing with subcommands. It solely outputs help messages and ASCII art based on user input. No external data transmission, file handling, or sensitive operations are present. The code's structure and content are straightforward and typical for CLI help utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help utility that displays ASCII art and command options with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
