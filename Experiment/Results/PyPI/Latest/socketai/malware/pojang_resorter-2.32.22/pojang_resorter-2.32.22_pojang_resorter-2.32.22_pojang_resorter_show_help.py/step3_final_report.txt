  "purpose": "A CLI help utility that displays ASCII art and command options with colored output.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments processed by argparse; static ASCII art and help messages.",
  "sinks": "Standard output (stdout) for displaying help and ASCII art; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "User inputs command; argparse processes command; ASCII art and help info are printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI help utility that uses argparse for command parsing and colorama for colored terminal output. It displays static ASCII art and help messages, with no external data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, aesthetic CLI help utility with no security risks or malicious behaviors. It simply displays ASCII art and command options, with no vulnerabilities or obfuscation. The assessments and scores are accurate and align with the code's functionality.",
