  "purpose": "Decode and execute a base64-encoded, zlib-compressed payload after reversing it.",
  "sources": "Input data is the string passed to the lambda function (__[::-1]) which is then base64 decoded and zlib decompressed.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decompressed data via exec() function.",
  "flows": "Input string -> reversed (__[::-1]) -> base64 decode -> zlib decompress -> exec() to run the code",
  "anomalies": "The code performs dynamic decompression and decoding of an obfuscated payload, then executes it directly, which is suspicious. The payload is heavily obfuscated and encoded, making static analysis difficult. No explicit hardcoded credentials or clear malicious functions are visible without decompression.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that reverses its input, decodes it from base64, decompresses it with zlib, and then executes it. The string passed to exec() is an encoded payload that appears to be deliberately obfuscated to hinder static analysis. This pattern is commonly used in malicious scripts to hide payloads. The payload likely contains further malicious code or actions, but without decompressing and decoding, its contents are hidden. The use of reversing, multiple layers of encoding, and dynamic execution indicates suspicious intent. No benign reasons justify such obfuscation and execution pattern in typical software.",
  "conclusion": "The code dynamically reconstructs and executes a hidden payload, which is highly suspicious and typical of malicious obfuscation. The obfuscation and indirect execution strongly suggest malicious intent, such as executing hidden malware or backdoors. Static analysis is insufficient to fully understand the payload's behavior, but the pattern itself is dangerous.",
