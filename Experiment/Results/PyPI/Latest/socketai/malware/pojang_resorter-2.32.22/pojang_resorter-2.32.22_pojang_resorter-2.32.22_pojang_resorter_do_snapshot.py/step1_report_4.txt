  "purpose": "Obfuscated code that decompresses and executes a base64-encoded payload.",
  "sources": "Input data is the base64-encoded string assigned to the variable, which is then reversed.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decompressed code via exec(), which executes untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Reverse the encoded string -> base64 decode -> zlib decompress -> exec() the resulting code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda for obfuscation, reversing the string, base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and dynamic execution with exec() all indicate obfuscation and potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a lambda function that imports zlib and base64 to decode and decompress data. The string assigned to the variable is reversed, base64-decoded, and then decompressed before being executed via exec(). The payload is heavily obfuscated to hide its intent. The pattern of decoding, decompression, and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious obfuscation designed to run hidden code. The use of exec() on dynamically obtained code from an obfuscated source is a common tactic in malicious scripts, likely intended to execute hidden or malicious instructions once decoded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated payload that decodes and executes potentially malicious code, likely designed to hide its true intent. The structure indicates an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. Overall, this pattern is characteristic of malicious scripts used to run hidden code after obfuscation.",
