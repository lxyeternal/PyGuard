{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'pojang_resorter', including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version), dependencies listed in 'install_requires', and the main entry point 'pojang-resorter'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink could be the execution of 'pojang-resorter.main:main' if it takes untrusted input or performs malicious actions, but this cannot be confirmed from the setup script alone.",
  "flows": "The setup script itself does not process or flow untrusted data; it merely specifies dependencies and entry points for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. All dependencies are common and relevant for GUI automation, image processing, HTTP requests, and testing.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and console entry points. The dependencies include common libraries for GUI automation, image processing, HTTP communication, and testing. No code execution or data handling occurs at runtime beyond standard package installation procedures. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The package appears to be intended for automation and image processing tasks, with no indication of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior detected. It solely defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No security threats or malware indicators are present based on this code.",
