  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'pojang_resorter' project with specified dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "No external input; static package metadata and dependency declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; no data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "N/A; purely declarative configuration without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration using setuptools, listing common dependencies related to GUI automation, image processing, HTTP requests, and testing. It does not execute any runtime logic beyond defining package metadata. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The dependencies are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the dependencies involved, but the setup code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is legitimate, benign, and free from malicious or suspicious code. The dependency list and structure are typical for such projects. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero; the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
