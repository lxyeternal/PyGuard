{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated code that dynamically decompresses and executes hidden code, likely for concealment purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data: Base64-encoded string decoded and decompressed via zlib; internal functions and variables used for decoding and execution.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decompressed code via exec(), which can run arbitrary Python code; the decompress function may load malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoding of string -> zlib decompression -> exec() of resulting code",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda for deobfuscation, decoding, decompression, and execution; complex encoding hiding actual code; the code relies on reversing and decompressing data, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a lambda function that imports zlib and base64 modules to decode and decompress an embedded string, then executes it dynamically with exec(). The embedded string is a long base64-encoded, reversed, and compressed blob, which suggests an attempt to hide malicious payloads or obfuscate functionality. This pattern is typical of malicious scripts designed to evade static detection, as it hides the true code until runtime. The use of reversing ('[::-1]'), base64 decoding, and zlib decompression indicates deliberate obfuscation, aiming to conceal malicious intent. Since the decompressed payload is executed directly, it can perform any arbitrary action, including malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration, without the user's knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its obfuscation techniques and dynamic execution of hidden payloads. It likely contains malicious code designed to conceal harmful actions. It is recommended to treat this code as malicious until further analysis of the decompressed payload is conducted. Its obfuscation and runtime code execution are common indicators of malicious intent.",
