{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be an obfuscated script intended to execute compressed and encoded code after decoding.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the string argument passed to the lambda function, which is a base64-encoded, reversed, zlib-compressed byte string.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the result of decompression and decoding via exec, which can run arbitrary code, potentially malicious.",
  "flows": "The input string is reversed, base64-decoded, decompressed, then executed, creating a source-to-sink flow that runs arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code with layered encoding, base64, zlib compression, and reversal. Use of exec on dynamically generated code. No explicit secrets or credentials visible, but the obfuscation raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function '_' that takes no arguments, which imports 'zlib' and 'base64' modules dynamically. It then reverses a long base64-encoded string, decodes it, decompresses the result, and executes it. The obfuscation suggests an intent to hide malicious payloads. Since the decompressed code is unknown without running, it could contain any behavior, including malicious activity such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication. The layered encoding and dynamic execution are typical tactics for obfuscating malicious payloads. There are no hardcoded secrets or credentials, but the structure indicates potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious due to obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and layered encoding. It likely loads and executes malicious payloads when run, posing significant security risks.",
