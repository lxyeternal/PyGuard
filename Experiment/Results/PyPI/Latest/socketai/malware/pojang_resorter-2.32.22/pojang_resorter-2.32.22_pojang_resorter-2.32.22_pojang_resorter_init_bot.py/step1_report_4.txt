  "purpose": "Obfuscated code intended to decompress and execute hidden payload",
  "sources": "Input data: base64-encoded string that is reversed, then decompressed via zlib",
  "sinks": "Execution of decompressed code via exec()",
  "flows": "Reversed base64 data -> base64 decoding -> zlib decompression -> exec() on decompressed payload",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda to obfuscate imports and execution; reversing data string before decoding; executing dynamically decompressed code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that imports 'zlib' and 'base64' modules, reverses an encoded string, decodes it from base64, decompresses it with zlib, and executes the resulting code. The string is a large, complex, base64-encoded blob that is reversed before decoding. This pattern indicates an attempt to conceal malicious payloads or obfuscate functionality. The dynamic execution via exec() is highly suspicious, especially in combination with the obfuscation tactics. No other clear functionality is visible, and the obfuscation suggests malicious intent or malicious payload delivery.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious, employing obfuscation and dynamic execution to conceal its true purpose. It is likely malicious, designed to run hidden payloads without easy detection. It should be flagged as potentially malicious with high confidence.",
