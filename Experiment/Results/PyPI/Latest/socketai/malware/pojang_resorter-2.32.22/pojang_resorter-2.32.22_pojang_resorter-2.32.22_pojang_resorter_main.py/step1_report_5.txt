{
  "purpose": "A command-line interface tool for executing specific scripts related to Python-Mojang interactions, such as initializing servers and previewing snapshots.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (args.command), script existence checks, subprocess.run() for executing other Python scripts",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing scripts, logging errors, printing messages",
  "flows": "Command input -> script selection -> script execution via subprocess -> logging and messaging",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; command execution based on user input appears controlled, but subprocess call executes external scripts based on command mapping.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts a command-line argument, defaults to 'initialize_server' if none provided, and executes corresponding scripts via subprocess. The script mapping is static, and scripts are executed in the same directory. Error handling is implemented through logging and print statements. There are no indications of code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions such as network exfiltration, reverse shells, or system damage. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. Overall, the code performs intended control flow with no malicious behavior or security risks evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI tool for managing server-related scripts. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain risks. Its security risk level is very low.",
