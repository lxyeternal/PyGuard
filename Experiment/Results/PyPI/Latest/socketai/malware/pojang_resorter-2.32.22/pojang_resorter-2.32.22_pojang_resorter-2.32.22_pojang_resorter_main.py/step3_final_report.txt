  "purpose": "A command-line interface tool that maps user commands to specific scripts and executes them via subprocess.",
  "sources": "User input command via argparse; command mapping dictionary; script existence check.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external scripts through subprocess.run, based on validated commands.",
  "flows": "User inputs command -> command is validated and mapped -> script path is checked -> subprocess runs the script.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected. The code is straightforward and readable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a controlled CLI dispatcher that validates commands against a predefined list, checks for script existence, and executes scripts via subprocess. It employs logging for errors and defaults to 'initialize_server' if no command is provided. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The main risk depends on the trustworthiness of the external scripts, which are outside the scope of this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), justified by the controlled command execution. Overall, the code appears benign and well-structured, with minimal inherent security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, controlled CLI dispatcher with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The primary concern is external script trustworthiness, not the code itself. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
