{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata and imports the main module for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The module imports from .main, and defines __version__ and __author__ as static strings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of input handling, external network operations, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Minimal code structure; nothing unusual observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package initializer. It sets metadata attributes (__version__, __author__) and imports the main module. No input parsing, no network communication, no execution of untrusted data, or other security-sensitive operations are present. The import is relative and standard for Python packages, and no suspicious patterns are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a package initializer with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears standard and safe.",
