{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, likely serving as an entry point or package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from a local module; package version and author metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external output; no network, file, or environment variable interactions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only sets package metadata and imports a local module.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior; only standard package metadata and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes package metadata, imports a main function from a local module, and does not perform any input/output or data processing. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated behavior are present. The import statement is from a relative module, typical for Python packages. There are no external network connections, credential handling, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package entry point with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a typical setup or main module for a Python CLI package, with no security risks identified.",
