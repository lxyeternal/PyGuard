  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal Python module, likely an `__init__.py` or main module for a package.\n- It imports `main` from a local module `.main`.\n- It defines package metadata: `__version__` and `__author__`.\n- There are no data flows, no input/output handling, no network or file operations, and no suspicious code patterns.\n- The code appears standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  No. All reports agree that the code is benign, minimal, and standard for a package setup.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. Each report correctly identifies the code as a straightforward package initializer with no security concerns.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  Yes. All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 0.5, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is accurate given the code's benign nature.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import and metadata assignment.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. There are no vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious activities.\n\n**Confidence Level:**  \n- All reports show high confidence (1), which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n- The import from `.main` is standard for Python packages.\n- No external network or file operations are involved.\n- The code does not execute any untrusted data or perform any dynamic behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n  No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n  Clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk score:** **0**  \n  No security risks identified.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical package initialization script with no security issues. The reports are consistent, and their scoring reflects the benign nature accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI concur with the reports' assessments. No further action or concern is necessary for this code snippet.",
