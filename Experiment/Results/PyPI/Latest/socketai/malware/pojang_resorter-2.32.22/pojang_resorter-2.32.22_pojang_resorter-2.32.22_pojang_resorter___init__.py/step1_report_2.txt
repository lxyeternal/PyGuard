  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed; code is primarily declarative with import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a main module and setting package metadata. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
