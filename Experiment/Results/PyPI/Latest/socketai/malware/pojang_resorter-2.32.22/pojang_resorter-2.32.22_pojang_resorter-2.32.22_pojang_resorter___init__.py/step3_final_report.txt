  "purpose": "Package initialization and metadata setup for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Import from local module '.main'; package metadata variables (__version__, __author__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Import from '.main' module; setting metadata variables; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal package setup script, importing a local main function and defining metadata. No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of security concerns. The confidence level is high (1). No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization file with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-related issues. The scores are appropriate and justified based on static analysis.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
