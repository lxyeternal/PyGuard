  "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing main() during installation poses a significant security concern, as it allows arbitrary code execution at install time. While the code itself is benign, this pattern can be exploited if main.py is malicious. The scores in the reports are appropriate; a slightly higher malware score (~0.4) and risk (~0.6) would better reflect the potential severity. Overall, caution is advised when installing packages employing such patterns."
