{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'kera_preprocess' Python package, including a custom install command that runs additional code after installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules ('setuptools', 'requests', 'psutil') and dynamically imports and executes 'main' from 'main' after installation.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of 'main()' from 'main' module during installation could execute arbitrary code depending on 'main', which is a potential sink if 'main' contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the flow proceeds from the install command to executing 'main()' from 'main' module, which could perform arbitrary actions. No other untrusted data inputs are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The custom class 'CrazyInstallStrat' executes 'main()' after installation without any apparent validation or restrictions. The class name is unconventional but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The setup script is standard with the addition of a custom installation class that calls 'main()' from an external module after installation. The code does not contain obfuscated patterns or suspicious behaviors. However, executing 'main()' during installation can be dangerous if 'main' contains malicious code, as it allows arbitrary code execution at install time. No external untrusted inputs or dynamic code evaluation are present. The script appears primarily to automate a post-installation step, which could be benign or malicious depending on the content of 'main'.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears to be a typical setup script with a custom post-install hook. The main concern is the execution of 'main()' during installation, which can be a vector for malicious behavior if 'main' is malicious. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious external calls within this snippet. Overall, the code has a low to moderate risk level, primarily due to the potential for malicious code execution via 'main()'.",
