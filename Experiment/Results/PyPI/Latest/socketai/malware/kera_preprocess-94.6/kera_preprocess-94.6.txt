      "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing main() during installation poses a significant security concern, as it allows arbitrary code execution at install time. While the code itself is benign, this pattern can be exploited if main.py is malicious. The scores in the reports are appropriate; a slightly higher malware score (~0.4) and risk (~0.6) would better reflect the potential severity. Overall, caution is advised when installing packages employing such patterns."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behavior characteristic of data exfiltration or surveillance tools, transmitting system information to suspicious external servers without user consent. While it does not contain malicious payloads or system modifications, its covert data collection pattern poses a significant security and privacy risk. The current scores in the reports undervalue the malicious potential; a malware score of about 0.75 and a security risk score of approximately 0.75 are justified."
