  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behavior characteristic of data exfiltration or surveillance tools, transmitting system information to suspicious external servers without user consent. While it does not contain malicious payloads or system modifications, its covert data collection pattern poses a significant security and privacy risk. The current scores in the reports undervalue the malicious potential; a malware score of about 0.75 and a security risk score of approximately 0.75 are justified."
