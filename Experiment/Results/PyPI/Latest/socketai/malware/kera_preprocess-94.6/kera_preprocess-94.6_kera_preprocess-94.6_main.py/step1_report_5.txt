  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it encoded to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading network interfaces, random.randint() for generating a number.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() for sending data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "System info sources → data encoding (base64 of MAC addresses) → URL parameter construction → HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external suspicious URLs with obfuscated domain names, encoding MAC addresses in base64, no validation of responses, and silent exception handling. The URLs appear to be malicious or test domains. No user input is directly used, but system info is transmitted to external servers without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current working directory. MAC addresses are encoded in base64 before being sent. The code then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends this information via GET requests. The URLs are obscure and could be used for data exfiltration. The code does not include any obfuscation techniques, but the use of suspicious URLs and silent error handling raises concerns. No other malicious activity, such as executing commands or stealing credentials, is detected. The data flow is straightforward: system info → encoded data → external server communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to gather system identifiers and send them covertly to external domains, which strongly indicates malicious intent. It resembles a data exfiltration or surveillance script. The URLs used are suspicious, and the lack of user consent or transparency supports this conclusion.",
