  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, encode MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network configuration, random.randint() for generating a number, and encoded MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending HTTP GET requests with sensitive system data as URL parameters to external servers.",
  "flows": "System data (hostname, username, current directory, encoded MAC addresses) -> URL parameters -> HTTP GET request to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and sends them without any authentication or encryption. No user consent or explicit purpose provided. The URLs appear to be potentially malicious or for tracking. The code silently handles exceptions, which could hide failures or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information: hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are gathered via system commands for Windows, Linux, and Darwin (macOS). These MAC addresses are then encoded in base64 and sent as URL parameters to three different external URLs, which appear suspicious and possibly malicious due to their domain names. The use of random numbers in URL paths suggests unique identifiers or tracking. No validation, user consent, or encryption beyond base64 encoding is used, indicating potential privacy violations. The code executes network requests without verification or handling responses, which could facilitate malicious data collection or command-and-control communications.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to gather and exfiltrate system information to external servers with suspicious domains, which is indicative of malicious behavior or a tracking attempt. While it does not execute malicious commands directly, its behavior of collecting and transmitting sensitive data without user consent is concerning. The code structure and domain names raise suspicion of a potential malicious or privacy-invasive purpose.",
