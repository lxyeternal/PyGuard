  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple remote URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node() for hostname, getpass.getuser() for username, os.getcwd() for current directory, get_mac_addresses() function for MAC addresses, random.randint() for generating a number, and the URLs in the urls list.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() for sending HTTP requests with encoded system data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Collected data (hostname, username, current directory, base64-encoded MAC addresses, and a random number) are URL-encoded and sent via GET requests to remote servers, potentially exposing sensitive system information.",
  "anomalies": "The code encodes MAC addresses with base64, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The URLs appear suspicious and are unusual for benign applications. The code silently ignores exceptions during network requests, which could hide failures or malicious activity. The use of multiple URLs with a common pattern suggests obfuscation or covert data exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are retrieved via platform-specific shell commands. The MAC addresses are encoded in base64 and sent as part of URL parameters to three suspicious URLs. The use of random numbers in URLs may be to avoid caching or track unique requests. The network requests are made silently without logging or error reporting, which could hide exfiltration activities. Overall, the script is designed to collect system info and transmit it covertly to remote servers, which is characteristic of data exfiltration or potentially malicious surveillance, but there are no signs of active sabotage, code injection, or malware payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a data collection and exfiltration tool, sending system info to external servers. Although it does not include explicit malicious actions like system modification or code execution, its behavior of silently transmitting detailed system info to suspicious URLs indicates malicious intent, such as espionage or unauthorized surveillance.",
