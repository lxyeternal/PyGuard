{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration that executes a function 'main()' from a local module during installation, which is unconventional and potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "Importing 'main' from 'main' module within the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during install, which can run arbitrary code with elevated privileges.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code calls 'install.run(self)' then imports and executes 'main()' from the local module.",
  "anomalies": "Code executes 'main()' during setup without validation, and the class name 'CrazyInstallStrat' suggests suspicious intent; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses a custom install class that, after completing standard installation, dynamically imports and runs 'main()'. This pattern is unusual and risky, as executing arbitrary code during package installation can be exploited for malicious purposes. The code itself appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden secrets, but the behavior is inherently suspicious. The pattern aligns with common supply chain attack vectors, especially if 'main()' contains malicious code. The scores assigned in the reports vary, but generally reflect the risk of executing untrusted code during install. Given the pattern, a malware score of 0.75 and a security risk score of 0.8 are justified, considering the potential for malicious activity. The obfuscated score remains 0, as no obfuscation is present. Overall, the code pattern is high-risk and should be flagged for thorough review, especially if the content of 'main.py' is untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high-risk pattern of executing external code during installation, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The current scores in the reports are reasonable but should be elevated to reflect the inherent danger. The pattern warrants caution and further review of 'main.py' before trusting or deploying this package.",
