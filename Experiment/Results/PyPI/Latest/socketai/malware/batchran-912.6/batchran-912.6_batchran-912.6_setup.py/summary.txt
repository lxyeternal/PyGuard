  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high-risk pattern of executing external code during installation, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The current scores in the reports are reasonable but should be elevated to reflect the inherent danger. The pattern warrants caution and further review of 'main.py' before trusting or deploying this package."
