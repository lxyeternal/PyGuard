  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, possibly for tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send data to external URLs",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory) + random number -> URL parameters -> HTTP request to external servers",
  "anomalies": "The URLs are suspicious and may be malicious; data collection to external domains with no clear legitimate purpose; no user consent or obvious privacy notice; use of random number as a parameter; no validation or sanitization of data",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, current working directory, and a random number, then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains. It sends this data via HTTP GET requests to these external servers. The URLs are not related to any legitimate service and appear to be designed for tracking or exfiltration. The code does not perform any other actions and includes no obfuscation, but the external data transmission without user consent or clear purpose is suspicious. The domains appear malicious, potentially used for data collection or command-and-control activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects system information and transmits it to suspicious external servers without user consent, indicating potentially malicious behavior for tracking or data exfiltration. The URLs and data collection mechanisms are concerning.",
