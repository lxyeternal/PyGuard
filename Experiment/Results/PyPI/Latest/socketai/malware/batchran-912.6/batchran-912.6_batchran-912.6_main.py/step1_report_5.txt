  "anomalies": "Multiple external URLs with suspicious domain names, use of random number as a query parameter, no validation or filtering of data, possible data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, current working directory, and generates a random number. It constructs URLs with these parameters and makes HTTP GET requests to potentially malicious or tracking domains. No user input validation is performed, and the URLs appear suspicious. The code does not perform any other malicious activity but leaks system info to external servers, which could be used for tracking or reconnaissance. The domains are obscure and could be malicious or maliciously intended for data collection. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present beyond the data exfiltration behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is collecting system information and sending it to external, suspicious domains without user consent or validation. This behavior suggests potential data exfiltration or tracking, with high suspicion of malicious intent. It does not perform damaging actions but could be used maliciously for reconnaissance or privacy violations.",
