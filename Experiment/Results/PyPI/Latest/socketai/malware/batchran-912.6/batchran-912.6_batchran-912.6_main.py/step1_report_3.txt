  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to remote URLs, possibly for tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "sources": "platform.node() (hostname), getpass.getuser() (username), os.getcwd() (current directory), random.randint() (random number generation)",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url) (sending data to external URLs)",
  "flows": "System info collected from sources is included in URL parameters and sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, no user consent or notification, and transmission of hostname, username, directory, and a random number without encryption or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code collects basic system information and generates a random number, then constructs URLs with these parameters and makes HTTP requests to remote servers. The domains used are suspicious and resemble command-and-control or data exfiltration sites. The data transmission occurs silently without user awareness. No other malicious actions such as code injection, backdoors, or data theft from sensitive sources are evident. The code appears to be designed for tracking or exfiltrating system details, which could be malicious depending on context.",
  "conclusion": "This code potentially performs unauthorized data collection and transmission to malicious domains, indicating malicious or tracking behavior. It does not contain obfuscated code or other malicious payloads, but the external communication and data sent suggest malicious intent.",
