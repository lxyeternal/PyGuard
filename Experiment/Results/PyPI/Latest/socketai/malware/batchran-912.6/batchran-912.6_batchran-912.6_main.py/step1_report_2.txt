  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send data to external URLs",
  "flows": "Data from sources (hostname, username, current_path, rd_num) flows into URL parameters and is sent over network via urlopen()",
  "anomalies": "The code gathers system info and transmits it without user consent; URLs are suspicious and are not standard analytics endpoints; the use of multiple potentially malicious domains suggests data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, and current working directory, then generates a random number. It constructs URLs with these parameters and attempts to fetch them, logging responses or errors. The external domains are non-standard and could be malicious. No user input validation is present, and data is sent to multiple remote domains without any apparent user permission or context. The code appears designed to exfiltrate system information covertly, which is suspicious behavior typical of data theft or backdoor activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be exfiltrating system information to suspicious external domains without user consent, indicating potentially malicious activity. The absence of any user interaction or explicit purpose further supports this. Overall, it has a high malicious behavior score and security concern.",
