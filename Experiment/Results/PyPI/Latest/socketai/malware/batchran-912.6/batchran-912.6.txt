      "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high-risk pattern of executing external code during installation, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The current scores in the reports are reasonable but should be elevated to reflect the inherent danger. The pattern warrants caution and further review of 'main.py' before trusting or deploying this package."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, representing malicious behavior. While it lacks payloads or obfuscation, the privacy invasion and data transmission justify a high malware risk. The malware score should be set around 0.75, and the security risk score around 0.8, reflecting the significant threat posed by this activity."
