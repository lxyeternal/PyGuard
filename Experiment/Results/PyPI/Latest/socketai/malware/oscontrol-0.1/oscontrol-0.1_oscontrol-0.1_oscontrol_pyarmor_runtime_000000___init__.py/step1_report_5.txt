{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime component for code obfuscation or protection purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external data transmission observed",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks; code only performs an import",
  "anomalies": "Presence of comment indicating trial version and expiration date, which may suggest potential licensing or obfuscation tactics but not malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific module '__pyarmor__' from a relative package, likely part of the Pyarmor obfuscation tool. The comment indicates this is from a trial version with an expiration date. The code itself is minimal and standard for obfuscation or runtime protection purposes. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors, is evident. The only noteworthy aspect is the trial comment, which relates to licensing, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement related to the Pyarmor obfuscation tool, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The comment indicates a trial version, but this does not impact security.",
