{
  "purpose": "Import of __pyarmor__ from a local module, likely related to code obfuscation or runtime protection using Pyarmor.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no network or file system sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows; static import without dynamic execution or data processing",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating Pyarmor 9.0.6 (trial) and an expiration date; minimal code structure; no obfuscation beyond the comment",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a local module, accompanied by a comment indicating usage of Pyarmor in trial mode. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The import is static, with no data flows or dynamic code execution. The comment suggests the use of a code protection tool but does not imply malicious intent. The minimal code and standard import pattern indicate low security risk. The comments about trial licensing are typical and do not affect security. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated near 0, security risk near 0.1) are appropriate; minor adjustments could lower the risk slightly but are not necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard import for a protected or obfuscated Python module using Pyarmor. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The comments about trial licensing are normal and do not indicate any security concern. Overall, the code poses negligible security risk and is safe to use.",
