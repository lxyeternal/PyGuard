  "purpose": "The code imports the '__pyarmor__' runtime component, likely for code obfuscation or licensing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.pyarmor_runtime' module",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data processing, output, or network communication present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified; the code only performs an import",
  "anomalies": "Presence of Pyarmor trial version comment, which indicates use of an obfuscation tool; no suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a component related to Pyarmor, a legitimate obfuscation tool. No input sources, data leaks, or malicious commands are present. No complex logic or external data handling is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard import statement associated with code obfuscation or licensing via Pyarmor. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
