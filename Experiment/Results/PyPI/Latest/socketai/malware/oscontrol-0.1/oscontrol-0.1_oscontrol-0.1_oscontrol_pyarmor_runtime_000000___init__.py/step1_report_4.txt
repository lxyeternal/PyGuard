{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ attribute from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for runtime protection or obfuscation management.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __pyarmor__ from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks present in the code",
  "flows": "Import statement as a source leading to use within the runtime environment (not visible in this snippet)",
  "anomalies": "Presence of Pyarmor trial version comment, no malicious code or suspicious patterns observed; code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports a component (__pyarmor__) from a local module (pyarmor_runtime). There are no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or obfuscated code present. The comment indicates use of Pyarmor trial, which is a legitimate obfuscation/protection tool. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior are detected within this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement related to Pyarmor obfuscation/runtime, with no malicious behavior or security concerns observed.",
