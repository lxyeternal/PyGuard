  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ module from the local pyarmor_runtime package, likely for runtime protection or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local package 'pyarmor_runtime'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leakage or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; import is static.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicating 'Pyarmor 9.0.6 (trial)' and a date appears to be metadata or version info; no unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement for the '__pyarmor__' object from the 'pyarmor_runtime' module, likely used for runtime protection or licensing. The presence of a version comment suggests it was generated or used in a protected environment. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no external data sources, or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement for a protected runtime module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
