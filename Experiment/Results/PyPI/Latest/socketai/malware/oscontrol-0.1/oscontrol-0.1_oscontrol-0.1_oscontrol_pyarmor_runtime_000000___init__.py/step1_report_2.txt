  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module for obfuscation or runtime protection purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __pyarmor__ from the local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a comment indicating it is part of Pyarmor with a trial license, which suggests usage of obfuscation/packaging tools but not malicious behavior. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __pyarmor__ runtime, which is typically used for code obfuscation or protection. The presence of a trial license comment suggests this is part of an obfuscation or licensing scheme rather than malicious activity. There are no data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. The code is minimal and standard for protected Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement associated with Pyarmor obfuscation tools, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a protected codebase but does not pose a security threat on its own.",
