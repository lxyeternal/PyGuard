  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Pyarmor runtime loader used for script protection and licensing enforcement. The embedded binary data is typical for such tools and does not indicate malicious activity. The low malware score and high obfuscation score are justified. No signs of supply chain sabotage or malicious payloads are evident in this fragment."
