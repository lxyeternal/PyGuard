{
  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata for distribution using setuptools, with no dynamic or external input processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only contains static metadata in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script is static and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports only standard functions from setuptools and calls setup() with fixed parameters. It contains no external input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is a typical setup.py used in Python packaging, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. Multiple independent reviews confirm its benign nature, assigning scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's static and straightforward structure supports these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
