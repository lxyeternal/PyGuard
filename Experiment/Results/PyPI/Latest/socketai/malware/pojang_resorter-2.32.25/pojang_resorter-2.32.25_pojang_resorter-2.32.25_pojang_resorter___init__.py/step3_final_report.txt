  "purpose": "Minimal package initialization script defining metadata and importing main functionality.",
  "sources": "Import from local module '.main', metadata variables '__version__' and '__author__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package module, setting version and author info, and importing a main function. It contains no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No malicious indicators, obfuscation, or security risks are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and standard structure support the conclusion of no malicious intent or security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
