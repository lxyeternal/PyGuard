{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool",
  "sources": "Imports 'main' from the local module '.main'",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no untrusted data handling observed",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code only includes a package docstring, metadata (__version__ and __author__), and an import statement for 'main'. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or other code that could indicate malicious intent. The import is from a local module, which is typical for package entry points. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, primarily defining package metadata and importing the main function. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
