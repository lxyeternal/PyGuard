{
  "purpose": "Provides the main entry point and metadata for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module, metadata variables (__version__, __author__)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data outputs, network connections, or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identifiable; code primarily sets metadata and imports main function",
  "anomalies": "Lack of additional code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code or unusual patterns; minimal structure, but no suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports a main function from a local module. No input sources, data flows, or sinks are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for a Python package's __init__.py file. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. It is a typical module setup with no embedded code that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization file with no malicious or suspicious elements. It only sets metadata and imports a main function, posing no security risk.",
