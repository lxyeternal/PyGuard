  "purpose": "Decode and execute base64-encoded, zlib-compressed payload.",
  "sources": "Input data is a large base64-encoded string reversed and hardcoded within the lambda function.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decompressed payload, which could be malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code reverses the string, base64-decodes it, decompresses it, then executes the result.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string reversal before decoding, dynamic execution via exec() of a large payload; no validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that imports zlib and base64, reverses a hardcoded string, decodes it from base64, then decompresses it. The decompressed data is then executed directly with exec(). The payload appears to be obfuscated and is intended to hide its true purpose. The use of dynamic execution and data obfuscation are suspicious. No external inputs are read, but the payload itself could perform malicious actions once decompressed and executed. This pattern is common in malicious code attempting to hide payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to execute an obfuscated payload loaded from a hardcoded string, which strongly suggests malicious intent or at least obfuscated behavior. Given the typical use of such techniques for malicious purposes, this code is highly suspicious.",
