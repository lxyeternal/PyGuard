  "purpose": "Accepts a username via command-line argument and prints a message indicating privilege assignment.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument 'username' input",
  "sinks": "Print statement output",
  "flows": "Input from command-line argument -> assign_operator() -> print message",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple script that takes a username input and prints a message. It does not perform any privilege escalation, system modifications, or malicious activities. No hardcoded credentials, external communications, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0-0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature. Slightly elevated risk scores are due to potential misuse in broader contexts, but the code itself is safe. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and safe. The scores assigned are justified and consistent with its behavior. No malicious intent or security risks are present. The script only prints a message and does not perform any privilege escalation or malicious actions.",
