  "flows": "Command-line input 'username' flows into assign_operator() and then to print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious code, and no malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts a username from the command line and prints a message indicating assignment of operator privileges. There are no external data transmissions, no credential storage, or system modifications. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or suspicious code patterns. It appears to be a simple utility function without hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic command-line utility for assigning privileges with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain vulnerabilities.",
