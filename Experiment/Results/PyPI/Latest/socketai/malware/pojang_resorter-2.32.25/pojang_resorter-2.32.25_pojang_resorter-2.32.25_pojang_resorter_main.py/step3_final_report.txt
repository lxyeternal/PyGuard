  "purpose": "This script functions as a command-line interface dispatcher for server management commands, executing scripts or functions based on user input.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse; uses subprocess to execute external scripts; imports functions from external modules ('forceop', 'nukeserver') based on commands.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing external scripts; imported functions invoked from modules; passing arguments directly to scripts/functions.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> command mapping -> subprocess execution or function import -> execution of external scripts or functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation or hidden code; external modules ('forceop', 'nukeserver') could be malicious if compromised; no input sanitization beyond predefined choices; powerful commands ('nukeserver', 'assign_operator') pose security risks if external modules are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a dispatcher for server commands, executing scripts or functions based on user input. It employs a command map to restrict commands and uses subprocess for script execution, reducing some risk. However, reliance on external modules ('forceop', 'nukeserver') introduces potential security concerns if those modules are malicious or compromised. The commands 'nukeserver' and 'assign_operator' are powerful and could be destructive if misused. No obfuscation or malicious code is present within this script. The security risk primarily stems from external dependencies and the potential for malicious modules/scripts, not from the code itself. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. The security risk score should be moderate (~0.4) to reflect the potential danger posed by external modules and powerful commands, but the code itself remains benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward command dispatcher with no malicious or obfuscated code. Its security posture depends on the trustworthiness of external modules ('forceop', 'nukeserver') and scripts. The main risks involve external dependencies and the potential for malicious modules to execute harmful actions. The current scoring aligns with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and a moderate risk score (~0.4). Proper validation and integrity checks of external modules are recommended to mitigate potential threats.",
