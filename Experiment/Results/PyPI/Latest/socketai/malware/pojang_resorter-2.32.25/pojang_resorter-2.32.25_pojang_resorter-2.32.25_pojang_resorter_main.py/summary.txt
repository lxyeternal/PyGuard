  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward command dispatcher with no malicious or obfuscated code. Its security posture depends on the trustworthiness of external modules ('forceop', 'nukeserver') and scripts. The main risks involve external dependencies and the potential for malicious modules to execute harmful actions. The current scoring aligns with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and a moderate risk score (~0.4). Proper validation and integrity checks of external modules are recommended to mitigate potential threats."
