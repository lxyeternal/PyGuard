  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration defining dependencies, entry points, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Dependencies listed in 'install_requires' and the 'entry_points' specification.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data sinks; dependencies may fetch or execute code during installation or runtime, but not within this script.",
  "flows": "Dependencies could potentially fetch or execute code during installation or runtime, but the setup script itself only defines configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It specifies dependencies related to GUI automation, image processing, HTTP requests, and testing, all of which are common and legitimate. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The entry point indicates a CLI script, but no dynamic or network activity occurs within this script. The dependencies could, in theory, be exploited if malicious packages are introduced, but the setup code itself remains benign. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk scores (0 or 0.1-0.2) reflecting potential risks associated with dependencies rather than the setup script itself.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the potential for dependencies to be malicious if compromised, but the script itself is safe.",
