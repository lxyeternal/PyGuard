{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pojang_resorter' Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The package dependencies listed in 'install_requires' and the 'entry_points' for CLI execution.",
  "sinks": "Dependencies may fetch external code or data; entry point executes 'pojang_resorter.main:main' which could run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Dependencies may introduce external data into the environment; the entry point runs a main function that could contain untrusted code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of common packages without suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports 'setuptools' and specifies package configuration, dependencies, and entry points typical of Python packages. All listed dependencies are standard packages used for GUI automation, image processing, HTTP requests, and testing. There are no signs of malicious code, such as obfuscated scripts, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. The entry point indicates a command-line script but does not provide the implementation details. Overall, this is a typical setup file for a legitimate package.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python package setup script with common dependencies and no apparent malicious behavior. No suspicious activity or malware indicators are present.",
