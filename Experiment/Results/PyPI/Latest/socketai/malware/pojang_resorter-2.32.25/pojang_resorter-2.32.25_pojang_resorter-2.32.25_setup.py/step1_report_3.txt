{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pojang_resorter', specifying its dependencies, entry points, and Python version requirements.",
  "sources": "The setup parameters such as 'install_requires', 'entry_points', and version specifications.",
  "sinks": "N/A — the code does not perform runtime actions that process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "N/A — this is a static configuration script, not runtime code with data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. All dependencies listed are common for GUI automation and image processing, consistent with the package's purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard 'setuptools' to configure package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All listed dependencies are typical for automation, image processing, and HTTP communication. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no dynamic execution, obfuscated parts, or hidden behaviors. The package's dependencies and entry points suggest legitimate functionality related to GUI automation or image manipulation, with no indication of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package setup script.",
