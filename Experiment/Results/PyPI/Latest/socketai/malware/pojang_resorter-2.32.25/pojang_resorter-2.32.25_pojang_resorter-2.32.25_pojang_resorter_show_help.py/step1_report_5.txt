{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface (CLI) for a Python-based Mojang interaction tool, displaying help information with stylized ASCII art and color formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine user commands.",
  "sinks": "None. The code outputs help information but does not process or output untrusted data beyond the predefined help text.",
  "flows": "Command-line inputs flow from argparse to command dispatch; no untrusted data is used in sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. Usage of ASCII art and color formatting is purely aesthetic. The code does not perform any network, file, or system modifications. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes the colorama library for colored terminal output, defines a function to display stylized help content with ASCII art, and sets up command-line argument parsing with subcommands. It outputs help information with colorful ASCII art and does not process or execute untrusted data. There are no inputs from external sources that influence code behavior beyond standard CLI argument parsing. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI help display utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is purely to present styled help information for a command-line tool.",
