{
  "purpose": "Display stylized help information with ASCII art and colored command descriptions for a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsed via argparse; static ASCII art and text output.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks; purely static display.",
  "flows": "Input (command-line args) parsed but not used to execute actions; only help display triggered.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI help utility that initializes colorama, defines a function to print ASCII art and command descriptions with colors, and calls this function in main. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The use of 'argparse' and 'colorama' is standard, and the ASCII art is static. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are present. The code's purpose is purely aesthetic and informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves as a help display utility with static content. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
