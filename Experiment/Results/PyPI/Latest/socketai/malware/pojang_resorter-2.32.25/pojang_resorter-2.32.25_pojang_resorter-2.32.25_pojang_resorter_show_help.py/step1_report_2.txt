{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface (CLI) help menu with ASCII art and colorized command descriptions for a Python tool related to Mojang interaction.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine user commands.",
  "sinks": "None of the command arguments or outputs directly process or execute untrusted data; no data sinks or external calls are evident.",
  "flows": "User input via command-line arguments flows into argparse parsing, which then determines which help or command info to display. No further data flow to other modules or external systems is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; ASCII art and color usage are purely for display purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a CLI with help messages and ASCII art, using argparse for command handling. It imports 'colorama' for colored terminal output, initializes it, and displays a stylized help message with ASCII art and colored text. The command definitions are standard and do not include any dynamic or unsafe code execution. No external network, file operations, or untrusted data handling is present. The code is straightforward and does not contain malicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign CLI help display tool with no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It appears to be a standard utility for user guidance with stylized output.",
