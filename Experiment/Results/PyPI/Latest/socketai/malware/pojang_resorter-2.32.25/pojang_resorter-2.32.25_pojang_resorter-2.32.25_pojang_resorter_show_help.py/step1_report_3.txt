{
  "purpose": "Provides a CLI tool that displays help information with ASCII art and colored text for a Python-Mojang interaction utility.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments to determine subcommands; reads ASCII art string for display.",
  "takes": "User input from command-line arguments via argparse.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments (sources) are processed by argparse; then the ASCII art and command descriptions are printed to stdout (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The code mainly focuses on UI/UX with ASCII art and command help display.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'argparse' and 'colorama', initializes colorama for colored terminal output, and defines a function 'show_help()' that displays ASCII art and help information with color formatting. It defines several subcommands but does not perform any actions beyond displaying help text. There is no user input processing beyond argument parsing, no external data fetching, no data leaks, and no security-sensitive operations. The code appears solely focused on presenting user interface elements for CLI usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless CLI help display utility with ASCII art and colored text. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It is designed for user interaction and presentation only.",
