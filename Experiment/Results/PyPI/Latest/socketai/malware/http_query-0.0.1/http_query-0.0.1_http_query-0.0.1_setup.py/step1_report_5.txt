{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'http_query' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry point.",
  "sources": "Read from 'setuptools', 'os.path', and package configuration data within the script.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or external communication appears in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The comment in the description is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and os.path, then defines package metadata and configuration for building/distributing the package. The entry point defines a console script. No code execution, network communication, or data handling occurs at runtime. The license, author info, and description are static and benign. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It contains no malware indicators, no obfuscated code, and does not perform any unsafe operations. The comment about 'please dont install it, its a demo library' is likely benign and intended as a joke or warning, not malicious.",
