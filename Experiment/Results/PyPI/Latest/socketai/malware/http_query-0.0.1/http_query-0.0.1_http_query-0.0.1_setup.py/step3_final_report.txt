  "purpose": "Define package metadata and entry points for the 'http_query' Python library.",
  "sources": "Static code in setup() function, including package name, version, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual comment in description: 'please dont install it, its a demo library', but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It imports 'setuptools' and 'os.path', defines package metadata, dependencies, and an entry point. No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The only unusual element is the description comment, which appears to be a placeholder or joke. All reports agree that the code is benign, with malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0. The security risk scores are very low (~0.1), justified by the benign static configuration and the minor oddity of the comment. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The unusual comment does not impact security. Scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a very low risk score, are appropriate and justified.",
