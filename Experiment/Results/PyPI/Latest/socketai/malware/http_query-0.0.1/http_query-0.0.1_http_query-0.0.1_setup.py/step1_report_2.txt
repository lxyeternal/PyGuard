  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and installing the 'http_query' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, and entry point definitions from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script only defines static configuration for package setup.",
  "flows": "N/A – the script does not process external input or untrusted data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "The description field contains a suspicious message: 'please dont install it, its a demo library', which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a standard Python package setup configuration, including package name, version, metadata, dependencies, and entry points. There are no dynamic or insecure code patterns. The comment in the description is unusual but not harmful. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain attacks is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. The unusual description message is likely a benign note. No malware or security concerns identified.",
