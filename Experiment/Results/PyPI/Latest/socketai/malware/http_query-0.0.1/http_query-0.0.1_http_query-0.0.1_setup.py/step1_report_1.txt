  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or data output points that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only sets up package metadata and does not process external or untrusted data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Comment within description field ('please dont install it, its a demo library') is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script defining package information and dependencies. It contains no dynamic code execution, no input/output handling, and no network activity. The comment in the description appears to be a harmless note. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are observed. The script's purpose is purely to package the library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The comment might suggest caution, but it does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe.",
