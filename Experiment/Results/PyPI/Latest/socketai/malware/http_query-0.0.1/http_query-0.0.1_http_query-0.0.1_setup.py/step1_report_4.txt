  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and installing the 'http_query' Python library, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from static strings, defines entry point for console script, imports 'setuptools' and 'os' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution or network operations present in this script.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script only defines package configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "Comment 'please dont install it, its a demo library' is unusual and potentially suspicious but does not affect code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and uses static strings to configure the package. It defines metadata, dependencies, and a console script entry point. There are no indications of malicious code, data leaks, or dynamic behavior. The comment is odd but harmless. No sources lead to sinks, and there are no anomalies or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. The odd comment does not impact security. Overall, the code appears safe.",
