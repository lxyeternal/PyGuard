  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious activities.",
  "sources": "Input data read via functions, environment variables, network calls, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), and file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through network transmission, file writes, or environment variable access; dynamic code execution points that could lead to malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input functions or environment reads flow into processing logic; if combined with eval/exec or network transmission, these constitute potential malicious flows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution without validation, hardcoded secrets, misleading variable names, or unusual import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in most reports, with low obfuscation and no suspicious sinks. Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating potential malicious intent, warranting a higher malware and risk score. Other reports are straightforward, with no anomalies. The scores are consistent with the observed behaviors, with Report 2's elevated scores justified by its signs of obfuscation and dynamic code usage. Confidence levels reflect the certainty based on code patterns; no evidence suggests false positives. Overall, the code appears low risk, with isolated suspicion in one report.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low malware and risk scores. Report 2's signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution justify moderate suspicion, leading to higher scores. The assessments are consistent and appropriate; no significant adjustments are necessary.",
