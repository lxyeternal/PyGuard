{
  "purpose": "The code executes a custom installation step that imports and runs main() from main.py during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "The run() method in CrazyInstallStrat class, which imports main and calls main() during setup.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() during install, which can run arbitrary code from main.py.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code flow is: install.run() -> import main -> main() execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external code during setup, which is atypical and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code pattern involves executing main() from main.py during setup, which could be exploited if main.py contains malicious code. The behavior is consistent across reports. The suspicion level is moderate; no obfuscation or secrets are present. The scores assigned (malware ~0.4-0.5, security risk ~0.6) are appropriate given the pattern. The main risk is executing arbitrary code during install, a known supply chain attack vector. Further inspection of main.py is necessary to confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script's behavior of executing main() during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, depending on main.py's content. The scores reflect moderate suspicion and risk, which are justified. No obfuscation detected. Caution is advised, and further review of main.py is recommended before trusting or deploying this package.",
