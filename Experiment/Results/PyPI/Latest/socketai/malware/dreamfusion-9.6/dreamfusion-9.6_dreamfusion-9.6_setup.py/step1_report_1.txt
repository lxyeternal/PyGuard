{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'dreamfusion' package, including a custom installation step that executes a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own modules (setuptools, setuptools.command.install, and main.py). The main.py import occurs during the custom install command execution.",
  "sinks": "The import of main and invocation of main() function after installation can execute arbitrary code, which could be malicious if main.py contains malicious logic.",
  "flows": "During installation, the CrazyInstallStrat class's run method calls main() from main.py, creating a source-to-sink flow where arbitrary code can be executed.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes code from main.py unconditionally during installation, which is unusual and potentially suspicious. No visible hardcoded secrets, but executing main() automatically is notable.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation command CrazyInstallStrat that, after standard installation, imports and executes main() from main.py. This behavior could execute malicious code if main.py contains harmful logic. The code uses standard setup practices, but the automatic execution of main() during install is atypical and warrants suspicion. No obfuscated code or external data sources are present. The code relies on the assumption that main.py exists and contains benign code, but this behavior could be exploited to run malicious scripts at install time.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a potentially malicious action during installation by calling main() from main.py automatically. While this could be benign if main.py is safe, such behavior is suspicious and could be used to execute malicious code during package installation, representing a security risk.",
