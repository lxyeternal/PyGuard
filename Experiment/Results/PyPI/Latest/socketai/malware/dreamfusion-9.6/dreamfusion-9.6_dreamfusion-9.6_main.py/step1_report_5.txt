  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs with encoded MAC addresses.",
  "sources": "Platform and OS functions (platform.system(), platform.node()), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system commands, random.randint(), base64 encoding MAC addresses, URL parameters encoding.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send GET requests with sensitive information to external URLs.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, encoded MAC addresses) is gathered, URL parameters are constructed and sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated, suspicious domains, URL pattern involving 'oast' (commonly used for testing), MAC addresses are base64 encoded and sent to external servers, no clear user or system benefit; code communicates externally without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system details including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses via system commands. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and constructs URLs with these details as GET parameters, then attempts to send HTTP requests to third-party URLs. The URLs appear suspicious, possibly for tracking or data exfiltration. The code does not perform any harmful actions directly but collects and transmits sensitive system info to external servers, which could be malicious if used without user consent. No hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads are present, but the external communication and data collection are suspicious. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the purpose seems to be covert data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be collecting system information and exfiltrating it to external domains. While it doesn't contain overt malware like system damage or unauthorized control, its behavior of sending system identifiers to suspicious URLs without user knowledge indicates malicious intent or at least malicious risk. The overall security risk is moderate due to potential privacy invasion and data leakage.",
