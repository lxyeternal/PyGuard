  "purpose": "Collect system information (host, user, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to remote URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() (which reads system network interfaces), and the hardcoded URLs.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send HTTP GET requests with encoded system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info sources are encoded and appended as URL parameters, then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to remote domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for MAC addresses; hardcoded URLs with suspicious domains; dynamic URL construction with random number; no validation or encryption of data; minimal error handling.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system info including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses across Windows, Linux, and macOS. The MAC addresses are serialized as strings, base64-encoded, and sent to multiple remote URLs via GET requests with query parameters. The URLs appear suspicious, indicating possible data exfiltration. No input validation or encryption is used, and the code silently ignores errors during transmission. The purpose seems to be gathering and transmitting device info, potentially without user consent, with no clear benign use. No malware signatures such as system damage, remote code execution, or backdoors are detected, but the data collection and transmission pattern is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect detailed system information and send it to remote servers, potentially for malicious or privacy-invading purposes. The use of obfuscated URLs and data encoding, combined with silent error handling, raises concerns about covert data exfiltration. There are no direct indicators of malware such as system damage, but the behavior aligns with reconnaissance or data theft activities. The overall security risk is high due to data transmission to suspicious domains.",
