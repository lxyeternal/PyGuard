  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to remote URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), MAC addresses (via subprocess calls), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Network requests made via urllib.request.urlopen to external URLs with query parameters containing collected data.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, random number) encoded and sent via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple external URLs with suspicious domain names, encodes MAC addresses in base64 before transmission, and makes network requests without any validation or encryption. The URLs appear to be potentially malicious or used for tracking, and no response handling or validation occurs. The code's purpose to silently transmit system info to remote servers is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system details including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends requests without handling responses. The URLs are suspicious, potentially malicious domains, possibly used for tracking or data exfiltration. The code does not perform any harmful operations directly but appears designed to collect and transmit system information covertly. The use of base64 encoding and the nature of URLs indicate potential malicious intent, such as tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious and potentially malicious, designed to silently gather and transmit system information to external servers. Although it doesn't perform destructive actions, its behavior aligns with data exfiltration or tracking activities, which warrants caution.",
