{
  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple remote URLs for tracking or data collection purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system details (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), gathers MAC addresses via subprocess calls, and encodes data in base64 before transmitting.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests to external URLs with query parameters containing system info, potentially leaking sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Collects system data -> encodes MAC addresses -> constructs URLs with parameters -> sends data via urllib.request.urlopen() to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated or suspicious hostnames and URLs that are not typical for legitimate software; encodes MAC addresses in base64 possibly to obscure data; no authentication or validation of server responses; no user consent prompts.",
  "analysis": "The code collects potentially sensitive system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, then transmitted via GET requests to third-party URLs that appear suspicious and likely malicious due to their unusual domain names and obfuscation. No safeguards or encryption are used for data in transit besides simple base64 encoding. The code’s intent seems to be tracking or potentially malicious data exfiltration. The URLs do not belong to legitimate or well-known services, raising concern about malicious intent. The code does not perform any malicious actions like damaging files or establishing reverse shells but is covertly transmitting system info, which is suspicious. The overall behavior indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, with data exfiltration being a core feature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to gather and transmit system information covertly to suspicious external servers, indicating malicious intent focused on data collection and potential privacy invasion. It should be considered malicious based on its behavior, obfuscated hostnames, and data exfiltration patterns.",
