  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionary behavior and a simple lookup dictionary used in the requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), dictionary access methods (__getitem__, get), and update methods (update).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly evident; no untrusted data is being sent to external systems, no code injection points or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from initial inputs into dictionary objects, with no transformations leading to external effects or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward implementation of data structures with no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict, which is a case-insensitive dict-like object that preserves the last-cased key, and LookupDict, which is a simple dict subclass with a custom __repr__ and __getitem__ implementation. Both classes use standard Python collections and do not perform any network operations, code execution, or access external resources. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code mainly manages in-memory data structures with no external side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard data structure implementation with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions to support request headers and lookup operations in the requests library, with no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
