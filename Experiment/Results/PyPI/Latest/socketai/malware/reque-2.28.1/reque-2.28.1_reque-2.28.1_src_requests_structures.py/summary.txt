  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor bug in the copy() method does not impact security but could be fixed for correctness. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
