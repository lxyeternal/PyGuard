  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes cookie utilities, standard sources, no suspicious elements.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly states the code is benign, standard, with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Risk Score = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The low security risk and malware scores are appropriate given the benign description. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for cookie management, standard sources.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Confirms benign utility code, no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Risk Score = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Scores are consistent with the benign description.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, standard cookie handling.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, benign utility code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Risk Score = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions, with a note about potential data leaks if sensitive info is stored in cookies.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, standard cookie handling.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Risk Score = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) due to potential data leakage via cookies is reasonable, but no actual leak is present. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions, standard sources.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, standard cookie management.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Risk Score = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The scores are consistent with the benign nature described.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, standard code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1 or 0.2) in some reports due to potential data leakage or security considerations, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk Score:** ~0.1 (minimal, based on potential data leakage, but no actual risk observed)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and their scores are justified. The code is standard, benign utility code for cookie management with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
