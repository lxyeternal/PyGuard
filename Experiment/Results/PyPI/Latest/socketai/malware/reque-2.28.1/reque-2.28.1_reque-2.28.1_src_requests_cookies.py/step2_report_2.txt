  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and compare their findings with the code to identify any inconsistencies, potential risks, or anomalies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as a standard utility for cookie management, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies the code as benign and standard. The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The security risk is low, considering the code handles cookies but does not perform any network or system modifications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing utility functions without malicious intent.  \n- **Confidence:** 1  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis aligns with the code's purpose. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The malware and security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the benign nature, standard cookie handling, and no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Confidence:** 1  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous findings. The code is a utility module with no malicious features.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on potential data leaks via cookie data but notes no explicit network activity or malicious behavior.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.95  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nWhile it mentions potential data leaks, it correctly concludes that no malicious activity is present. The low security risk score reflects the benign nature, and malware remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes the code as a standard, safe utility for cookie management, with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Confidence:** 1  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent with the overall benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Code Content:**  \n  The code implements cookie handling utilities, including extraction, creation, merging, and header generation. All functions and classes are standard, with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or network activity.\n\n- **Presence of Malware:**  \n  The malware scores across all reports are 0, which is justified given the absence of any malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Security Risks:**  \n  The security risk scores are very low (0 to 0.2), which is appropriate. The only mention of potential data leaks is theoretical, but no actual leak or malicious data exfiltration is present.\n\n- **Scores Consistency:**  \n  All reports' scores are consistent with their analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Already at **0**; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a conservative estimate would be around **0.1**, accounting for the fact that cookies can contain sensitive data, but the code itself does not perform risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                | No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior present. |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                | Code is clear, well-structured, and standard.               |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1              | Minimal risk; handles cookies but no direct security threat. |\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign utility module for cookie management with no signs of malware or malicious intent.**",
