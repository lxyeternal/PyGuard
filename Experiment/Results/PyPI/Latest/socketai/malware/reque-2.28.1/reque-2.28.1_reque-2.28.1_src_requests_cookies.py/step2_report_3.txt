  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report, verify the code's behavior, and assess the scoring and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard cookie utilities; sources are request headers, URL parsing, cookie data structures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data sinks; flows are typical cookie extraction, header creation, and storage.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Uses standard libraries and functions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard utility code; high confidence (0.9). Obfuscated: 0, malware: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code does not contain any malicious behavior.  \n- The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate given its utility nature.  \n- The malware score (0) is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing utility functions for cookie management, no malicious patterns, and standard practices.  \n- Confidence is 1, malware is 0, risk is 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on cookie extraction, header generation, and jar manipulation.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious activity.  \n- Confidence: 1, malware: 0, risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code remains standard, safe, and free of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Highlights cookie extraction, creation, and management.  \n- Notes potential data leaks if cookies contain sensitive info but clarifies no network activity or leaks are evident.  \n- Confidence: 0.95, malware: 0, risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Slightly cautious due to potential data leak concerns, but the code does not actively leak data.  \n- The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar to others, describing utility functions for cookie handling.  \n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.  \n- Confidence: 1, malware: 0, risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is benign, with standard cookie management functions.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, consistent with the code's purpose as a cookie utility module.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1-0.2), justified by the potential for data leaks if cookies contain sensitive info, but no actual leaks or malicious activity are present.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, due to potential data sensitivity, but no actual vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent with the code's actual behavior. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified. The code is a standard, well-implemented cookie management utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
