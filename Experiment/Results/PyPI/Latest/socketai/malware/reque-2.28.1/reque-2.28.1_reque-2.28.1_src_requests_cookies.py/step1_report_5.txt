{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and utility functions for handling cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, management, and conversion.",
  "sources": "Reading request URL, headers, and cookie attributes; accessing response headers and message objects; reading cookie parameters and cookie dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Adding headers to requests, extracting cookies into jars, converting cookies to headers, and updating or removing cookies in cookie jars.",
  "flows": "Request URL and headers are used to generate request mock objects; response headers are parsed to extract cookies; cookies are created, updated, or removed in cookie jars; cookie headers are generated for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code. The code mostly consists of standard cookie handling operations with no obfuscation or unusual constructs. The only notable aspect is the comprehensive handling of cookies including compatibility features.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility classes and functions for cookie management, including wrappers for request and response objects to interface with cookie handling libraries, cookie extraction from responses, cookie creation, and manipulation functions. It uses standard modules like 'calendar', 'time', and 'copy', and standard practices for cookie handling. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity are present. The code does not perform any actions outside normal cookie management operations, and no hardcoded secrets or credentials are observed. The structure and logic are consistent with common cookie handling implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie compatibility and management functions for the requests library. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies. It appears safe and intended solely for cookie handling.",
