  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for managing HTTP cookies within the requests library, including extraction, creation, merging, and header handling.",
  "sources": "Request headers, URL parsing, cookie data structures, response headers.",
  "sinks": "Cookie storage, header generation, cookie extraction into jar.",
  "flows": "Request URL and headers → Cookie extraction and header creation → CookieJar storage and retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie management utilities compatible with requests and urllib. It includes classes for request and response mocking, cookie extraction, creation, and manipulation. All functions follow typical patterns without obfuscation or malicious behavior. The security implications are minimal, primarily related to cookie handling, which is inherently sensitive but not malicious here. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code is well-structured, clear, and relies on standard libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for cookie handling with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
