  "purpose": "Provide the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from certifi import where",
  "sinks": "Print statement: print(where())",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where() -> print() outputs the CA bundle location",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution; the code simply retrieves and displays a certificate bundle path.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library function from the well-known certifi package to obtain the default CA bundle location. It then outputs this path when executed as a script. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code's purpose is benign, and it uses standard practices for managing CA certificates.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward utility to display the default CA bundle path. There is no malicious behavior or security risk evident in this code.",
