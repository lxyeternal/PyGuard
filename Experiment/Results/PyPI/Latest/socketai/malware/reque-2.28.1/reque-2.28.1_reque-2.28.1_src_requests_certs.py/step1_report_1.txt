{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility to output the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package, mainly for use in packaging or environment configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The output of the script (the path to the CA bundle) could be used by other processes; however, there are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The script imports the 'where' function from certifi, then calls it during execution, printing the result. No untrusted input flows into the code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from certifi, which returns the path to the trusted CA bundle. It then prints this path if run as the main module. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or actions that could be malicious. It appears to be a utility script for configuration purposes. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to output the certifi CA bundle path and contains no malicious intent or security risks. It performs a benign operation with no external data processing or insecure practices.",
