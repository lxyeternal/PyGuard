{
  "purpose": "This script provides the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for validating SSL connections.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'certifi' package through the import statement 'from certifi import where'.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The flow is: import 'where' from certifi -> execute 'print(where())' -> output the CA bundle path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and only outputs a known certificate bundle location. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function to determine the location of the CA bundle from the certifi package and prints this path when run as a standalone script. The code is simple, clean, and follows standard practices. There are no signs of malicious intent, hidden behaviors, or malicious code injection. The only functionality is to output a file path for SSL certificate validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and solely designed to report the CA bundle location used by the requests library. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
