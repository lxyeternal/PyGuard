  "purpose": "Outputs the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi'.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'print(where())', which is a file path string.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' -> call to 'where()' -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted function from a well-maintained library and prints its result. It performs a simple utility function with no user input, network activity, or data manipulation. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The purpose is to display the CA bundle path, which is standard and safe. The code's simplicity and reliance on trusted libraries indicate no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
