  "purpose": "To provide the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle location to standard output.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function retrieves the CA bundle path; this output could potentially be captured or redirected but does not lead to any security-sensitive action.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function from a well-known library (certifi) and prints its output. The function 'where' simply returns a path to a CA bundle file. The code is minimal, does not process untrusted input, and performs a standard operation without any obfuscated or suspicious code. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to display the default CA bundle path from certifi. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
