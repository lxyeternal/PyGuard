{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package, primarily for use in SSL/TLS verification in requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "Input from the certifi library -> Output via print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses standard library functions without any obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from certifi to determine the CA bundle location. When executed as a script, it prints this location. There are no user inputs, network connections, or data manipulations. The code is minimal and uses a well-known library for its purpose. No malicious behavior or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign utility that outputs the path to the trusted CA bundle. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code is straightforward and safe.",
