{
  "purpose": "The code implements request construction and response handling for an HTTP client library, managing URL encoding, headers, cookies, request bodies, and response parsing.",
  "sources": "URL parsing, header validation, cookie management, request body encoding, response reading and decoding.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted input influences URL, headers, cookies, and request bodies; response content is processed and decoded.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into URL, headers, cookies, and body; then over the network; response data flows back into response object for parsing and decoding.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; standard practices used throughout.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URL encoding with IDNA, header validation, cookie handling, JSON and multipart encoding, and response processing with error handling. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are present. The structure and logic are clear, with no obfuscation or hidden code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, well-maintained nature of the implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, secure implementation of an HTTP request/response handling library component. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage is evident. The low risk score is appropriate given its purpose and structure.",
