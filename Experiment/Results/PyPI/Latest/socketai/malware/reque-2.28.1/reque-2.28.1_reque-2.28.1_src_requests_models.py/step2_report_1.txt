  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles request construction and response processing, encoding URLs, headers, cookies, and bodies. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious activity are detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, justified given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with standard request/response handling, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard request/response logic, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Routine HTTP request/response code, no malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — still very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard implementation, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code being a standard HTTP client library.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting the low but non-zero potential for misuse if untrusted input is fed into the system. Given the code's purpose and the lack of malicious behavior, these are reasonable.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- Since the code is purely request/response handling with no malicious logic, I would suggest **keeping the malware scores at 0** and possibly lowering the risk scores to 0.0, emphasizing the minimal security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 for all reports, considering the benign nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an HTTP client library. No malicious, obfuscated, or sabotage behaviors are evident. The existing scores are reasonable, but I recommend setting the risk scores to zero to reflect the very low security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-step conclusion:**\n\n1. Confirmed no malicious code or obfuscation.\n2. Scores are appropriate but could be slightly lowered.\n3. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
