  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard compatibility and utility module for handling Python version differences, optional dependencies, and URL/character detection functions.\n- All reports agree that there are no suspicious behaviors, no data processing from untrusted sources, and no malicious patterns.\n- The code only performs imports, version checks, and simple function definitions, with fallback mechanisms for optional dependencies.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n**Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code appears clean, with no anomalies or security issues.\n- No untrusted data is processed.\n- No dynamic code execution or network activity.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The import resolution and compatibility checks are standard practice.\n\n**Scores and their reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- Confidence is 1, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- No reason exists; all evidence points to a benign, standard compatibility module.\n\n**Malware score:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All claims are well-supported; no assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is purely for compatibility and setup.\n- No external data is processed, no network activity, no secrets, no code injection.\n- All standard practices are followed, with fallback mechanisms for optional dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThis code is a benign, standard compatibility layer with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the detailed analysis and the consensus among the reports.",
