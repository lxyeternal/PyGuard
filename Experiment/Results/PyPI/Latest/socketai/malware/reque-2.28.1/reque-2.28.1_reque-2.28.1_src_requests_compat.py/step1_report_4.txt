{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility utilities and imports for handling character detection, JSON parsing, and URL operations across different Python versions, primarily for backward compatibility in the requests library.",
  "sources": "importlib for dynamic module import, sys for Python version info, standard library modules (collections, http, io, urllib) for imports, and the initial inline function _resolve_char_detection.",
  "sinks": "No sink points where untrusted data is processed; no network, file, or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code mainly sets up imports and compatibility functions without processing external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The code is straightforward, mainly imports and compatibility logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to dynamically import character detection libraries ('chardet' or 'charset_normalizer') and sets a variable accordingly. It detects Python version to set compatibility flags. It conditionally imports 'simplejson' or 'json' and defines error classes. Standard library modules are imported for URL, cookie, and collection handling. It also sets string and numeric type aliases. No input sources or data sinks are present. The code appears standard for a compatibility layer with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a compatibility and utility setup for the requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is safe and typical for such modules.",
