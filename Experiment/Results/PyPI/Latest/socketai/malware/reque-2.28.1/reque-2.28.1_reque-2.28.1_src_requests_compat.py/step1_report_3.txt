{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and for importing certain libraries like chardet, simplejson, and standard libraries.",
  "sources": "Reading module imports, sys.version_info, importlib.import_module, and the defined functions for library detection.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication; mainly import resolution and compatibility logic.",
  "flows": "Imports and version checks are static; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The code primarily sets up compatibility variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code does not include any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses on compatibility and import resolution, including dynamic importing of libraries (chardet, simplejson). All operations are standard and typical for maintaining backwards compatibility. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious logic detected. No obfuscation or malware-like activity. The use of importlib and version checks is normal for such utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard compatibility and import resolution module with no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks present. It mainly ensures compatibility across Python versions and handles optional dependencies.",
