{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility handling for Python 2 and 3, manages optional dependencies like 'chardet' and 'simplejson', and sets up URL and character detection functions for the 'requests' library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, optional libraries ('chardet', 'simplejson'), and version detection via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only performs imports, version checks, and function definitions without processing external input.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code does not process data flows; it only sets up environment and compatibility variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for compatibility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility and utility module for handling differences between Python 2 and 3, with optional dynamic imports for character detection and JSON handling. It performs no data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The import logic and version checks are standard and safe. There are no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate compatibility, and it does not introduce any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility layer with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
