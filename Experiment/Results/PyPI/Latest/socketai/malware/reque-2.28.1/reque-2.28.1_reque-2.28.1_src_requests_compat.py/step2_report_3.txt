  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is a standard compatibility and utility module.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The purpose is purely to provide compatibility across Python versions and handle optional dependencies.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The function `_resolve_char_detection()` dynamically imports optional character detection libraries (`chardet` or `charset_normalizer`). This is a common pattern and not malicious.\n- The code performs version checks, conditional imports, and defines compatibility variables—standard practices.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no external network calls, no data processing from untrusted sources.\n- The code is static, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious behavior, no code injection, no backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score (0):** No security risks identified; the code is a compatibility layer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate. The code is a typical, safe compatibility module with no security issues or malware. The scores assigned (0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate based on the code analysis.",
