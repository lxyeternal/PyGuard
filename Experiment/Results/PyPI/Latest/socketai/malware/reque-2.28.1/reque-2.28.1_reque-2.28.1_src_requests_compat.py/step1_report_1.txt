{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling encoding detection, Python version differences, and URL parsing in the requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries and optional third-party libraries (importlib, sys, simplejson, collections, http, io, urllib). No input sources such as user input, network, or environment variables are directly read in this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this code where untrusted data could lead to security vulnerabilities. The code only performs imports, version checks, and function definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations. The code's primary flow involves importing modules and setting up compatibility shims.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code consists of standard compatibility handling and module imports. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard library imports, version checks, and optional third-party library imports with fallback mechanisms. The function _resolve_char_detection() attempts to import optional character detection libraries, which is common in handling text encoding. No untrusted data is read or processed. No suspicious behaviors, malicious patterns, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical compatibility and utility module with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It serves its purpose without any potentially harmful behavior.",
