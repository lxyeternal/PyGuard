  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily sets up environment compatibility and imports",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. No malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes compatibility layers for Python 2 and 3, manages optional dependencies like simplejson, and sets up utility functions for URL handling and string types. All imports and functions are standard and do not perform any untrusted data processing or malicious actions. No indication of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is straightforward, focusing on environment setup.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard compatibility and utility setup code with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security risks. The code is safe for use.",
