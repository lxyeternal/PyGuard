{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and sets up environment for character detection and URL handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as importlib, sys, simplejson, json, collections, http, io, urllib, and built-in types; internal functions like _resolve_char_detection.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly uses untrusted input; it primarily imports modules and defines compatibility variables.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from external sources to sinks; the code is mainly setup and import logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code's structure is straightforward and typical for compatibility layers.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and handles optional dependencies (like simplejson), defining compatibility variables for Python versions. It resolves character detection libraries dynamically, which is common. There are no dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic present. The code appears to be a standard compatibility shim without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python compatibility module for older Python versions and character detection libraries. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and poses no security risks.",
