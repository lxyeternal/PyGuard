{
  "purpose": "Ensure backward compatibility by redirecting certain third-party modules to maintain consistent module identities across different versions.",
  "sources": "Modules imported via __import__ and existing modules in sys.modules, specifically 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet'.",
  "sinks": "Modifications to sys.modules that re-map package paths; no direct data leaks or security-sensitive operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are re-mapped into sys.modules under 'requests.packages.*' to preserve identity; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code manipulates sys.modules to alias packages, which can be risky if module identities are misused, but no malicious intent or suspicious code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific packages ('urllib3', 'idna') and conditionally re-maps their entries in sys.modules to maintain compatibility and package identity. It also handles 'chardet' if present, reassigning its module paths similarly. This is typical for backward compatibility, especially in libraries like requests, to avoid breaking dependencies. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. Its main function is to manipulate module references internally, which could be misused but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely intended for backward compatibility, involving module remapping within sys.modules. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, only internal module aliasing. There is a low risk associated with this pattern, primarily if misused in a different context.",
