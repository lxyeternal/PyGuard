{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions for the Requests library, mainly for string handling and header validation.",
  "sources": "Input is read from the function parameters, such as 'string' and 'u_string'. The 'string' parameter can be any data passed to 'to_native_string'.",
  "sinks": "The functions perform string decoding and encoding, but do not write to external systems or handle untrusted data directly in a harmful manner.",
  "flows": "Input data is checked for type, potentially decoded from bytes to string, or checked for ASCII compliance. There are no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, performs validation, and string conversion without any suspicious or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for header validation, a mapping for these validators based on data type, and two functions: 'to_native_string' which converts bytes to string if necessary, and 'unicode_is_ascii' which checks if a string contains only ASCII characters. No external network activity, credential handling, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The functions perform standard validation and conversion tasks without malicious intent or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for string validation and conversion, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not interact with external systems or perform any unsafe operations.",
