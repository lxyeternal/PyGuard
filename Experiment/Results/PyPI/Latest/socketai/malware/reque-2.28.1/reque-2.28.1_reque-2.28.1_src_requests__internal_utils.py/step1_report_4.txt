  "purpose": "Utility functions for internal use within the Requests library, mainly for header validation and string handling.",
  "sources": "Import of re module, import of 'builtin_str' from a local 'compat' module, and function parameters (string, encoding).",
  "sinks": "The decode method on strings, the encode method on strings, and regex matching operations.",
  "flows": "Input strings are validated and processed through type checks, decoding, encoding, and regex validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Use of regex for header validation is standard. The functions perform basic string manipulations and validations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for string normalization and validation. It uses regex patterns for validating header names and values, ensuring they conform to expected formats. The to_native_string function converts various input types into a native string using decoding if necessary. The unicode_is_ascii function checks for ASCII-only content by attempting to encode the string in ASCII, which is a typical approach. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The code relies on safe string operations and standard regex validation, with no external network calls or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions with no malicious intent. It performs string normalization and validation typical of a networking library. There are no indicators of malware, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The functions are straightforward and do not process untrusted data in a harmful manner.",
