  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code consists solely of utility functions for string handling and header validation.\n- Regex patterns are standard for header validation.\n- String conversions and ASCII checks are common practices.\n- No external data, network activity, or data exfiltration is involved.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code is straightforward and aligns with typical safe practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for header validation and string conversion; benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard utility functions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard header validation and string functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1). Given the benign nature, this seems a bit high. The code doesn't perform any risky operations or external interactions. I suggest lowering this to 0, as the code is clearly safe.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for string validation; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Similar to above, the securityRisk score seems slightly elevated. No suspicious behavior is present. Recommend lowering to 0.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Benign utility functions; no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Malware Score Analysis:**\n- All reports assign malware=0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- No signs of malicious payloads or obfuscated code.\n\n### **Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n\n### **Security Risk Score:**\n- Most reports assign 0, with a couple assigning 0.1 or 0.2.\n- Given the code's simplicity and safety, **any score above 0.1** seems unwarranted.\n- I recommend **setting the securityRisk to 0** for all.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all — consistent.\n- **Security risk score:** Lower to 0 for all reports, as the code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign utility code, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are mostly accurate, but the minor security risk scores should be lowered to 0 for full consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The report's reasoning is sound; the only adjustment needed is in the risk scoring for reports 3 and 4, which should be 0.",
