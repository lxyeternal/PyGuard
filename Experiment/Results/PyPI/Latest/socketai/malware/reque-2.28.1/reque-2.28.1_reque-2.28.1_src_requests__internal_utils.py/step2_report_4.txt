  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code performs standard string validation, conversion, and header validation using regex.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or secret handling are present.\n- The functions are straightforward utility routines.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for internal use, header validation, string conversion.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Input data is internal, no external interactions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No suspicious patterns; functions are standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, consistent, and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard validation.\n- No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Adds that regex patterns are standard, mapping for header validation.\n- Slightly higher confidence (0.9) and securityRisk (0.1), but still no actual risk identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly more cautious, but still aligned with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar detailed analysis, confirms no malicious activity.\n- Confidence slightly lower (0.9), securityRisk=0.2, but no actual issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Reiterates benign utility functions, standard regex, no suspicious patterns.\n- Highest confidence (1.0), securityRisk=0.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only slight variation is in the securityRisk scores, which are very low (0.1 or 0.2) in some reports, reflecting cautious but justified assessments.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is correct; no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, a score of 0 is justified. Slightly higher scores (up to 0.2) can be tolerated if the reviewer wants to be extra cautious, but in this case, 0 is more accurate.\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThe code is standard utility code with no signs of security threats or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scoring should reflect that. I recommend maintaining the malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and setting the security risk score at 0 as well.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0",
