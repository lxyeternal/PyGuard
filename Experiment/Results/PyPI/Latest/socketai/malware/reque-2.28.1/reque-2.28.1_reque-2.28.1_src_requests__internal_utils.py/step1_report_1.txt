  "purpose": "Utility functions for internal use in the Requests library, mainly for header validation and string encoding conversions.",
  "sources": "Input data is the parameter 'string' in 'to_native_string' and 'u_string' in 'unicode_is_ascii'. No external inputs or user inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "The 'decode' method in 'to_native_string' and 'encode' method in 'unicode_is_ascii' are used on input strings, but these are safe string operations without external data transmission or effect.",
  "flows": "Input strings are decoded or encoded within the functions, with no external data flow or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Functions perform straightforward string processing. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for header validation, which are standard and do not pose security issues. The 'to_native_string' function converts various string types to native strings using decoding, which is a common practice; no unsafe code injection or malicious activity detected. The 'unicode_is_ascii' function checks if a string contains only ASCII characters, again a standard utility with no malicious intent. No external data sources, network operations, or hidden behaviors are present. Overall, the code is standard utility code with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions for string handling and header validation. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. No suspicious anomalies were identified.",
