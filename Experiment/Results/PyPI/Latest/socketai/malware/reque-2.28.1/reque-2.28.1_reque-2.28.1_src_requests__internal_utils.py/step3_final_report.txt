  "purpose": "Utility functions for header validation and string conversion within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data from internal function parameters, such as 'string' in 'to_native_string' and 'u_string' in 'unicode_is_ascii'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; functions perform internal data validation and conversion without external communication.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through regex validation or decoding, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard regex patterns and straightforward string operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard regex-based validation for HTTP headers, converts various string types to native strings, and checks for ASCII-only Unicode strings. All operations are typical utility routines with no external data transmission, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. The regex patterns are standard and safe. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The functions are simple, well-structured, and perform common tasks within the requests library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code used for header validation and string handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are consistent with the code's nature. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0, reflecting the safe and standard nature of these functions.",
