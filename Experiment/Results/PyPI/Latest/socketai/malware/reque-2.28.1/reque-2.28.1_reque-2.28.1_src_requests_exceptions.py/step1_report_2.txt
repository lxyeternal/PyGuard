  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling various error conditions in the requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and .compat; class constructors and attribute accesses; potential usage of external response and request objects.",
  "sinks": "Potential assignment to self.response and self.request; exception propagation via super().__init__; pickling (__reduce__) method.",
  "flows": "Initialization of exceptions with args; setting self.response and self.request; pickling process involving __reduce__.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code behavior; standard exception class definitions; proper handling of class inheritance and method overrides.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for exceptions used within the requests library, with constructors that set instance attributes and handle inheritance. The __init__ methods appropriately manage attributes, and __reduce__ is overridden for pickling. No evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious backdoors. The use of external libraries is standard and safe. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception class definitions for the requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles error conditions appropriately without suspicious side-effects.",
