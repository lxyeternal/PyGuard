{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the Requests library to handle various HTTP and connection errors, along with related warnings.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external exceptions (urllib3.exceptions.HTTPError, .compat.JSONDecodeError), and class definitions that do not process external input directly.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data; exception classes are for error handling and do not contain data processing or network operations.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiations are standard; no complex data flow or source-to-sink paths involving untrusted data are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed; all classes are straightforward exception definitions without dynamic code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code purely defines exception classes for error handling in a HTTP request library. It imports external exceptions, extends them with custom classes, and includes minimal logic in constructors. No data input handling, network operations, or security-sensitive processing is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code structure and content are consistent with standard exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for a requests-based library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It solely establishes error handling mechanisms without processing or transmitting untrusted data.",
