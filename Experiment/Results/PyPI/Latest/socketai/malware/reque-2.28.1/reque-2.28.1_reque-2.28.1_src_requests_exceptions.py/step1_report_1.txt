{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for handling various request-related errors in the requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads from input parameters in exception constructors, attributes of response objects, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly write or output untrusted data; it mainly creates exception instances and handles error states.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from sources to sinks; exception objects are instantiated and used internally for error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly defines exception classes with no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of exception class definitions for the requests library. It imports necessary modules, defines classes with standard inheritance, and customizes initializers for specific errors. There are no code injection points, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The code structure is clear, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for handling request errors. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use, with no signs of supply chain sabotage.",
