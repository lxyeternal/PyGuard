{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling various errors and warnings in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and local compatibility module; class definitions and method implementations within the module.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines exception classes without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured hierarchy of exception classes for the Requests library, including custom error types for network issues, decoding errors, and warnings. It imports necessary modules and defines constructors and methods appropriately, with no signs of malicious behavior. The code adheres to standard exception class patterns, uses inheritance properly, and does not include any suspicious code, network activity, or data handling outside standard error definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical exception class module for Requests, with no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and serves its purpose of error handling clearly and securely.",
