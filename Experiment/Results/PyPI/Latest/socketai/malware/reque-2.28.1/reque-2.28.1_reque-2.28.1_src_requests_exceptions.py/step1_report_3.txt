{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors and warnings in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from exception parameters during initialization and from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; exception handling is internal.",
  "flows": "Data flows from exception raising and handling; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code behaviors detected; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes with standard constructors and inheritance, primarily for internal error handling within the Requests library. It imports external exceptions and defines custom ones without any embedded logic that could be malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The exception classes are typical and do not contain code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions for the Requests library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
