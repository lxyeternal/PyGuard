{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata for the 'requests' Python library, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright information.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments at the beginning of the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external data handling; no network or I/O operations",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only assigns static metadata values",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; code consists solely of metadata assignments with no dynamic execution or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code provides static metadata for a Python package and contains no code that reads input, writes output, or executes any logic beyond simple variable assignments. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks, and no data flows. The code appears to be a normal, non-malicious part of a package's metadata declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to define package metadata for the 'requests' library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks present.",
