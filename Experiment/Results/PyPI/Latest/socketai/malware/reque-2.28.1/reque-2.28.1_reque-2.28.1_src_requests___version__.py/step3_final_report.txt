  "purpose": "Static package metadata declarations for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static string variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignments do not process untrusted input or external data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of emojis in __cake__ variable, which is purely decorative and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. No dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or data flows are present. The only unusual aspect is the inclusion of emojis in __cake__, which is harmless and decorative. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, with high confidence, aligning with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The existing reports are accurate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
