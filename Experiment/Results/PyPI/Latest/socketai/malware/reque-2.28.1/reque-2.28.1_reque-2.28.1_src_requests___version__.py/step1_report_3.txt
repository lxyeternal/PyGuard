  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright information.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments, metadata variables set with static values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static metadata assignments are harmless.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of static variable definitions and comments. No obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static strings and integers to metadata variables, which is typical in package setup or metadata files. No dynamic code, external inputs, or suspicious behaviors are present. It includes only comments and metadata attributes, indicating no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard metadata declaration for a Python package with no malicious or security-risk behavior. It appears to be a benign component of the package setup process.",
