  "purpose": "This code initializes and checks dependencies for the 'requests' HTTP library, ensuring compatibility and fallback mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version variables, and functions checking external dependencies and configurations.",
  "sinks": "Warnings and assertions, dependency version checks, import manipulations, and fallback injections.",
  "flows": "Dependency version variables and import checks → assertions and warnings → fallback injection → logging and warnings configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for version checks (which can be disabled), warning injections for dependency issues, and conditional fallback for SNI support. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs dependency compatibility checks, version assertions, and fallback injections for SSL support. It issues warnings if dependencies are incompatible or missing, but these are standard for ensuring environment correctness. No suspicious data flows, malicious code, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The assertions could potentially be disabled, but that is a known risk, not an attack vector. The fallback for SSL support relies on trusted libraries and is not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate initialization code for a widely-used HTTP library without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency and environment setup for the 'requests' library, with checks and fallbacks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or harmful activities are detected. The use of assertions and warnings aligns with common practices for dependency validation, not malicious sabotage.",
