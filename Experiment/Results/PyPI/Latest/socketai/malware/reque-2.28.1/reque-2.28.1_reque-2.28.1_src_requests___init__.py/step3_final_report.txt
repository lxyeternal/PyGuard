{
  "purpose": "The code manages dependency checks, version validation, and SSL fallback mechanisms for the 'requests' library, ensuring compatibility and robustness.",
  "sources": "Import statements for urllib3, chardet, charset_normalizer, cryptography, and environment detection for ssl; version variables; warnings and import checks.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and warnings for dependency versions; fallback injection via pyopenssl; no untrusted data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "Version variables are checked via assertions; fallback modules are injected if SSL lacks SNI support; warnings are issued for dependency issues.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for version validation (which can be disabled); standard fallback mechanisms; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency validation, version assertions, and SSL fallback setup. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. Assertions could be disabled, but this is a known and accepted risk in Python projects. The fallback via pyopenssl is a common compatibility measure. Overall, the code is a typical setup module with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured setup and compatibility module for the 'requests' library, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to assertions. It is safe to use.",
