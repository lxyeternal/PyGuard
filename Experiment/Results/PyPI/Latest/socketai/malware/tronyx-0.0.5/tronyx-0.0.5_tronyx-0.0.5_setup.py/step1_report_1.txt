{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'tronyx' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, package discovery via find_packages(), and hardcoded metadata fields such as name, version, author, email, license, and project URL.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; no external data output or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "The code reads a local README file during setup and passes static metadata into the setup() function without any untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL patterns, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard packaging modules, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with static, predefined parameters. The package dependencies are explicitly listed ('requests'), and metadata like author, email, and project URL are hardcoded. No external input, dynamic code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code follows typical setup patterns and does not contain obfuscated or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for the 'tronyx' package.",
