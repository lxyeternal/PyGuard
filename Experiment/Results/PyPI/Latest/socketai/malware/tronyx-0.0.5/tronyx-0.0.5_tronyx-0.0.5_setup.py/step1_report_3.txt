  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads the README file for the package description, and calls setup() with static metadata, dependencies, and URL. All elements are typical for a Python package setup. No dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, no suspicious behaviors or code injection points.",
