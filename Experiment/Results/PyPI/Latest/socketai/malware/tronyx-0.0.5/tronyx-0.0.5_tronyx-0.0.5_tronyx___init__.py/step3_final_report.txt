{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of 'perm' from the local module 'main', typically used to access functions or variables defined within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is a source, but it does not read external input or data; it references a local module 'main'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet; it does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to the import process, where 'perm' is brought into the namespace; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement, which is common in Python packages. It does not execute any logic, handle untrusted data, or communicate externally. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of malicious indicators. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code's context could influence security considerations, but based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
  "conclusion": "This import statement is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring should reflect zero risk and malware potential.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
