  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports describe a single import statement: `from .main import perm`. This is a standard Python import, bringing in the symbol `perm` from a local module `main`. There is no execution, data processing, or network activity involved. The code is minimal and straightforward.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**  \n- None of the reports identify any obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic execution, network communication, or data handling.\n- The simplicity of the code strongly suggests benign intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, likely due to the minimal possibility that an import could be part of a larger malicious chain, but without further context, this is speculative.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation of the Scores**  \n- Given the isolated import statement, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n- The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report seems overly cautious but not unreasonable, considering that in a broader context, malicious code could hide behind imports. However, with no evidence, it should remain low.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n5. **Potential for Malicious Behavior**  \n- No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The import is standard practice and does not introduce vulnerabilities by itself.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**  \n- Based solely on this snippet, the code is benign.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary unless additional context indicates otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (more appropriate than 0.1, unless further context suggests otherwise)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThe code snippet is a benign import statement with no malicious or risky attributes. The cautious scores in some reports are understandable but should be adjusted downward in the absence of further evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessments; the code is safe and standard. The scores are reasonable, though a risk score of 0 would be more precise than 0.1 given the information.",
