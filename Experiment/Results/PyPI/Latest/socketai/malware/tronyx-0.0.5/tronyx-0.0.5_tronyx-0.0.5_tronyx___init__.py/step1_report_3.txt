  "purpose": "Importing 'perm' from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module file 'main' to access the 'perm' object.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no data is processed or outputted in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only an import statement; no untrusted data handling or execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple relative import; no anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import from a local module, which is a common practice in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or data exfiltration. The snippet is minimal and contains no active code or logic beyond the import statement.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, serving only to import a component named 'perm' from a local module. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks based on this isolated statement.",
