{
  "purpose": "During installation, fetches remote data, saves it as ~/.fleetwood.py, and appends a command to shell config files to execute this script automatically.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen from a remote URL, reading response data",
  "sinks": "Writing to ~/.fleetwood.py, appending commands to ~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile",
  "flows": "Remote URL fetch -> Save to ~/.fleetwood.py -> Append 'python ~/.fleetwood.py' to shell configs",
  "anomalies": "Silent broad exception handling, no validation of fetched content, environment modification without user consent, persistent execution setup during package install",
  "analysis": "The code fetches external data during installation, writes it unvalidated to a local file, and appends commands to user shell configuration files to execute this remote script automatically. Error handling is broad and silent, hiding potential failures. The modifications are persistent and occur without user notification or consent, creating a high risk of malicious activity. The pattern aligns with supply chain attack vectors, enabling remote code execution and system persistence. No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward but malicious in intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, involving remote code fetch, silent environment modification, and execution without validation or user awareness. The behavior is characteristic of supply chain sabotage or malware. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9, security risk 0.9, obfuscated 0) are justified and consistent with the code's actions.",
