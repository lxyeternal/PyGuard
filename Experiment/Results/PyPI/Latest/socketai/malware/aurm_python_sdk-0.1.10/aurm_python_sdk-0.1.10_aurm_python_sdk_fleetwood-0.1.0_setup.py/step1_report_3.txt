{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, including custom installation behavior to fetch and execute external data during installation.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen to fetch data from an external URL; reading and writing to user configuration files (~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile); reading README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "Writing fetched data into ~/.fleetwood.py and appending commands into user shell configuration files.",
  "flows": "Fetching data from the URL -> writing data to ~/.fleetwood.py -> appending command 'python ~/.fleetwood.py' to shell configuration files.",
  "anomalies": "Fetching and executing remote content during package installation; appending commands to user shell config files without validation; no validation or sanitization of fetched content; use of broad exception handling that suppresses errors.",
  "analysis": "The script downloads a resource from an external URL and writes it directly to a local file (~/.fleetwood.py). It then adds a command to execute this script in the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile). These actions happen unconditionally and without validation or user consent. The code does not perform any security checks or sanitization on the downloaded content, which could be malicious. The approach of fetching and executing remote code during package installation is a significant security concern and is commonly associated with supply chain attacks. The rest of the setup code appears standard and benign, but the remote fetch and command injection present high risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains high-risk behavior by downloading and executing remote data during installation and modifying user shell configurations to run potentially malicious scripts. This pattern resembles malicious supply chain activity and should be considered dangerous.",
