  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static string, serving as a benign test or placeholder module.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or environment variables; static code with no data reads.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions; the function returns a constant string.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function simply returns a fixed value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; code is straightforward and clear.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static function with no inputs, outputs, or external dependencies. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. The code structure is simple, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All provided reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
