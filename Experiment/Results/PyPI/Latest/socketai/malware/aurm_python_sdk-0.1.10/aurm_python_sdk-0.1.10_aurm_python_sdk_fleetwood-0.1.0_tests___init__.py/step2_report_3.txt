  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports describe the code as a straightforward `__init__.py` that imports a function from a local module and defines `__all__`. There are no indications of code execution beyond static imports, no untrusted data, no external network activity, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns. Based on the original code, these assessments are accurate; the code is benign and typical for package initialization.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions. They correctly identify that the code performs simple imports with no suspicious behavior. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and clarity.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since the code does not handle untrusted data or perform any risky operations.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nNo report indicates any reason to assign a higher risk score. The code is purely structural, with no dynamic or external interactions. Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \nGiven the code's nature, the malware score should be 0. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid speculative claims; they correctly conclude the code is benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, non-malicious package initialization file with no suspicious patterns, no data leaks, and no external interactions. The reports are accurate, and their scoring reflects this.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are correct in their assessment. No modifications are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final Note:**  \nWhile the reports are accurate, it’s always good to keep in mind that even simple import files could be exploited if the imported modules are malicious or compromised. However, based solely on this code snippet, the security posture is sound.",
