{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing 'test_function' from a local module and defining the export list.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .module1 import test_function",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains no untrusted data handling or external data sinks",
  "flows": "Static import of test_function; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python __init__.py file that imports a function from a local module and defines __all__. It contains no dynamic code, external network activity, or suspicious constructs. The import is static and straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident based solely on this static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for package initialization, and poses no security threat. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
