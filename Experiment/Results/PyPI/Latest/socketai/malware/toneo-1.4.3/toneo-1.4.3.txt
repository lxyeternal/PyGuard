The malware score should be set around 0.3 if 'toneo' is untrusted, with a moderate security risk score (~0.4). The obfuscated score remains 0. Overall, cautious but no definitive malicious activity detected in this fragment."

      "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates seed phrases insecurely using hardcoded credentials, posing a significant security risk. While no malicious code or obfuscation is present, the behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious if misused. The malware score should be increased to reflect the malicious potential of data exfiltration, and the security risk remains high."
