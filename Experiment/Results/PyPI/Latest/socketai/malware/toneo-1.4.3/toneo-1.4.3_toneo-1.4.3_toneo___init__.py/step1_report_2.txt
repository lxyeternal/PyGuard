  "purpose": "Import and execute a function 'a' from the local module 'toneo'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module 'toneo'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the function 'a()' which could potentially perform any action.",
  "flows": "Import from '.toneo' -> calling 'a()' directly.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no obvious anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'a' from a relative module 'toneo' and immediately calls it. Without knowing the contents of 'toneo', it's impossible to determine if 'a' performs malicious actions. The code itself is minimal and does not include any suspicious behavior. However, since 'a()' could perform any operation, there is some inherent uncertainty. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply imports and executes a function from a local module. Without additional context about 'toneo' or 'a()', no malicious behavior can be confirmed. It appears benign based on this snippet alone.",
