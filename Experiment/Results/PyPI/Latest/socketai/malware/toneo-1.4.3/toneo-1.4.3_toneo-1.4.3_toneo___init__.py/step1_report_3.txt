{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'a' from a local module 'toneo' and then calls it.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module, calling function 'a()'.",
  "sinks": "Function 'a()' call, potential execution point that could perform malicious actions if 'a' is malicious.",
  "flows": "Import of 'a' from local module -> execution of 'a()'.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is very simple and lacks context. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function from a local module and executes it immediately. Without the content of 'toneo', it's impossible to determine the behavior of 'a'. The code itself is straightforward and does not contain suspicious or malicious patterns directly. However, depending on what 'a' does within 'toneo', malicious behavior could occur, but this cannot be assessed solely from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet alone, there is no explicit malicious activity or suspicious behavior. The security risk is low, but the overall safety depends on the implementation of 'a' in 'toneo'.",
