{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes a function 'a' from a local module 'toneo'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .toneo and invocation of function a()",
  "sinks": "Execution of function a() which may perform any action defined within 'toneo'",
  "flows": "Import of 'a' from 'toneo' → calling 'a()'",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a single import and call. The import is relative, indicating it is part of a package. The behavior depends entirely on the implementation of 'a' within 'toneo'. There are no evident malicious indicators in this snippet alone. Since the function 'a' is called directly after import, if 'toneo' contains malicious code, it would execute upon module load. No other suspicious activity or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import and function call. Without inspecting the content of 'toneo', it's impossible to determine malicious intent. The code structure itself appears benign.",
