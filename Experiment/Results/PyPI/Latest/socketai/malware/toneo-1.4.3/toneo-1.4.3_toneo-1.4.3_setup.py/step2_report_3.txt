  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n- It defines package metadata: name, version, packages, dependencies (`requests`), description, URL, author info, classifiers, and Python version requirement.\n- It reads `README.md` for the long description.\n- The URL points to a Telegram link (`https://t.me/pozozal`), which is somewhat unusual for a package homepage but not inherently malicious.\n- There are no user inputs, environment variables, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard package setup.\n- Finds no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Completely consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to above.\n- Notes the Telegram URL as unusual but not malicious.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The Telegram URL is flagged as suspicious but not malicious. The report appropriately assigns a low security risk and no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Highlights the Telegram URL as unusual but not malicious.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Same reasoning as Report 2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup.\n- No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup.\n- Notes the Telegram URL as unusual but not malicious.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Similar to others; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the original code provided.\n- **Malware:** All reports agree there is no malware. The malware score is 0 across all.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; scores are 0.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated (0.1-0.2) mainly due to the Telegram URL being unconventional for a package homepage, which could be used maliciously if linked to malicious content. However, in the context of this setup script alone, it does not constitute a security risk.\n- **Suspicious constructs:** None detected.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the script is static and only reads a file.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a standard `setup.py` with no issues.\n- **Malware risk:** 0, as no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal security concern and no malicious activity, a score of **0.0 to 0.1** seems appropriate. The existing reports' scores of 0 or 0.2 are reasonable, but perhaps slightly conservative.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The only notable aspect is the Telegram URL, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- The current scores reflect this understanding adequately.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1            |\n\nThis reflects a very low security concern, consistent with the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action is needed. The code is safe, and the reports are accurate in their assessments.",
