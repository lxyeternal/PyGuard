  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code in question is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project named 'toneo'.\n- It only imports `setuptools` functions and reads static data from files.\n- There are no dynamic inputs, network operations, code execution, or obfuscation.\n- The only potentially suspicious element is the URL pointing to a Telegram link (`https://t.me/pozozal`).\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies that the code is a typical setup script with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; no issues found.\n- **Verdict:** Valid. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, notes the Telegram URL as unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9\n- **Analysis:** The securityRisk score of 0.2 is assigned because the URL is unusual. This is reasonable, as a Telegram link could be used maliciously if it points to malicious content, but in this context, it's just a string.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. No malware, no suspicious code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizes the Telegram URL as unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with previous reasoning.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar, highlights the standard nature of the script, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Analysis:** Correct. No security issues detected.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Similar, notes the Telegram URL as unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9\n- **Analysis:** The lower securityRisk score (0.1) is justified, given the URL's unusual nature but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Evaluation & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Slight variation, but all are low (0.1–0.2), justified by the Telegram URL being unusual but not malicious.\n- **Confidence scores:** High (0.9–1), appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The URL pointing to Telegram is unusual for a package homepage but not inherently malicious. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n- No evidence of code obfuscation, dynamic behavior, or malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the unusual URL, a slightly higher risk score (e.g., 0.1–0.2) is justified, but not higher than 0.2.\n\n**Overall, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (to reflect the unusual URL, but no actual malicious activity)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The only notable aspect is the Telegram URL, which warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores are reasonable, and no significant revisions are necessary.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n| -------- | ------------ | ----- |\n| 0        | 0            | 0.2   |\n\nThis reflects a benign setup script with an unusual but non-malicious URL.",
