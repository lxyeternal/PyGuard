  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package named 'toneo'.\n- It imports only 'setuptools' functions and uses them straightforwardly.\n- It reads 'README.md' for the long description, which is common practice.\n- The URL points to a Telegram link ('https://t.me/pozozal'), which is unusual for package URLs but not inherently malicious.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network operations are present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are identified.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk score is low, mostly around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting the unusual URL but no actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Issues in code:** None of the reports identify any issues with the actual code. The code matches the original and appears benign.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, not obfuscated.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only unusual aspect is the Telegram URL, which could be used for contact or support, not necessarily malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n\n- The **malware score** of 0 in all reports is appropriate.\n- The **security risk scores** are low (0.1–0.2), which is reasonable given the URL's unusual nature but no actual malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** of 0 is correct.\n- The **confidence scores** are high (mostly 0.9–1), reflecting the reviewers' certainty.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The **risk scores** could be slightly increased to 0.2 or 0.3 to reflect the unusual Telegram URL, which might warrant caution, especially if this package is distributed widely or used in sensitive environments.\n- The **malware score** remains at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nBased on the provided reports and analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to the unusual URL, which could be used maliciously if linked to malicious content, but no evidence here)\n\n**Overall, the package appears safe and standard.** The only caveat is the URL, which should be verified externally if necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Confirmed issues:** None.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None identified; reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** Keep malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and increase risk to 0.2 for prudence.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The Telegram URL is unusual and could be used maliciously, but there's no direct evidence in the code itself.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The package is safe, but caution should be exercised regarding the URL if used in sensitive contexts.",
