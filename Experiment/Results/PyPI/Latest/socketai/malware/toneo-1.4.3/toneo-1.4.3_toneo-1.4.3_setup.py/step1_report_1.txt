  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'toneo', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from the script itself and the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct sinks of untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "The only data flow involves reading the README.md file content for the long description; no user input or network data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs observed. The setup script appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools to configure package installation, specifying name, version, packages, dependencies, description, URL, author info, classifiers, and Python version requirement. It reads the README.md for long description content. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures are identified. The setup script follows common packaging practices and contains no malicious or anomalous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
