  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'toneo' that specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Read operation on 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is from reading 'README.md' into the long_description parameter during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The URL 'https://t.me/pozozal' points to a Telegram link, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; it may be used for contact or support.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and reads a README file for description. The code is straightforward with no obfuscated code, suspicious logic, or malicious constructs. The URL provided is a Telegram link, which could be used for malicious purposes if it leads to malicious content, but based solely on this code, it is not evidence of malicious intent. No external or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears to be a typical setup.py file with no security concerns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. The only unusual element is the Telegram URL, which warrants external verification if necessary, but in isolation, it does not constitute malicious behavior.",
