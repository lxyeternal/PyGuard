  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a typical `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n- Reads only `README.md` for the long description.\n- Defines package metadata: name, version, dependencies, URL, author info.\n- The URL points to a Telegram link (`https://t.me/pozozal`).\n- No user input, environment variables, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious or malicious code structures.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** None. All reports agree that the code is standard and straightforward.\n- **Malware presence:** None detected; all reports assign malware score 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; all reports assign obfuscated score 0.\n- **Security risks:** Minimal, mostly related to the URL pointing to Telegram, which is not inherently malicious but could be used for malicious contact or support.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1 & 4 & 5:**\n- Correctly identify the code as standard setup script.\n- Mention the Telegram URL as unusual but not malicious.\n- Assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 or very low.\n- Confidence is high (1 or 0.9), which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n**Report 2 & 3:**\n- Also identify the script as standard.\n- Highlight the Telegram URL as unusual but not malicious.\n- Assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but justified.\n\n---\n\n### Any inconsistencies or unreasonable scores?\n- All reports correctly rate malware as 0.\n- The securityRisk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the Telegram URL's potential for misuse, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 across all, which is accurate.\n\n### Should any scores be adjusted?\n- Since no malicious activity, code obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present, scores are appropriate.\n- The only point of concern is the URL, which is not malicious but unusual; however, the reports already acknowledge this.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- No claims are made based on assumptions; all findings are supported by the code review.\n- No suspicious behaviors or malicious payloads are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to the Telegram URL which could be used for malicious contact but is not inherently malicious)\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (considering the URL's potential misuse but no actual malicious activity)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The setup script is standard, with no security issues. The only minor concern is the Telegram URL, which warrants external verification if needed but does not justify a higher risk score based solely on this code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1.",
