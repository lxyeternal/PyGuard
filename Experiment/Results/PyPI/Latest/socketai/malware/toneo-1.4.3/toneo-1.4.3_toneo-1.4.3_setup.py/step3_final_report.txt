  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'toneo' with no malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Static code reading 'README.md', package metadata, and URL string.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual URL pointing to a Telegram link, which is not typical for package repositories but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with no dynamic or obfuscated code. The only notable point is the Telegram URL, which is unconventional but not malicious. All reports correctly identify the code as benign with malware score 0 and obfuscation score 0. The security risk scores vary slightly (0.1-0.2) due to the URL's unusual nature but are justified. Confidence in benign assessment is high (0.9-1).",
  "conclusion": "The package is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only concern is the Telegram URL, which warrants external verification but does not impact the code's safety. The scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and a very low security risk (~0.2).",
