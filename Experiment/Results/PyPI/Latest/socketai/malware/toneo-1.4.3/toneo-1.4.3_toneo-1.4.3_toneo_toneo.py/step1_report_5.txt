  "purpose": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from user input and sends them via Telegram API to a specified chat for authorization or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "User input from the input() function where seed phrases are entered.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() function that sends data to Telegram API endpoint.",
  "flows": "User inputs seed phrases -> Seed phrases are stored in 'secret_words' -> Constructed message with seed phrases -> Sent via requests.post() to Telegram.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, sensitive seed phrases are directly collected and transmitted without encryption or validation. No input validation beyond count check. No sanitization or encryption for sensitive data. Use of plain requests to send potentially sensitive information.",
  "analysis": "The code prompts the user to input 12 seed words, which are stored in a variable without any obfuscation or encryption. The seed words are directly concatenated into a message and sent over the internet via Telegram API. The bot token and chat ID are hardcoded, exposing potential compromise if the code is shared or stored insecurely. There is no verification or protection for the seed phrases, and the transmission is unencrypted outside of HTTPS, which is standard but still exposes the data if the communication is intercepted. The function does not perform any validation on the seed phrase content, and the purpose appears to be to log or exfiltrate seed phrases, which is malicious if used without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates sensitive seed phrases via Telegram, which indicates malicious intent to leak or capture user secrets. Hardcoded credentials and unencrypted transmission of seed data pose significant security and privacy risks. This behavior suggests the code is designed to collect sensitive data without user awareness or consent, constituting malicious activity.",
