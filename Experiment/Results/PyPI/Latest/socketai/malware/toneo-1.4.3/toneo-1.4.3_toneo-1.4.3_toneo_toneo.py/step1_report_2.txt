  "purpose": "Send user-provided seed phrases via Telegram message for authorization or notification.",
  "sources": "Input from user via input() function, reading 12 seed phrases; the URL request to Telegram API.",
  "sinks": "The POST request to the Telegram API with the seed phrases, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
  "flows": "User inputs seed phrases -> code constructs message -> sends message via Telegram API request.",
  "anomalies": "The code directly transmits sensitive seed phrases over the network without encryption or obfuscation. Hardcoded bot token and chat ID are present, which could be exploited if leaked. No validation or sanitization of input beyond length check. The message contains sensitive info in plain text, which is risky.",
  "analysis": "The script prompts the user to input 12 seed phrases for authorization, then constructs a message with these phrases and sends it via Telegram API using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. The input is not sanitized beyond verifying the count, and the seed phrases are transmitted in plaintext. Hardcoded credentials are present, which is a security risk. The code does not verify the success of message delivery or handle errors meaningfully. Overall, the code exposes sensitive seed phrases over an external channel and contains hardcoded secrets, representing a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects and transmits sensitive seed phrases over the internet via Telegram using hardcoded credentials, which is a major security risk. It appears designed to send secret information without safeguards, indicating malicious intent or severe security negligence.",
