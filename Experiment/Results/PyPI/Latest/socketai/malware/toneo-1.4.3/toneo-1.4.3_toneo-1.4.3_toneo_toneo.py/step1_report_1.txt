  "purpose": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from the user and sends them as a message via Telegram API for authorization purposes.",
  "sources": "User input from the 'input()' function capturing seed phrases.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to Telegram API endpoint with the seed phrases as message content.",
  "flows": "User inputs seed phrases -> The seed phrases are concatenated into a message -> The message is sent via requests.post to Telegram API.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, which could be misused if leaked; no validation or encryption of seed phrases; sensitive information is transmitted unencrypted over network (though HTTPS is used).",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'requests' and 'sys' modules, defines a function that prompts the user to input 12 seed phrases, checks for the correct number, then constructs a message containing these phrases. It sends the message via a Telegram bot API using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. The presence of hardcoded credentials (bot token) and sensitive seed phrases being transmitted in plain text are significant security concerns. There are no indications of malicious code such as backdoors, data theft, or system damage, but the handling of sensitive data indicates poor security practices. The code does not obfuscate or encrypt data, and the seed phrases are directly sent over an API endpoint, making it vulnerable if the token or chat ID are compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect and transmit sensitive seed phrases via Telegram without encryption, with hardcoded credentials that pose security risks. There is no malicious intent evident beyond insecure handling of private information. It should be reviewed for security best practices, such as secure storage and transmission of secrets, and avoiding hardcoded credentials.",
