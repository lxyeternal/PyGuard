  "purpose": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from the user and sends them as a message to a specific Telegram chat via the Telegram Bot API.",
  "sources": "Input from the user via the input() function for seed phrases.",
  "targets": "The requests.post() function sends data over the network to Telegram's API endpoint.",
  "flows": "User inputs seed phrases -> stored in secret_words -> concatenated into message -> sent via POST request to Telegram API.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID in the code, which can lead to unauthorized access if exposed. The code requests sensitive seed phrases and sends them unencrypted to an external service, which is a significant security risk. No validation of seed phrases beyond length check. No error handling beyond sys.exit().",
  "analysis": "The code's main function is to prompt the user for 12 seed phrases and send them to a Telegram chat. The presence of hardcoded credentials (bot token and chat ID) indicates potential malicious intent or security risk, as these could be exploited if the code is shared. The collection of seed phrases and their transmission over the network without encryption or user consent represents a serious security concern. The code does not contain obfuscated code or attempts to hide its behavior. It straightforwardly performs input collection and network transmission, which could be malicious if used maliciously. Overall, the code appears to be designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data.",
  "conclusion": "This script is likely malicious or dangerous, as it collects highly sensitive seed phrases and transmits them to an external Telegram account. The hardcoded credentials and unencrypted data transfer suggest malicious intent and a security threat. Use of this code should be strictly avoided, and if found in an environment, it warrants further investigation.",
