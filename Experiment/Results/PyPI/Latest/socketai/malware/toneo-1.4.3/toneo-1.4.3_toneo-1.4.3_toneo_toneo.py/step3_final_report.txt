  "purpose": "Collects 12 seed phrases from user input and sends them via Telegram using hardcoded credentials.",
  "sources": "User input for seed phrases, hardcoded bot_token and chat_id",
  "sinks": "Telegram API endpoint where seed phrases are transmitted in plaintext",
  "flows": "Input() -> message concatenation -> POST request to Telegram API with seed phrases",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, transmission of sensitive data without encryption or validation",
  "analysis": "The code prompts for seed phrases, verifies count, then sends them unencrypted via Telegram API with hardcoded credentials. No obfuscation or malicious code present, but the behavior involves insecure handling and exfiltration of sensitive data, which could be exploited maliciously. The straightforward structure confirms no obfuscation. The security implications are severe due to exposure of secrets, but the code itself is not malware or obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates seed phrases insecurely using hardcoded credentials, posing a significant security risk. While no malicious code or obfuscation is present, the behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious if misused. The malware score should be increased to reflect the malicious potential of data exfiltration, and the security risk remains high.",
