  "purpose": "Import statements for internal modules and classes to expose package functionality.",
  "sources": "Relative imports from local modules: _version, connection, runners, group, tasks, executor.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements with no runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static import statements without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of '# flake8: noqa' comment to suppress style warnings; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, typical for a package's __init__.py. No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing is present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident. The structure is straightforward and aligns with standard Python package practices. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence is high (1) due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import block with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores and assessments in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the code snippet.",
