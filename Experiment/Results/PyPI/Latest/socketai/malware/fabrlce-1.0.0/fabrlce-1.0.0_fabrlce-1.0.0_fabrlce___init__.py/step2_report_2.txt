  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, such as `_version`, `connection`, `runners`, `group`, `tasks`, and `executor`. These are typical in a Python package's `__init__.py` or module setup, serving to expose classes and functions for external use.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs here.\n   - The `# flake8: noqa` comment is a common way to suppress style warnings and does not indicate malicious intent.\n   - The modules and classes imported appear to be related to configuration, task execution, grouping, and versioning—standard components for a package of this nature.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Errors:**\n   - The reports do not identify any errors or flaws in the code logic.\n   - The code is straightforward and well-structured for its purpose.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the clear, non-obfuscated import statements.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n5. **Potential for False Positives or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a benign import block.\n   - There is no indication of hidden malicious behavior or backdoors.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code content.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- Given the simplicity and standard nature of this code, no further action is needed.\n- If this is part of a larger package, review of other files would be necessary to ensure overall security.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a benign, standard import block with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the code content.",
