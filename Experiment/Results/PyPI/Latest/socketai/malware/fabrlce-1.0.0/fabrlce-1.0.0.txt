      "conclusion": "The code contains insecure handling of secrets and environment variables but shows no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The security risk is moderate, and the code should be refactored to manage secrets securely. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero, with a risk score around 0.5 reflecting the insecure practices."

No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk ~0.2) are appropriate and justified given the controlled, testing nature of the code."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or malicious payloads. The only minor concern is the hardcoded sudo password, which is acceptable within a test environment. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this code is very low risk and free of malicious activity."

The only concern is the exposure of host information via __repr__, which should be sanitized or masked in production environments to prevent sensitive data leaks. No adjustments to the scores are necessary, but documentation or logging practices should consider this privacy aspect."
