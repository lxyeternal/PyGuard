  "conclusion": "The code is safe, primarily serving as a testing utility for SSH connection handling, threading, and data verification. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk ~0.2) are appropriate and justified given the controlled, testing nature of the code."
