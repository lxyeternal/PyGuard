  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'fabrlce', configuring its metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', filesystem checks for directories 'fabric2' and 'fabric', package files ('_version.py', 'README.rst'), and static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Reading environment variables, file I/O operations, dynamic execution of version code, and setting up package installation parameters.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory existence checks influence package naming; reading '_version.py' to determine version; reading 'README.rst' for long description; passing configuration to setuptools.setup() for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of 'exec' to execute version code is standard in setup scripts but can be risky if the file is malicious. However, in this context, '_version.py' is a part of the package source. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily configures package metadata and installation parameters, with some logic to determine package naming based on environment variables and directory presence. The use of 'exec' to execute '_version.py' is a common pattern in setup scripts. All data sources and sinks are standard for a setup script. No code indicates malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It contains standard practices for version reading and package configuration. No security risks are identified.",
