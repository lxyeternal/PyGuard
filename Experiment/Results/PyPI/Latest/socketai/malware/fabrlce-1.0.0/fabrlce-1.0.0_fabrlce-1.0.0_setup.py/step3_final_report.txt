  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script configuring package metadata, environment-based naming, and version loading.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, checks directory existence, reads version info from a local file, reads README for description.",
  "sinks": "Uses exec() to load version info, which executes code from a local file; no network or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks influence package naming; exec() loads version info; no external data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on a local version file, which is common but requires trust in the file's integrity; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script performing package configuration. It reads environment variables and directories to determine package name and entry points, loads version info via exec() from a local file, and sets up package metadata. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The use of exec() is standard in setup scripts for version loading, assuming the '_version.py' file is trusted. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured setup configuration with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The use of exec() on a local version file is standard practice in setup scripts, assuming the file's integrity. The assigned scores are accurate and justified, indicating minimal security risk.",
