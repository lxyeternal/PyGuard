{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and configures a Python package named 'fabrlce' with optional support for a 'fabric2' variant, including package discovery, version reading, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2), filesystem directories (fabric2, fabric), version file (_version.py), README.rst, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools.setup() to perform package installation and configuration, which can execute code (e.g., executing _version.py), but these are standard setup procedures and not malicious.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks influence package naming and entry points; file reads load version and description; setup() configures package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The code includes extensive comments explaining build logic but no suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks for a Python package, including directory checks, environment variable reads, version loading via exec(), and configuration of package metadata. All operations are typical for setup scripts. No code injections, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. External dependencies are specified clearly, and there are no hidden network operations or data leaks. The process relies solely on filesystem checks, environment variables, and reading local files. The code appears intentionally designed for package configuration with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It performs typical package discovery and configuration tasks with clear logic and comments. The risk level is very low.",
