  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The script performs standard setup tasks, including directory checks, environment variable reads, version loading via `exec()`, and package configuration. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity detected.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the lack of malicious behavior. Security risk is low (0.1). Confidence is high (0.9).  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate setup script, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a standard setup process with environment variable influence on package naming, no suspicious code or behavior.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, matching the absence of malicious activity. Security risk is minimal.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard setup script.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, a typical setup script with dynamic naming based on environment variables and directory checks. Uses `exec()` to load version info, which is common but should be trusted. No malicious patterns.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score remains 0; security risk is slightly higher (0.2) but still low.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar observations—standard setup routines, environment variables, file reads, `exec()` for version info. No signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, consistent with benign code.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical setup script.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard setup, environment variable influence, file reads, `exec()` for version info. No suspicious code or behavior.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk low.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate setup code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe the same or very similar code, which is a standard Python package setup script.  \n- **Malware potential:** None of the reports identify any malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code. The use of `exec()` is typical in setup scripts for version loading, assuming the `_version.py` file is trusted.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward with clear comments.  \n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code. Security risks are minimal, primarily due to reliance on local files and environment variables, which are common in setup scripts.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The malware scores across all reports are reasonable and should remain at 0 unless `_version.py` or other files are compromised, which isn't indicated here.  \n- The obfuscated scores are correctly at 0, reflecting the code's clarity.  \n- The overall risk level is very low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to use of `exec()` on local files, which is standard but should be trusted)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should not be changed.",
