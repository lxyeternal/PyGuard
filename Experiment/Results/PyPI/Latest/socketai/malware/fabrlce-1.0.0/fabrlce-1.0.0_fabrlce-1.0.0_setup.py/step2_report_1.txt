  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and determine the accuracy of their assessments, as well as the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python `setup.py`-style configuration script.\n- It performs environment variable checks, directory existence checks, reads version info via `exec()`, and configures package metadata.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or network activity are present.\n- The use of `exec()` to load version info is common but can be risky if the version file is malicious—here, it's from the package itself.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The logic is straightforward and well-commented.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the script as a standard setup configuration with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low)\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The report is reasonable and well-justified.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Also correctly states the script is a typical setup script with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The confidence is high, and no issues are detected.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizes that the script is a standard setup with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score than others, but given the use of `exec()` on a local file, a small increase is justified, especially if the '_version.py' could be compromised. Still, overall, the script appears benign.\n- **Verdict:** The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable; no change necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the script as a typical setup script, noting the use of `exec()` but considering it standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The confidence is high, and no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, describes the script as a standard setup with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The use of `exec()` is standard in setup scripts, and no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low across all reports (0.1–0.2), justified by the standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Personal Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal risk, typical setup script)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package. The risk is minimal, and no malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified.",
