  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension for remote task management, with no malware, obfuscation, or active security risks. The only concern is the exposure of host information via __repr__, which should be sanitized or masked in production environments to prevent sensitive data leaks. No adjustments to the scores are necessary, but documentation or logging practices should consider this privacy aspect."
