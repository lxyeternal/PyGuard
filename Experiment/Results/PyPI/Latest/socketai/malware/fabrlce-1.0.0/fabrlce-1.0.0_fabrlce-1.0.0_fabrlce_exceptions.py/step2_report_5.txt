  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines three custom exception classes: `NothingToDo`, `GroupException`, and `InvalidV1Env`.\n   - These classes are simple, inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - `GroupException` wraps a result object, which is typical for error handling.\n   - The comments suggest potential refactoring or organizational considerations but do not influence security.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No external data processing, network calls, or untrusted input handling.\n   - No obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or anomalies.\n   - The classes are straightforward, serving as error indicators.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concern.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n   - The only minor note is the comment about possibly moving the code to Invoke or making it more focused. This is a code organization concern, not a security issue.\n   - No logic or data processing is present that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is standard, benign, and does not pose any security risk.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical, safe set of exception class definitions with no security implications.",
