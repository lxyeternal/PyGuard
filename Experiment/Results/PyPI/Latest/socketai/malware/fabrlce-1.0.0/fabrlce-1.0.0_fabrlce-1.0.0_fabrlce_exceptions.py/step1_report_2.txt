  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to task execution and environment validation.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and exception definitions do not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exceptions are standard control flow constructs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with straightforward inheritance from Python's built-in Exception class. No external data input, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. The classes are simple wrappers for error handling, and no malicious or malicious-like behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves as custom exception definitions for a larger application or library. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
