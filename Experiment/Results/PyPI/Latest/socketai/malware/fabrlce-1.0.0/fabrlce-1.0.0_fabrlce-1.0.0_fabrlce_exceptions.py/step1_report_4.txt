  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in a Python application, possibly related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings; no external input reading or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this is solely class definitions and exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; standard exception class definitions with comments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains three custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. These are straightforward class declarations inheriting from Exception, with one class (GroupException) storing an additional result object. The comments and structure are standard for exception definitions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be part of a larger codebase, providing exception handling features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign set of custom exception classes used for error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
