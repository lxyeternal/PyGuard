  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a larger application, specifically for grouping errors and environment validation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and comments within the code; no external data inputs or external calls.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; purely class definitions with no data flow.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three custom exception classes with minimal logic. There are no external interactions, data processing, or suspicious patterns. The comments suggest potential refactoring but do not impact security. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
