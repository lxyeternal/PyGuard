{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling and management within a Python project, possibly related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, I/O, or external connections.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The classes are straightforward and conventional for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. They serve as specialized errors for managing flow control or error states within a larger application. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, external data handling, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard and clean implementation of custom exceptions. No obfuscation or obfuscated constructs are present. The comments are benign and describe intended usage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical set of custom exception class definitions used for error management. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. The code is safe and straightforward.",
