  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code defines three custom exception classes: `NothingToDo`, `GroupException`, and `InvalidV1Env`.\n- All classes inherit from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n- The classes are straightforward, with minimal logic, primarily serving as error indicators.\n- The code includes comments suggesting possible refactoring, but these are benign.\n- There are no data inputs, external calls, or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior.\n- No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The exception classes are standard and benign.\n\n### Logical or Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely class definitions for error handling.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the logic or reasoning.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The overall security risk is correctly identified as zero.\n- The purpose of the code is for structured error handling, not for malicious activity.\n\n### Justification for Risk and Malware Scores:\n- Since the code only defines exception classes without external interactions, the scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code appears standard and safe.\n\n### Consistency and Recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, standard, and secure. It functions as part of a larger codebase for error handling, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, benign set of custom exception classes with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no further action is needed.",
