  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error cases in a Python application, likely related to task management or environment configuration.",
  "sources": "No external data input; exception classes are defined without reading untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only defines classes without executing code that processes untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink since the code only declares exception classes without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of class definitions with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exceptions: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. These are used for handling specific error conditions, with GroupException wrapping a result object and InvalidV1Env indicating a missing environment variable or configuration. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The code appears straightforward and typical for exception handling in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data, execute external code, or include any suspicious patterns. Overall, it appears safe.",
