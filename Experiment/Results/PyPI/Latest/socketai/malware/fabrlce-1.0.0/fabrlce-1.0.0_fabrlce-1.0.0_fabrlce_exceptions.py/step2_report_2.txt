  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code only defines three custom exception classes (`NothingToDo`, `GroupException`, and `InvalidV1Env`) with straightforward inheritance from Python's `Exception`. There are no data inputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves as error handling scaffolding.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign and free of malicious behavior, which aligns with the code content. There are no logical flaws or mistakes in their reasoning. They correctly identify that the code is simple class definitions with no external dependencies or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely class definitions with no external data handling, network activity, or code execution, there is no justification for higher risk scores. The scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate. There is no indication of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's explicit content and context, correctly concluding that it is safe.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — no malicious activity or code present.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — code is clear, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code, I agree with the assessments. It’s a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThis code is safe, benign, and appropriate for its purpose as custom exception definitions. No changes to scores are necessary.",
