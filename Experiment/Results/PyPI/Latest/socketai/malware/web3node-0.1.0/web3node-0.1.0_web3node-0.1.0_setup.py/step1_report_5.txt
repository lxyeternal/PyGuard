  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the web3node Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__ string from 'web3node/__init__.py'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "The version string is extracted from a source file, then used in the setup function; no flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to extract version from source file is common, but the pattern is straightforward; no suspicious code execution, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package setup, including reading version info, specifying dependencies, and package data. The version extraction method is simple and standard. All dependencies are typical for a Python project. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The 'install_requires' list includes standard libraries and common tools; no suspicious entries. The code does not include any network activity, credential handling, or obscure code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no apparent malicious intent or security issues. It performs expected tasks for package configuration without any suspicious behavior.",
