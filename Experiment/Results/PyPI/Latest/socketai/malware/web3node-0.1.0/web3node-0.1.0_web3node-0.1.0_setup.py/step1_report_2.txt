  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'web3node' Python package, defining metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'web3node/__init__.py' and defining dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data sinks or output based on untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from package init file; dependencies are specified explicitly without dynamic or external input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, and no obfuscated or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup: it extracts version info via regex, then calls 'setup()' with package metadata, data files, and dependencies. All operations are typical for Python packaging. The version extraction uses a regex search on a file read, which is safe here. The dependencies are statically defined. No dynamic code execution or network activity is observed. The use of 'pyinstaller' as a dependency could be a concern if misused, but in this context, it is merely a build tool listed as a dependency.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The package dependencies and code structure are typical and do not indicate malicious activity.",
