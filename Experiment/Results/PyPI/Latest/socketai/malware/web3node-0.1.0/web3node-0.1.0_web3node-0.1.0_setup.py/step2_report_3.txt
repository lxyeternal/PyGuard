  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code and typical security considerations.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script.\n- The code performs version extraction via regex, which is common.\n- No dynamic or untrusted input processing, network activity, or code obfuscation is observed.\n- Dependencies are typical for Python packaging, with no suspicious packages.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are evident.\n- The code is not malicious in behavior; it merely prepares package metadata and dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming Issues in the Code:\n- The code matches the description: it's a typical setup script.\n- No issues or anomalies are present in the code itself.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The regex for version extraction is straightforward and safe.\n- The use of conditional import for `setuptools` is standard.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly varied (0.1 or 0.2), but all low, which is reasonable.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The only minor point is the inclusion of `pyinstaller` in dependencies, which is a build tool. While not malicious, some might flag it as a tool that could be misused if the package were compromised. However, in this context, it's a standard dependency.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the reports are aligned with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (reflecting minimal concern about build tools like `pyinstaller`, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The assessments provided are accurate and justified.",
