{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'web3node' Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version from 'web3node/__init__.py' using regex. Loads dependencies from 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or data leaks observed. No code execution based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from source file; then passes static metadata and dependencies to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. Uses a standard pattern for version extraction; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'setuptools' or 'distutils'. Extracts version info via regex from a source file, ensuring version consistency. Defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. Dependencies are standard and do not include suspicious packages. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical package setup functions securely.",
