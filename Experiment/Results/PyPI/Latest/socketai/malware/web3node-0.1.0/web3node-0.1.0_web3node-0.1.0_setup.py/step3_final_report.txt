  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'web3node', defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from 'web3node/__init__.py' via regex; static dependencies and package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing; static package configuration.",
  "flows": "Version info read from source file; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with conditional import of setuptools, regex-based version extraction, and package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. Dependencies are standard for packaging. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores are appropriate and justified.",
