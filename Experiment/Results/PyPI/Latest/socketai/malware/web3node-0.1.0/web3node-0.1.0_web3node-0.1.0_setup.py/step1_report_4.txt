{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and installs the 'web3node' Python package, defining its metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string from 'web3node/__init__.py'; imports setup functions; reads package files; specifies dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Version extraction from the package's __init__.py file, then passing metadata and dependencies to setup().",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically reads the version; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; standard setup pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical package setup routine: it imports setup functions, extracts version info via regex, and calls setup() with package details and dependencies. No external input is processed at runtime, and no malicious functions or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The dependencies listed are common for development and packaging purposes, with no indication of malicious intent. The regex for version extraction is standard, though it assumes the __version__ string exists in the __init__.py file, which is common practice. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward setup script with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
