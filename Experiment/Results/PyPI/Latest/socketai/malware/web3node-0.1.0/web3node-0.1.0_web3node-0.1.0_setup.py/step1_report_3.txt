{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'web3node' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'web3node/__init__.py', imports setup functions, and reads package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None present; the script primarily defines package setup parameters and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> passes data to setup() function, installs dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a regex to extract version info dynamically, which is common; no suspicious or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, including version extraction, package configuration, and dependency listing. It conditionally imports setup functions from setuptools or distutils. No external data inputs or outputs are processed at runtime beyond the setup process. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The package dependencies include common libraries and 'pyinstaller', which is a legitimate build tool but not malicious by itself. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs typical package configuration tasks securely and transparently.",
