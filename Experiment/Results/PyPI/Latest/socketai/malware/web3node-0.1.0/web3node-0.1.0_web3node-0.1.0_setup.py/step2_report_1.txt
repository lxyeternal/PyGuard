  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.\n- The version extraction via regex is common practice.\n- Dependencies are typical; none are overtly malicious.\n- No external data, network activity, or untrusted input processing is present.\n- The only minor point is the inclusion of 'pyinstaller' as a dependency, which is a legitimate build tool, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue Presence & Code Review:**\n\n**Does the code contain any malicious or suspicious elements?**  \n**No.** The code is a typical setup script with standard practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n\n**All reports are consistent and accurate.** They correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious logic or behavior. No errors or flaws are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### **Score Analysis & Justification:**\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|----------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0              | 0                | 0.2          | No malware, obfuscation, or security risk; 0.2 reflects minimal concern, perhaps due to dependency 'pyinstaller' which is common. |\n| 2       | 0              | 0                | 0.1          | Same reasoning; very low risk, standard setup script. |\n| 3       | 0              | 0                | 0.1          | Same as above; no malicious signs. |\n| 4       | 0              | 0                | 0.0          | No risk detected, very standard. |\n| 5       | 0              | 0                | 0.2          | Slightly higher, but still negligible; consistent with benign setup scripts. |\n\n**Note:** The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Challenging Assumptions & Additional Considerations:**\n\n- The inclusion of 'pyinstaller' as a dependency is not suspicious; it's a common build tool.\n- The regex-based version extraction is standard; no obfuscation or malicious code.\n- No external or untrusted input is processed at runtime.\n- No code that could be exploited or used maliciously is present.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Final Scores:**\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, primarily due to dependencies, but nothing malicious)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as a standard, benign setup script. The scores assigned are reasonable, with no need for escalation. The code does not pose any security threat or contain malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores. No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to prepare a summarized report or any additional analysis?**",
