{
  "purpose": "Define version information and publicly available attributes for the module",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from variable assignments and the sys module (import sys)",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or external communication occurs",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and typical for a module's metadata",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version tuple and string, and defines an __all__ list for exports. It imports the sys module but does not use it, which is harmless but slightly unnecessary. There are no functions, user input, or dynamic behaviors; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve as module metadata with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks identified. It is straightforward and typical for a Python package's versioning and export list.",
