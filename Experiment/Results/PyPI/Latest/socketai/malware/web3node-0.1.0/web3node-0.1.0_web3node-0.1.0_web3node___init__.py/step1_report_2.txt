  "purpose": "Define package version information and export specific symbols",
  "sources": "Reading the sys module, accessing version info variables",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data output or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only initializes variables and exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module solely for potential future use but does not utilize it. It defines a version tuple and a version string, which are standard for package metadata. The __all__ list specifies symbols to be exported. There are no dynamic executions, obfuscation, or suspicious operations. Overall, the code appears to be standard package initialization code with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, non-malicious package metadata setup with no suspicious or malicious elements detected.",
