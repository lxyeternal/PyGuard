  "purpose": "Define version information and export a list of modules or features for external use.",
  "sources": "Read from the import sys statement and variable assignments (__version__, __all__).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Input source (import sys) does not flow into any sinks; variable assignments are static and do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. The code appears straightforward and standard for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module but does not use it further, indicating possible placeholder or minimal setup. It sets a version tuple and string, and defines __all__ for module exports. No dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no malicious patterns are present. The code is typical for a Python package's version and module exports setup.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign code snippet used for package metadata, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
