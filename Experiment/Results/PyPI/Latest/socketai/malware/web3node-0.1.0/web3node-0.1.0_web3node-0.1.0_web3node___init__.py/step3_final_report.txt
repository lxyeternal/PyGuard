  "purpose": "Define package version information and export symbols for a Python module.",
  "sources": "Reads hardcoded version info and a list of module names; imports sys (unused).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of sys; no other anomalies or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module metadata snippet setting version info and export list. It imports sys but does not use it, which is harmless. No dynamic code, user input, external data, or network activity is present. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior are detected. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The unused import of sys is minor and does not impact security. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
