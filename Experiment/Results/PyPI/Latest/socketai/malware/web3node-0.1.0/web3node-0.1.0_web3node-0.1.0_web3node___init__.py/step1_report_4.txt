  "purpose": "Defines package version information and exports specific module names",
  "sources": "Reads no external input or data",

  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, minimal code structure",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a version tuple and string, sets an __all__ list for module exports, and imports sys without using it. There are no functions, no external data handling, and no suspicious logic or malicious behavior. It appears to be a standard module initialization with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module metadata definition with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
