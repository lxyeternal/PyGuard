  "conclusion": "The code employs covert data exfiltration techniques via DNS queries, which are suspicious and potentially malicious in untrusted environments. While it lacks explicit malicious payloads, its behavior aligns with malware-like exfiltration channels. Therefore, a malware score of approximately 0.65 and a security risk score of about 0.7 are appropriate. The code is not obfuscated. Overall, it warrants caution and further review if found in a package, but it does not contain overt malicious payloads."
