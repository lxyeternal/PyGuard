{
  "purpose": "Download and execute a file named 'pytorch' from a remote server, then run it in the background.",
  "sources": "os.system call executing a shell command to download and run an external file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file './pytorch' after changing its permissions.",
  "flows": "The code runs a shell command that downloads a file from an external IP, makes it executable, and runs it in the background.",
  "anomalies": "The command downloads an executable from a hardcoded IP address and executes it without verification, which is suspicious. The URL does not specify a filename, and the process is executed with 'nohup' without any input or output handling. There are no checksums or validation for the downloaded file.",
  "analysis": "The code uses os.system to run a bash command that fetches a remote file via 'wget' from IP 122.51.221.63, saves it as 'pytorch', makes it executable, and runs it in the background. This behavior indicates potential malicious activity, such as downloading and executing arbitrary code, possibly for malicious purposes. The use of 'nohup' and background execution suggests an attempt to hide or persist malicious activity. No validation or sanitization is performed on the downloaded content, increasing the risk. Overall, this pattern is typical of malicious payload delivery in supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior indicative of malicious activity, involving remote code download and execution without safeguards. It should be treated as malicious, and the package containing this code is not safe to use.",
