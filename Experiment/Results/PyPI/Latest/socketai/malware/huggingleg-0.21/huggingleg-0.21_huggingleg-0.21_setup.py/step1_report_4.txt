  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'huggingleg'.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'X', the external URL '122.51.221.63/pytorch', and the os.system call.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing remote download and execution of a potentially malicious script.",
  "flows": "Checks environment variable 'X' -> If not 'True', executes remote download and execution -> proceeds with setup.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional download and execution of a file from an external IP address upon any environment where 'X' is not set to 'True'. The remote URL is an IP address, which is suspicious, and the downloaded file is executed directly, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'distutils.core.setup' and 'os'. It then checks the environment variable 'X'. If 'X' is not equal to 'True', it runs 'os.system' to download a file from a specific IP address, change its permissions to executable, and run it in the background. This behavior is highly suspicious because it downloads and executes code from an untrusted source without validation, which is a common tactic for malware. The setup configuration itself appears normal, but the preceding code's malicious activity dominates the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing code from an external IP address without user consent, which is a significant security risk. This indicates an intentional supply chain attack or backdoor mechanism embedded in the package setup process.",
