{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be setting up a Python package named 'huggingleg' and executing a command to download and run a remote executable if a specific environment variable is not set.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'X' and the os.system call executing a wget command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a remote script which could potentially lead to code execution, malware installation, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "If 'X' is not set to 'True', the script downloads an executable from a remote IP and runs it, which can lead to executing arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of environment variable check combined with immediate remote code execution via wget and nohup. The remote IP is hardcoded and suspicious. The code downloads and executes an external file without validation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports distutils.core.setup for package setup, which is standard. It then checks the environment variable 'X'; if not set to 'True', it runs a system command to download and execute a remote executable from a specific IP address. This behavior is suspicious, as it attempts to run code from an external, untrusted source. The setup configuration itself appears normal, but the remote execution is a significant security risk and typical of malicious activity. The code does not sanitize or verify the downloaded content. Overall, the main concern is the remote download and execution triggered conditionally, which could compromise the host system.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote binary without validation, which is a common tactic for malware delivery. The setup part is standard, but the remote code execution constitutes a significant security threat.",
