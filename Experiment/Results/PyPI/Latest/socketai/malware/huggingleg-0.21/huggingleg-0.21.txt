      "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code without validation, representing a high-severity supply chain attack vector. The behavior is straightforward and malicious, with no obfuscation. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The code should be treated as malicious, and the package should not be trusted."

The behavior aligns with known malware patterns, warranting a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1. The code is not obfuscated, and the risk is extremely high, making it unsafe for use."
