  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, network calls, subprocesses.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file I/O, subprocess execution, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing functions, network requests, or subprocess calls.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either no code or benign code with no suspicious patterns. Confidence scores are generally high where code exists, but given the lack of concrete code snippets, slightly reducing confidence would better reflect uncertainty. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the benign assessments. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), indicating minimal concern. No anomalies or obfuscation detected. The evaluations are coherent and cautious, appropriately reflecting the limited evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on current analysis. Scores are consistent with the evidence, though confidence levels could be slightly tempered where code is absent. Overall, the package appears safe.",
