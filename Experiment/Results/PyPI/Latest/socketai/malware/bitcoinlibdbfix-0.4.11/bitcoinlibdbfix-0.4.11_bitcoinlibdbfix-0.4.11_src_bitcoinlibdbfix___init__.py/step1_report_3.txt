  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects, such as network transmission, file writing, or system commands.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present due to the absence of code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors are observable without code content. The code appears absent or empty.",
  "analysis": "The review reveals that no code is provided for analysis. Therefore, no security issues, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns can be identified. Without actual code, assessment of sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, or potential risks is impossible.",
  "conclusion": "There is no code present to analyze, so no malicious behavior or security risks can be identified. The overall assessment is that the package or script is currently empty or missing, thus no evident malicious intent or security concerns.",
