  "purpose": "This code appears to perform data processing and possibly interacts with external systems, but without further context, its specific purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data is read from user inputs, environment variables, or external modules such as network requests or file I/O.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous sinks include network communication functions, subprocess calls, or writing sensitive data to logs or files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like user input or environment variables to sinks such as network transmission, file output, or subprocess execution.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; however, unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns are absent, but some dynamic imports or eval usage would warrant closer inspection if present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with clear data input points and output sinks. No signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoors are evident. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No obfuscation, suspicious function names, or hardcoded secrets are observed. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious patterns or security risks based on the visible structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign data processing script with typical input/output operations. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
