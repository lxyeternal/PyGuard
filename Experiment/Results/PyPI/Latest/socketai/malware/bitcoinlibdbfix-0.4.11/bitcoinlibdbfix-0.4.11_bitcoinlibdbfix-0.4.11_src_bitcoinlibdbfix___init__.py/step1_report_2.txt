  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some standard data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or comments, the exact goal is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user inputs, or external files. Specific input sources are not explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Data may be sent to output functions, network calls, or stored in files. No explicit sinks are identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment, files, user input) to processing functions, then potentially to outputs or external calls. Exact paths are unclear due to lack of explicit data flow statements.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are detected in the provided snippet. The code uses standard libraries and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code includes standard Python syntax, with no obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic code execution observed. It appears to perform expected operations without malicious indicators. Since no malicious activities or suspicious behaviors are explicitly present, the code seems benign. However, due to the lack of specific context or external references, some uncertainty remains.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard utility or processing code with no evident security concerns.",
