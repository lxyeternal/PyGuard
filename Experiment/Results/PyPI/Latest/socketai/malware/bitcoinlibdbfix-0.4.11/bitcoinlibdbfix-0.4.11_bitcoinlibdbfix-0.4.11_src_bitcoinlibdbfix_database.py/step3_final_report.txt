{
  "purpose": "The code collects system IP geolocation info, reads files from specified directories, encodes or attaches them, and transmits data/messages/files to external services (Telegram, Discord, custom API).",
  "sources": "Requests to external APIs (IP info), reading files from disk, hardcoded tokens/URLs/keys, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to messaging platforms and custom API, file reads for transmission, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (IP API, files, embedded secrets) flow into data encoding or message payloads, which are then sent via HTTP POST to external endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded secrets (tokens, URLs, hash), no validation or encryption of transmitted data, straightforward code with no obfuscation, no active malicious commands or payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for data collection and exfiltration, utilizing embedded secrets and multiple channels. It reads files, encodes them, and sends system info and files without validation or user consent. No active malware payloads (system damage, remote code execution) are present. The embedded secrets pose security risks, and the behavior aligns with covert data theft. The code is not obfuscated, and its structure is straightforward. The malware potential is high if misused, but the code itself does not contain active malicious commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a suspicious data exfiltration tool with embedded secrets and multi-platform transmission capabilities. It does not contain active malware payloads but poses significant security risks if exploited. The malware score should be around 0.5, reflecting high suspicion but no active malicious payloads. The security risk score is high (~0.75) due to embedded secrets and potential misuse.",
