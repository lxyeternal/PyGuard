  "anomalies": "Execution of code during import, which is unconventional but common in setup scripts; no obfuscation or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports core modules and defines __all__. It attempts to import and run run_pre_install() from the installer module, suppressing ImportError. No malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The pattern of executing code during import is typical in setup routines but can be exploited if the installer module is compromised. The security concern hinges on the trustworthiness of the external installer module. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The risk score is low (around 0.1-0.3), reflecting the potential danger of executing arbitrary code during import, but no evidence suggests malicious intent. The code itself is straightforward and standard for package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup pattern with a pre-install hook executed during import. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected. The primary security consideration is trusting the external installer module. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low risk score (~0.1-0.3). Overall, the code appears safe, but caution should be exercised regarding the trustworthiness of external modules.",
