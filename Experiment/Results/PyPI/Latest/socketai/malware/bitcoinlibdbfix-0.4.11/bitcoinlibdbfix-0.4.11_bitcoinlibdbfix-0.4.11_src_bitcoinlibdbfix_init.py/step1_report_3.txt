  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package, importing main components and version info, and attempts to run a pre-install check during import.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (.cli, .version, .installer), and the call to run_pre_install()",
  "sinks": "The run_pre_install() function, which may execute code during import",
  "flows": "Import statements -> run_pre_install() (if available)",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import and execution of run_pre_install() during import could be exploited if run_pre_install() contains malicious code, but the code itself appears standard and typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports main functionality and version info, then attempts to run a pre-install check via run_pre_install(). This pattern is common in setup or install scripts. The try-except block suppresses ImportError, preventing crashes if run_pre_install is absent. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present in this fragment. The potential risk hinges on the contents of run_pre_install(), which isn't provided, but the pattern itself is standard for installation checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical initialization script for a Python package, designed to run pre-install checks if available. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
