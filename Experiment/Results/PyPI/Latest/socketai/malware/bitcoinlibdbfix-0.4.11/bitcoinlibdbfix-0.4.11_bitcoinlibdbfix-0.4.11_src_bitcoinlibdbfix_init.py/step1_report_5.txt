{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package by importing core components, setting exports, and executing pre-install checks if available.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'main', '__version__', and 'run_pre_install'; execution of run_pre_install during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing or data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "The only flow is the optional execution of run_pre_install during module import, which could potentially perform setup actions.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import and execution of run_pre_install suggest setup or installation logic. No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard package initialization tasks. It attempts to run a pre-installation check via run_pre_install if available, which is a common pattern in Python packaging. The try-except block prevents errors if the installer module is absent, indicating safe fallback behavior. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical package setup patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package initialization code with a conditional pre-install step. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected. The implementation appears safe and intentional.",
