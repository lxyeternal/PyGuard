  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `main` from `.cli` and `__version__` from `.version`.\n- Defines `__all__` with these two.\n- Attempts to import `run_pre_install` from `.installer` and execute it during import, silently ignoring `ImportError`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code executes `run_pre_install()` during import if available, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present in this fragment.\n- The main concern is trusting the `installer` module and its `run_pre_install()` function, which are external to this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Standard package initialization, execution of pre-install checks, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct; no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.3 (low to moderate, due to execution during import)\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, notes that executing code during import could be malicious if `run_pre_install()` is compromised.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct; no malware detected in code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.3 (same reasoning)\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. No evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern, emphasizes the standard nature of the code, and the potential risk hinges on `run_pre_install()`'s content.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (lower, considering it's typical for setup scripts)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Verdict:** Valid; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar, notes that automatic execution could be misused if `installer` module is malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (slightly higher, considering the automatic execution)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Fully agrees with the code being standard, with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. The code does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varies between 0.1 and 0.3, which seems reasonable given the automatic execution during import.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The main security concern is trustworthiness of the `installer` module and its `run_pre_install()` function, which are external.\n- The pattern of executing code during import is common in setup scripts but can be exploited if the code is malicious.\n- Since no malicious indicators are present in this snippet, the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, based on execution during import, but typical for setup routines)\n\nThis reflects a cautious but standard view: the code itself is safe, but the trustworthiness of the external `installer` module remains a concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is standard for package initialization, with execution of pre-install checks during import, which is typical but warrants trust in external modules. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present.",
