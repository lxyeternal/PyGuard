  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the logic, and the scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes standard wallet management operations; no suspicious data flow or anomalies.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior. Sensitive info is printed, which is a security concern but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states no signs of malicious activity; high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct, no malware)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 (reasonable, mainly due to printing sensitive info)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar standard operations; notes sensitive data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Highlights that passphrases and private keys are printed, which is insecure but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity detected; confidence 0.8.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0.3 (slightly higher due to exposure of secrets) but still not indicating malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard wallet functions; no suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Same concerns about printing secrets; no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious activity; confidence 0.9.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 (reasonable)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard operations; potential issues with passphrase handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Notes insecure handling of secrets (printing passphrases), but no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity; confidence 0.9.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.3 (due to insecure secret handling)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar standard wallet management; no suspicious network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Again, sensitive data is printed, but no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent; confidence 0.8.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Synthesis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code uses standard libraries and functions without signs of sabotage or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report.\n- **Risk Score:** While the code handles sensitive data insecurely (printing secrets), this is a security practice issue, not malware or sabotage.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no evidence of malicious behavior across all reports)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** **0.2–0.3** (due to insecure handling of secrets, mainly printing passphrases and keys)\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\nThe code appears to be a standard Bitcoin wallet management utility. The main concern is the insecure handling of secrets (printing passphrases, WIF keys), which is a security risk but not malware or sabotage. There are no signs of supply chain attacks, backdoors, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware        | **0**                |\n| Obfuscated     | **0**                |\n| Security Risk  | **0.2–0.3**          |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence provided and the logical analysis of the code's behavior.",
