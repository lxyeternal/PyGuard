  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages Bitcoin wallets, no malicious behavior, handles passphrases and keys responsibly, no obfuscation, malware score 0, low security risk.\n- **Logic Check:** The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious operations. It uses standard libraries, and no backdoors or exfiltration mechanisms are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes that sensitive data is printed (passphrases, private keys), which is a security concern but not malicious.\n- **Logic Check:** The code prints passphrases and private keys, which is insecure but not malicious. No network activity or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3 — acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard wallet functions, no malicious behavior, potential security risk due to printing sensitive data.\n- **Logic Check:** Same as above; no malicious intent, just insecure handling of secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, emphasizes insecure secret handling but no malicious activity.\n- **Logic Check:** No signs of malware or sabotage, just poor secret management practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no malicious activity, just insecure printing of secrets.\n- **Logic Check:** No malware, no obfuscation, standard wallet functions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports assign malware score 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—no malicious operations, network exfiltration, or sabotage detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree the code is not obfuscated.\n- **Security Risk:** The main concern is the insecure handling of secrets (printing passphrases, private keys). While this is a security vulnerability, it is not malware or sabotage.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** I concur with 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the security concern about secret exposure, a score of 0.2–0.3 is justified. Since the reports have assigned 0.2–0.3, I agree.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious intent or code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.25 (due to insecure secret handling, but no active exploitation or malicious behavior)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard wallet management script with no malware or sabotage detected. The primary concern is insecure handling of secrets, which is a security best practice issue rather than malicious code.\n\n**Final verdict:** The reports are consistent with the code, and I agree with their scoring and conclusions.",
