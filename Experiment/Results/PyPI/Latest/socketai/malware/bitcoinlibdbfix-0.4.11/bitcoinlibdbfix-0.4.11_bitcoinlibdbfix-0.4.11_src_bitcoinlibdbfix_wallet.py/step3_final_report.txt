{
  "purpose": "The code manages Bitcoin wallets, including creation, listing, key generation, transaction import, and sending transactions, using bitcoinlib.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, command-line arguments, and files (for transaction import).",
  "sinks": "Print statements output sensitive data such as passphrases, private keys, transaction hashes, and status messages.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., passphrases, transaction data) flows from parameters/files to wallet functions; sensitive data is printed directly, and transactions are sent via wallet methods.",
  "anomalies": "Insecure handling of secrets: printing passphrases, WIF keys, and transaction hashes to stdout; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard wallet operations with external libraries. It does not contain malicious network activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The main security concern is the insecure exposure of secrets through print statements, which is a security practice issue but not malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The functions follow typical patterns, and no suspicious data flows or anomalies are detected beyond insecure secret handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Bitcoin wallet management utility with no signs of malware or sabotage. The primary issue is insecure secret exposure via print statements, which constitutes a security risk but not malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.3 due to secret handling practices.",
