  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the report details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code performs standard Bitcoin wallet management functions using bitcoinlib.\n- Sensitive data such as passphrases, WIF keys, and transaction hashes are printed to stdout.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n- No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The code relies on external, well-known libraries for core functions.\n- The main security concern is the insecure handling of secrets (printing passphrases and private keys), but this is a poor security practice, not malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard wallet management.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected. The report correctly states the code appears legitimate with no signs of malware.\n- **Score justification:** The low malware and risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.3\n- **Analysis:** The report emphasizes the exposure of secrets via print statements but finds no malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** The risk score of 0.3 reflects the security concern of secret exposure, but not a malicious threat. Malware remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same core functions.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** Similar to previous, no malicious activity. The main concern is secret exposure.\n- **Score justification:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same functions.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.3\n- **Analysis:** Same conclusions; no malicious behavior, just insecure secret handling.\n- **Score justification:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** Same as others; no malware, just poor secret handling.\n- **Score justification:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is standard wallet management code, with no backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.2–0.3) mainly due to secret exposure via print statements. These are security concerns but not malware.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (No signs of malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (Code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** **0.2–0.3** (Insecure secret handling, but no active malicious risk)\n\n**Final justification:**  \nThe code is a typical wallet management utility. The only notable issue is the insecure handling of sensitive data, which is a security best practice concern but not malware. The absence of network exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation confirms the low malware risk.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent with my assessment. The malware scores are accurate at 0, and the risk scores appropriately reflect the insecure secret handling. The overall security posture is low risk, with the main concern being poor secret management practices rather than malicious intent.",
