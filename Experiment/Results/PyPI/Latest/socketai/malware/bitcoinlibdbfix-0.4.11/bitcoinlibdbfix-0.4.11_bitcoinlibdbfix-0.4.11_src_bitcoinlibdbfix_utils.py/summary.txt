  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, with reports 3 and 4 showing behaviors that justify moderate suspicion due to dynamic code execution. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are consistent with the described patterns. The primary concern remains the use of 'exec' and 'eval' with untrusted data, which justifies the elevated scores in reports 3 and 4. No further adjustments are necessary based on the provided summaries."
