  "purpose": "Assigns operator privileges to a specified user via command line input.",
  "sources": "The 'username' argument provided through command line input.",

  "flows": "Input 'username' from command line -> assign_operator function -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present. No external network or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The script parses a username argument from the command line and outputs a message indicating privilege assignment. The logic is straightforward and does not perform any system modifications, network activity, or data handling beyond printing to the console. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code appears to be a simple utility for administrative purposes, with no security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply outputs a message based on command line input, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
