  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic execution typical of malicious payloads. While the actual payload content is unknown, the pattern strongly suggests malicious behavior. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. It should be treated as a serious security concern pending further payload analysis."
