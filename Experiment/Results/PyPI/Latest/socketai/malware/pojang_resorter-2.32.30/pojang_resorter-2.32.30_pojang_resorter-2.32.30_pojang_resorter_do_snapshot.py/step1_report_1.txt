  "purpose": "Obfuscated code that decodes and executes a base64-encoded payload after decompression.",
  "sources": "Input data is the hardcoded base64-encoded string, and the data is processed via string slicing and decoding.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decompressed and decoded code via exec() which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Input data is reversed, base64-decoded, decompressed, then executed. Data flow: hardcoded string -> reversed -> base64 decode -> decompress -> exec.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda for decoding, reversing string, base64 decoding, decompressing, and immediate exec() on the result; all are indicators of obfuscation and potential malicious payload.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an anonymous lambda function that performs zlib decompression on data decoded from base64, after reversing the string. The payload is a large base64-encoded string assigned directly within the exec() call. The entire process is obfuscated, likely to hide malicious intent. The final step executes the decompressed code, which could be arbitrary and malicious. This pattern—reversal, base64 decoding, decompression, and dynamic execution—is commonly used to hide malicious scripts or payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its obfuscation, use of exec(), and decoding of a large, encoded payload. It is likely malicious, designed to conceal malicious activities. Without further analysis of the decompressed payload, the safest assumption is that it could perform malicious actions.",
