  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the findings, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- The script acts as a command-line utility dispatching commands to run other scripts or invoke functions from external modules.\n- It uses explicit command choices, reducing arbitrary execution.\n- It executes scripts via subprocess without sanitizing user input beyond command choice.\n- It imports and calls functions directly from modules, which could be risky if those modules are malicious.\n- No obfuscated code or malware signatures are present.\n- The main concern is reliance on external scripts/modules, which could be compromised.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Explains the script as a dispatcher for server management.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that subprocess calls and dynamic imports are present, with some risk if external scripts are malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, but external scripts could be exploited.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the code.\n- **Security risk:** 0.4 — reasonable, given external script execution.\n- **Confidence:** 0.75\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues with the logic.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar overview, emphasizing safe libraries.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that subprocess calls are based on fixed script names, and imports are straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious code detected; external scripts are the main concern.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned, consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same general description.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes that subprocess execution is controlled via command mapping, and imports are from fixed modules.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or malware evident.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, focusing on server management.\n- **Analysis:** Notes that the command mapping is controlled, and external modules are imported explicitly.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same general overview.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes that the script is a dispatcher with controlled command mappings and external script execution.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected; main concern is external modules.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious code or malware:** None detected across all reports. The code itself is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs.\n- **External scripts/modules:** The main potential security concern. If those external scripts or modules are malicious or compromised, they could execute malicious code.\n- **Input validation:** Limited to command choice; no sanitization of `extra_args`. However, since arguments are passed directly to scripts or functions, the risk is mainly external script integrity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n  - **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.4; reasonable given external script execution.\n\n---\n\n### **My final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code or signatures.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — low, assuming external scripts are trusted; higher if external scripts are compromised.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional notes:**\n\n- The code could be improved by adding input sanitization or validation of `extra_args` before passing to subprocess.\n- Ensuring external scripts/modules are securely maintained and verified is critical.\n- The current scores reflect a low-risk, non-malicious utility with external dependencies as the main concern.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Score |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| Malware        | 0            |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2          |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
