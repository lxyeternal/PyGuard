{
  "purpose": "This script acts as a command-line interface to execute predefined scripts or functions related to server management and Mojang interaction, based on user input.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments ('command' and 'extra_args'), and dynamically imports modules or runs scripts based on the command.",
  "sinks": "Executes subprocesses to run other Python scripts; imports functions and calls them directly; writes logs to a file.",
  "flows": "User input via command-line -> command parsing -> command mapping -> dynamic script execution or function call.",
  "anomalies": "Potentially executing arbitrary scripts based on command input; no explicit validation or sanitization of command parameters; dynamic import of functions from external modules could be risky if those modules are compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts commands and additional arguments from the user. It maps commands to specific script files or functions, and executes them via subprocess or direct function calls. The subprocess execution uses fixed script names, reducing risk of arbitrary command execution, but relies on existing script files. The direct import of functions from 'pojang_resorter' modules could be exploited if those modules are maliciously altered, but within this code, the import is straightforward and appears controlled. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. There are no indications of obfuscation or malicious code such as data exfiltration, system damage, or network communication beyond standard script execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard command dispatcher for server management tasks. No malicious behavior or malware is evident. The main risk is potential reliance on external modules that could be compromised, but within this code snippet, no malicious activity is observed.",
