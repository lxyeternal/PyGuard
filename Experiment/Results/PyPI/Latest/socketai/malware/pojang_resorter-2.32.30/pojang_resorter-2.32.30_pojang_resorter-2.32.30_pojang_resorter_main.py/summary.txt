  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, explicit command dispatcher with no inherent malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security risk stems from external scripts and modules that are invoked, which could be malicious if compromised. The overall malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting reliance on external dependencies. No evidence of sabotage or malicious payloads is present within the code itself."
