  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal Python module that:\n- Defines package metadata (__version__, __author__)\n- Imports a main function from a local module (.main)\n\n**Assessment of the Code:**\n- No data processing, user input, network activity, or external data handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The import statement is standard for package structure.\n- The code is straightforward and declarative.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**Common findings across all reports:**\n- They uniformly describe the code as simple, metadata + import, with no suspicious behavior.\n- No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- No data flows or external interactions.\n- High confidence levels (mostly 1, some 0.9) in their benign assessment.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, and security risks are 0.\n\n**Logical consistency:**\n- All reports agree that this is a benign, standard package initialization fragment.\n- No contradictions or assumptions that could be challenged.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Scores:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports. This aligns with the analysis, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, justified given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**\nYes. The code is trivial and does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The reports do not identify any actual issues or vulnerabilities.\n- They do not claim or imply any malicious behavior.\n- The code's simplicity supports the conclusion of low risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code and analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Personal Assessment:\nBased on all the information, I would assign the following scores:\n\n| Metric             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | 0      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      |\n| Security Risk      | 0      |\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a standard package metadata and import module.\n- No malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- No security vulnerabilities or data flows.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
