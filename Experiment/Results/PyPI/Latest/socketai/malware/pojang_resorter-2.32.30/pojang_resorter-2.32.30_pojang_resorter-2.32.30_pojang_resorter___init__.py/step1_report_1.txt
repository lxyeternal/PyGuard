  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module to load the main function.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data processing, input/output operations, or untrusted data handling shown.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and sets metadata, with no data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no suspicious patterns; no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports a main function from a local module. It contains no data processing, user input, or network activity. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present. The import statement appears standard for a package setup. The simplicity of the code and absence of external data sources indicate low risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module that provides package metadata and imports a main function. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malicious data flows, or security issues in this fragment.",
