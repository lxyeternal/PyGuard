  "purpose": "Provides metadata and entry point import for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module, package version, author metadata",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or input/output handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports and metadata assignments",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior; standard module metadata and import",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports a main function from a local module. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external network interactions. The import is from a local module, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple package initialization file with standard metadata and an import statement. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
