  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways are identifiable in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only package metadata and a single import statement; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports the main function from a local module. No input handling, data processing, or external communication is present. The import appears standard for Python packages, and no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package metadata and import declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign setup code fragment.",
