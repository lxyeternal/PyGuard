{
  "purpose": "Provide a CLI help interface with ASCII art and command descriptions for a Python-Mojang interaction tool.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments parsed by argparse.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only displays information and does not process or output untrusted data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input (CLI args) -> argparse parsing -> conditional help display (ASCII art and command list).",
  "anomalies": "Use of ASCII art with no apparent functional purpose; no user input validation beyond command parsing. No sensitive data handling. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored terminal output and defines a function to display a stylized ASCII art header along with command descriptions. It uses argparse to parse subcommands and prints a formatted help message. There are no external data sources or untrusted data sinks; the script only displays static content. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected. The ASCII art appears purely decorative. The overall structure and function are benign and typical for CLI help scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign CLI help display with colored ASCII art and command descriptions. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious data handling, or security risks identified. It appears to be a straightforward, static help interface without any malicious intent.",
