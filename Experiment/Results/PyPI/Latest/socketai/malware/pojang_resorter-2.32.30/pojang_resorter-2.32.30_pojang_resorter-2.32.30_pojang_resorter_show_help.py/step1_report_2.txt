{
  "purpose": "Provides a CLI tool with ASCII art and colored help messages for interacting with a hypothetical Python-Mojang related service.",
  "sources": "argparse argument parsing; colorama initialization and usage; printing ASCII art and help message",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output to network, files, or environment variables",
  "flows": "User runs the script, which displays styled help info; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Use of ASCII art and colored output is benign; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a function to display ASCII art and command help messages with color styling, and executes this function when run directly. The code does not read external input beyond command-line arguments, nor does it perform any network activity, data collection, or system modifications. All code components are typical for a CLI help display tool. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI help display script with stylized ASCII art and colored text. It does not contain malicious code, malware, or security risks. The use of colorama and argparse is standard and does not introduce any security concerns.",
