  "conclusion": "The script is a simple launcher that executes an external binary if present. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. The main security concern is trusting the external binary ('windows.exe'). The reports are consistent and reasonable, with low malware and obfuscation scores. The security risk is moderate, depending on the binary's trustworthiness. To improve security, verify the binary's integrity before execution. Overall, the code itself is benign, and the risk is external."
