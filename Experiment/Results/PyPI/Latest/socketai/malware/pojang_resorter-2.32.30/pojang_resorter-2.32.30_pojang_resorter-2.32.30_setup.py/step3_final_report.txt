{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and include a Windows executable as package data for the 'pojang_resorter' Python package.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including 'install_requires', 'entry_points', and 'package_data'. The executable 'libs/windows.exe' included in package_data.",
  "sinks": "None directly; the script only packages files without executing or processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; the script declares package configuration and includes static files.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe' in package data is unusual and warrants further verification but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The only noteworthy point is the inclusion of an executable file, which could be benign or malicious depending on its source. All reports correctly identify this as suspicious but do not attribute malicious intent solely based on its presence. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero; security risk is modest (~0.2-0.3) due to the executable's inclusion. No logical errors or vulnerabilities are detected. The scores are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code, with the caveat that the executable should be verified externally.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard. The main concern is the embedded 'libs/windows.exe', which should be inspected separately. Based on the code alone, there is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, security risk=0.2-0.3 depending on verification of the executable.",
