{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'pojang_resorter' Python project, including dependencies, entry points, and package data.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependencies, and package data from the setup() function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or user input are present; the code only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; setup configuration is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "The inclusion of a Windows executable ('libs/windows.exe') as package data could be unusual but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package info, dependencies, and console entry points. The only notable aspect is the inclusion of a Windows executable in package data, which may be intended for cross-platform support or optional components but could warrant further inspection if suspicious. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network communications, code injection, or obfuscated logic. No source-to-sink data flow risks are present, and the overall structure is typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal package setup script with no malicious behavior. The inclusion of an executable file is unusual but not necessarily malicious. Overall, the script is safe, with low security risk.",
