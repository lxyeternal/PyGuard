{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and installation of the 'pojang_resorter' Python project, specifying dependencies, entry points, and package data.",
  "sources": "The code reads package information, dependencies, and package data from the setup configuration.",
  "targets": "The installed package, including 'libs/windows.exe', and any code within 'pojang_resorter' modules when run.",
  "flows": "N/A in setup script; no data flow analysis applicable as the script only declares package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "The inclusion of a Windows executable ('libs/windows.exe') in package data could be suspicious if it is not documented or verified. Otherwise, no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No code execution, input handling, or untrusted data processing occurs here. The 'package_data' includes a Windows executable, which warrants verification to ensure it is legitimate and not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a typical package setup with no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard and does not contain malicious code or suspicious behavior. The inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe' should be verified for legitimacy, but the script itself is benign.",
