  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard. The main concern is the embedded 'libs/windows.exe', which should be inspected separately. Based on the code alone, there is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, security risk=0.2-0.3 depending on verification of the executable."
