  "conclusion": "The code is inherently insecure due to its capability to download and execute arbitrary remote files without validation, making it highly exploitable. While it does not contain embedded malicious payloads, its design enables malicious exploitation, warranting high security concern. The malware score should be increased to reflect this potential, and the overall security risk is high. The current implementation should be considered dangerous in untrusted environments and requires mitigation measures such as validation, checksum verification, and avoiding shell=True."
