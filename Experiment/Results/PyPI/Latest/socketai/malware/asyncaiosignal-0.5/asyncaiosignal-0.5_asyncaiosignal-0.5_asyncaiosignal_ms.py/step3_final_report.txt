{
  "purpose": "The code implements a keylogger that captures keystrokes and periodically exfiltrates the logs via Telegram. It also collects browser, system, and application data, then packages and sends this information to a remote server, all while operating stealthily in the background.",
  "sources": "Keyboard input via pynput, network requests to Telegram API, modules collecting browser/system data, environment variables, and process information.",
  "sinks": "Network POST requests to Telegram API, file storage for collected data, and in-memory data buffers for logs and system info.",
  "flows": "Keystrokes captured and stored in a log buffer, then periodically sent via Telegram; data from modules (browsers, system info) are packaged into zip files and uploaded; network requests flow from data collection points to Telegram endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, global SSL verification disabled, silent broad exception handling, background threading for continuous operation, no user notification or consent prompts.",
  "analysis": "The code demonstrates active malicious behaviors: persistent keylogging, covert data harvesting from browsers and system info, and exfiltration via Telegram API. The hardcoded credentials and SSL bypass facilitate undetected data theft and man-in-the-middle attacks. The silent exception handling conceals errors, increasing stealth. The code structure is straightforward without obfuscation, but the intent is clearly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This dependency functions as a malicious surveillance tool, capturing user keystrokes, harvesting sensitive data, and exfiltrating it covertly. The presence of hardcoded credentials, stealthy operation, and data theft mechanisms justify high malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated, and the malicious intent is evident, warranting maximum concern.",
