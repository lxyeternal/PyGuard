  "conclusion": "This dependency functions as a malicious surveillance tool, capturing user keystrokes, harvesting sensitive data, and exfiltrating it covertly. The presence of hardcoded credentials, stealthy operation, and data theft mechanisms justify high malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated, and the malicious intent is evident, warranting maximum concern."
