{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports several classes (Autostart, Message, Loader, Protector, Grabber) from local submodules and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module directory to import classes from other local files: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks in this snippet, as it does not perform any data processing, network communication, or potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing classes from local modules and exposing them; no data flows or external interactions are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code is straightforward and standard for Python module organization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes from local modules and defines the __all__ list for export. It lacks any input handling, data processing, or external communication. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The structure indicates a typical package __init__.py or module interface setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup that imports and exposes classes from other local modules. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation within this snippet.",
