  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module's __init__.py file that imports and exposes specific classes from its submodules for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local submodules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or processing logic; only imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward re-export of module components without additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes from sibling modules and defines an __all__ list for module exports. It does not process data, handle user input, or perform any operations that could introduce security risks. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure aligns with standard Python module design.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages namespace exports for its submodules.",
