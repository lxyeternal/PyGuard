{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to be a simple package __init__ file that exposes specific classes from local modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code only imports classes and defines __all__, with no data flow, input processing, or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are present. The modules' names might imply various functionalities, but nothing inherently malicious is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, serving as a module initializer to expose classes. There is no data processing, network activity, or code execution present. The module structure looks typical for Python packages. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package __init__ file that defines what classes are publicly accessible. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior based on the provided snippet.",
