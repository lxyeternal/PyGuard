  "purpose": "Module initialization and export of classes for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only imports and exports symbols without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py pattern that imports specific classes from sibling modules and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no executable logic, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a confidence of 1 and scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The structure is standard, and there are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
