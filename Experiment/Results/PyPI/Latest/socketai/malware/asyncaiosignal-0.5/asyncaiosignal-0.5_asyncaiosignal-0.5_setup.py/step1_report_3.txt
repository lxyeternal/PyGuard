{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'asyncaiosignal'. It specifies dependencies and packages to include.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from the setup configuration, including package name, version, required dependencies, and package discovery instructions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading static configuration data and passing it to the setup function; no dynamic or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The dependencies are explicitly specified with fixed versions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with explicit parameters. The only dependency is 'pynput==1.7.7', which is a standard library for input device control. The code is straightforward and does not include any dynamic code execution, environment variable usage, or malicious patterns. The package configuration appears typical for Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The dependencies are explicitly declared and do not exhibit suspicious behavior.",
