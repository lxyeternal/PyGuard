  "purpose": "A standard setup script for a Python package named 'asyncaiosignal' specifying dependencies and package discovery.",
  "sources": "The import of setuptools and the setup() function with explicit dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and calls setup() with static parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious code, obfuscation, or external data handling. The dependency 'pynput==1.7.7' is a legitimate library for input device control, and pinning a dependency is standard practice. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The minimal security risk score (0.1) in some reports reflects dependency considerations but does not indicate actual threat. The malware score remains 0, and obfuscation is absent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security risk score is justified by dependency pinning but does not represent an actual threat. All reports correctly assess the code as safe.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
