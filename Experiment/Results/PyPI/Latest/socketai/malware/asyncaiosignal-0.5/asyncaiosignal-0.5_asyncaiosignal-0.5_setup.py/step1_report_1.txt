{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging the Python project 'asyncaiosignal', specifying dependencies and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies ('install_requires') and package discovery via 'find_packages()'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines setup parameters without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging a Python project. It specifies the package name, version, required dependencies, and uses 'find_packages()' to include all sub-packages. The dependencies listed are specific (pynput==1.7.7), which appears typical for hardware or input device interaction libraries. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious behaviors. The script does not perform any network operations, data processing, or other activities beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is a legitimate and typical package configuration file with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
