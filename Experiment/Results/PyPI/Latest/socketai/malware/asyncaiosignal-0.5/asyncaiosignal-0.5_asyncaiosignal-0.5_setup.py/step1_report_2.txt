{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'asyncaiosignal' Python package, specifying dependencies and packages to include.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or malicious effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is static setup configuration without data flow or execution of untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a fixed, specific version of 'pynput' could be considered for reproducibility but is not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions from setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata including name, version, and required dependencies. It uses find_packages() to include all sub-packages. The dependency 'pynput==1.7.7' is explicitly pinned, which is a common practice. No user input, network operations, or code execution occurs here. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate setup configuration.",
