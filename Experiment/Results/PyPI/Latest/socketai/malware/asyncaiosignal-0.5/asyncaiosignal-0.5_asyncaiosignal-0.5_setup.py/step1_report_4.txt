{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'asyncaiosignal' Python package, specifying dependencies and packages.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the package's own setup parameters, particularly 'install_requires' specifying dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; setup script primarily installs dependencies and packages.",
  "flows": "The setup script reads package metadata and dependencies, which are used during installation, with no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behavior observed. The dependency 'pynput==1.7.7' is a standard library for input device control but warrants awareness of its capabilities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It defines package name, version, dependencies, and finds packages automatically. There are no suspicious functions, data flows, or obfuscated elements. The only dependency specified is 'pynput==1.7.7', which is a legitimate library used for input device control; no malicious intent is evident from its inclusion. The script performs typical package setup actions without any anomalous code or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no detectable malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily installs a known dependency and packages code for distribution.",
