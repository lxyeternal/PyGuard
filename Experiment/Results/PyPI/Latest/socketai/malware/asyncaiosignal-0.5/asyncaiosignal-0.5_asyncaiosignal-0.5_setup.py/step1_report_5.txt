{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for 'asyncaiosignal' including its dependencies and packages.",
  "sources": "The 'setup.py' script, primarily the 'install_requires' list and the 'find_packages()' function call.",
  "sinks": "Installation process and package metadata, with no evident untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified; the script configures package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a fixed specific version 'pynput==1.7.7' is normal for dependency pinning; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'asyncaiosignal'. It specifies a fixed dependency on 'pynput==1.7.7', which could be a concern if the version is maliciously altered, but as written, it is standard practice. The use of 'find_packages()' is typical for package discovery. There are no signs of code injection, untrusted input handling, or malicious code. The script simply prepares package metadata for distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no evident malicious intent or security issues. It is configured to package a Python project with a fixed dependency version. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
