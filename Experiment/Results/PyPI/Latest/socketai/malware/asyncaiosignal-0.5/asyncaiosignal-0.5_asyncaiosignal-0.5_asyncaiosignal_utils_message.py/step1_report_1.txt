  "sources": "Instantiation of MessageConfig object; call to windll.user32.MessageBoxW.",
  "sinks": "windll.user32.MessageBoxW function which displays a message box.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of MessageConfig -> __create_message_window -> windll.user32.MessageBoxW.",
  "anomalies": "Use of windll to invoke Windows API directly; no obvious anomalies in the code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a class to show a Windows message box with a message and title obtained from a configuration object. The message box is purely cosmetic, intended to mimic an error window. There are no suspicious data flows, no hardcoded credentials, and no network activity. The try-except block suppresses exceptions but does not perform malicious actions. Overall, the code appears to serve a benign purpose: displaying a fake message.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended to show a fake error message window, likely for user interface purposes. It does not contain any malware or malicious behavior based on the provided code. It is a straightforward implementation that does not perform any suspicious activities.",
