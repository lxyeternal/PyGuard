{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and enumerations from local submodules and defines an explicit list of exports for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .ms, .enums, and .utils.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only imports modules and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. No obfuscated code or unusual runtime behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports classes and constants from other modules within the package and declares an __all__ list for exports. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module initialization file. The imports are all local, with no external data sources or network activity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization segment that imports specific components and defines its API. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
