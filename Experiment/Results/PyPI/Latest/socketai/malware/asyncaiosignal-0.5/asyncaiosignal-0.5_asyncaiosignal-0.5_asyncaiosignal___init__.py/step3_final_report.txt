{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing specific classes, enums, and utilities from internal modules and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Local module imports (.ms, .enums, .utils) where data is read from internal package files.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements from internal modules to local namespace; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py or module interface file, importing classes and enums and defining __all__. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence scores and zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The structure and content are typical for a package's initialization file, with no signs of malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module initializer with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
  "malware": 0.0,
  "securityRisk": 0.0,
