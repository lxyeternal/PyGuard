  "purpose": "This code appears to be an __init__.py file for a Python package, exporting specific classes and enums for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .ms, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, external output or sensitive operations are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; just module imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module import and export functions, referencing local modules and exposing selected classes/enums. It does not include dynamic code execution, network operations, or any suspicious behavior. No obfuscation or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exposes internal components for external use.",
