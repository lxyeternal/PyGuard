{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package module that exports specific classes and enums for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules (.ms, .enums, .utils) and their classes or members.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks in this snippet; no data processing or untrusted input handling is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this minimal code snippet; it's mainly import and export statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports specific classes and enums from local modules and defines the __all__ list for module exports. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module interface file, indicating a straightforward design.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code functions as a module interface for exporting classes and enums, with no suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
