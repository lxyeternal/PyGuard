{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an __init__.py file that defines module exports for a package, facilitating access to classes and enums from other modules within the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .ms, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no handling of untrusted data or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling observed; only module imports and export definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily re-exports classes and constants for easier package interface management. It uses relative imports and defines __all__ for public API exposure. There are no signs of code injection, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. No suspicious logic, external network interactions, or data leaks are present. The simplicity and clarity suggest legitimate package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package __init__.py file that manages module exports with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security risks.",
