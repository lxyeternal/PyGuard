{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a package's __init__.py file, designed to import specific classes and enums for easier access when the package is imported.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and specific classes/enums from local package files (.ms, .enums, .utils). No external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or malicious actions are present; the code only performs import statements and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code does not process input or execute any dynamic code based on external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python package initialization practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enums from internal modules and exposes them via __all__ for package namespace control. It performs no data processing, external communication, or dynamic execution. The code structure is standard and does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical __init__.py file used for organizing package exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code is benign and safe.",
