  "conclusion": "The code is a benign abstract class with a significant security risk stemming from the SSL verification bypass method. No malware or obfuscation is present. The security concern is real but depends on how the method is invoked. Proper caution should be exercised to avoid calling '_create_unverified_https()' in production, as it can expose connections to MITM attacks."
