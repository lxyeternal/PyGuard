  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard anti-analysis environment detection tool. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, nor is it obfuscated or hidden. The scores should reflect this low threat level, with malware score at 0, obfuscated score near 0, and a low risk score (~0.2). While such techniques can be exploited maliciously, in this context, the code appears benign and intended for environment verification."
