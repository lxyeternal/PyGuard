  "purpose": "Defines the public interface for the sender module by exporting the AbstractSender class.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing AbstractSender from the sender module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external output sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs an import and export statement.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code; no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports AbstractSender from a relative sender module and specifies it as part of the module's public API via __all__. No data input, no external communication, and no logic that could be malicious. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a simple, benign module export statement.",
