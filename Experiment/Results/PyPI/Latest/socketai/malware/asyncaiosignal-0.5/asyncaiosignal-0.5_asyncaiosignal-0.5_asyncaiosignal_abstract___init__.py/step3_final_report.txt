  "purpose": "This code imports AbstractSender from a local sender module and exposes it via __all__ for public API.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .sender module",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input",
  "flows": "Import from sender module to __all__ list",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export, no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a simple import and defining __all__, with no data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence, zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present. The code's benign nature is well-supported by the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export statement with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the current scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
