  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' function or object from the local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'main' module within the same package, specifically the 'perm' component.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this single-line import statement; it does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak data.",
  "flows": "There is no data flow involved in this statement; it only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'perm' from a relative module 'main'. This is a standard Python import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. As it only performs a module import, there are no apparent security risks, malware behaviors, or anomalous code activities detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior, security issues, or anomalies identified. It appears to be a benign part of a larger codebase.",
