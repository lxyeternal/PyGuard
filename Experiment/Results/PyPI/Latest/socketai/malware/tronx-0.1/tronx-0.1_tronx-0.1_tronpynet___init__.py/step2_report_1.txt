  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the code in the snippet:**\n   - The code is a simple import statement: `from .main import perm`.\n   - All reports confirm this, and no additional code or behavior is described.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the simplicity of the code.\n   - They correctly identify that this is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero or near-zero, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any behavior that warrants a high risk score.\n   - The code only imports a symbol; it cannot execute malicious code by itself.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain very low or zero.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - Since the code only imports a symbol from a local module, there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n   - The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — the code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — import statements are benign unless combined with malicious code elsewhere.\n\n**Final note:**\n\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign import statement with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                               |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious activity; only an import statement             |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Clear, straightforward code; no obfuscation                |\n| Security Risk    | 0                 | No evidence of security issues; import is benign           |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
