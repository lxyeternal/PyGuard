  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe a single-line import statement: `from .main import perm`.\n- The code is minimal, standard Python import syntax, with no data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating the reports are consistent in identifying benign code.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, which aligns with the analysis that this is a simple import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify that the code is just an import statement with no malicious behavior.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Any errors or flawed reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports correctly conclude benign intent based on the minimal code snippet.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Are the assigned scores reasonable?**  \n  - `malware`: 0 or 0.9 — consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 — appropriate given the absence of any risky operations.\n  - `obfuscated`: 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n  - `risk`: 0 or 0.5 — generally low, with some reports at 0.9 for confidence, which seems high but acceptable given the context.\n\n### Justification for risk scores above 0.5:\n- The risk scores are mostly 0 or 0.9, which are reasonable. The only slightly higher scores (0.9) reflect high confidence that the code is benign, not actual risk.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- Since the code is only an import statement, **malware should be 0**.  \n- No evidence suggests malicious behavior, so all reports are correct in assigning malware scores of 0.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- Any claims about potential vulnerabilities based solely on import statements are unfounded.  \n- The reports do not assume malicious intent without evidence, which is correct.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **My own estimates:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n  - **Risk:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify this code as benign. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The import statement itself does not pose any security threat, and the analysis aligns with standard Python practices.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is a standard, safe import statement with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
