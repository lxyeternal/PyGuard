  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code imports from a relative module within the same package ('main').",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only an import statement; no source-to-sink paths here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; it only performs an import with no additional logic, no obfuscated code, and no secrets.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement from a relative module. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or execution of untrusted code. Since it's only an import, it cannot by itself be malicious or contain embedded malware. There is no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior based on this isolated line.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic import statement with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected. It is typical in Python modules and does not indicate any malware or security risks.",
