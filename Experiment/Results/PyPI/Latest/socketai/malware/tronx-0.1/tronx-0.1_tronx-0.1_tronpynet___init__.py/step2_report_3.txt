  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a single line of code: `from .main import perm`.\n- The code is a standard relative import within a Python package.\n- No data flows, sinks, or untrusted data handling are involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are noted.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with confidence levels mostly at 1, except for two reports at 0.9.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code snippet is a straightforward import statement. There are no signs of issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior.\n   - No evidence suggests the import could be malicious or dangerous.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that this is a benign import statement.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n   - The only minor note is the confidence level in some reports being slightly below 1, but given the simplicity, this is acceptable.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - All scores for malware and security risk are 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the code's simplicity.\n   - Confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for any higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code only imports a symbol from a local module, there is no basis for assigning any risk higher than 0.\n   - No signs of malicious code, external data handling, or suspicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's actual behavior.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code snippet's nature.\n   - Slight variations in confidence are acceptable given the minimal context.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThis code snippet is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious or security issues. All reports correctly identify this. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward: a simple import statement cannot be malicious or risky without additional context or code.",
