  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'perm' from a relative module, which does not read input or data directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data handling or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable within this single import statement; it merely loads a symbol from another module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, and the only notable aspect is the relative import, which is standard practice. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement that imports 'perm' from a module in the same package. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other operations that could be malicious. Since it is only an import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to import a symbol from a local module. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues.",
