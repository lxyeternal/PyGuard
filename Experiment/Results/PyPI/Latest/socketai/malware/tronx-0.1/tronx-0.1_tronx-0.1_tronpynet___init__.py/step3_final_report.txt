  "purpose": "Benign import statement importing 'perm' from a local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statement from the current package context.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths; the import is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement: 'from .main import perm'. It involves no data processing, network activity, or external inputs. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The import is syntactically correct and typical in Python packages. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of this code snippet. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are indicated or implied. The confidence in benign assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores and analysis are accurate; no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
