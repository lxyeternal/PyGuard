  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .main import perm`.\n- They consistently identify this as a straightforward relative import.\n- No reports indicate any suspicious activity, obfuscation, or embedded malicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0 or 0.9), reflecting the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code **does** contain the exact line: `from .main import perm`.\n- **No** anomalies, data flows, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- **No** evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The reports are accurate; this is a benign import statement.\n- No logical errors or issues are evident in the analysis.\n- The reasoning is consistent and sound.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign `0`. Since this is a simple import, there's no malware activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign `0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I agree with the reported scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**However,** considering the overall context:\n- If this import is part of a larger codebase, the import itself remains harmless.\n- There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code snippet is safe. No further action or concern is necessary based on this import statement alone.",
