  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'tronx' Python package, used to package and distribute the library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup functions, and specifying package requirements.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data output identified.",
  "flows": "Reading README content (source) -> setup configuration (sink); package dependencies specified without dynamic input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The setup script is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks: reading a README file for long description, defining package metadata, dependencies, author info, and repository URL. All operations are static and involve no user input or external untrusted data. No obfuscation, malicious payload, or suspicious behavior is evident. The dependencies and URLs appear legitimate. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
