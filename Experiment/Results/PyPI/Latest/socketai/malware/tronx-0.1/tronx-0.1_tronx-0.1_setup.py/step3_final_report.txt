  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, reading README.md for long description, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading local README.md file for long description; static metadata fields in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data handling or network activity",
  "flows": "Static data from README.md to long_description; static metadata to setup() parameters",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard setup script with no obfuscated or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It imports standard modules, reads a local README file, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No dynamic input, user interaction, or untrusted data processing is present. The code follows common practices, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports concur that the script is benign, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0. The URL points to a legitimate GitHub repository, and dependencies are standard. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is a standard, benign package configuration script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
