  "purpose": "Send private key data to an external API and fetch switcher status, likely for transaction purposes.",
  "sources": "The private_key parameter passed to perm(), and data from switcher.json() response.",
  "sinks": "Requests POST to external URL with transaction data; requests GET to fetch switcher status.",
  "flows": "Input private_key -> transaction_data (via POST) -> external API; GET request -> switcher.json() -> decision return.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a set syntax with a typo ('ptivat_key' instead of 'private_key'); sends sensitive private key data over network without encryption; no validation or sanitization of input; no error handling; hardcoded API URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code takes a private key as input, constructs a data set (with a typo in the key 'ptivat_key'), and posts it to a remote API. The private key is transmitted in plaintext, which poses security risks. The code then retrieves switcher data from another API endpoint to decide a return value. There are no obfuscation techniques or suspicious loops. The critical concern is the transmission of sensitive data (private key) over the network without security measures, indicating potential malicious intent or security negligence. The typo in 'ptivat_key' suggests the code might be poorly written or intentionally misleading. Overall, the code leaks sensitive information to an external server, which could be malicious or a significant security lapse.",
  "conclusion": "The script transmits private key data to an external server, which is highly suspicious and a serious security concern. It appears designed to exfiltrate sensitive information, indicating malicious behavior or severe negligence. The overall security risk is high.",
