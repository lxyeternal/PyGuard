  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with data exfiltration of private keys to external servers, with improper data structures and insecure transmission. Despite syntax errors preventing execution, the pattern indicates malicious or poorly designed code with high security risk. The scores assigned in reports are justified; the overall assessment points to a high likelihood of malicious intent."
