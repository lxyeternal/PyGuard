  "purpose": "The code retrieves a Google Cloud instance metadata token and exfiltrates it to an external server, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to 'http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token'",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to 'https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log' with the token data",
  "flows": "Source: token retrieval from metadata URL -> Sink: POST request sending token to external server",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional exfiltration of sensitive cloud metadata token without validation, user consent, or obfuscation; hardcoded external URL; straightforward code with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The script accesses the cloud metadata service to obtain an access token and immediately sends this token to an external server via HTTP POST. The process is unprotected, with no validation or encryption, and the URL is hardcoded. The code is simple and direct, with exception handling but no obfuscation or user interaction. This behavior aligns with malicious data exfiltration tactics, especially in cloud environments, indicating high malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs clear credential exfiltration from cloud metadata, representing malicious activity. The behavior is suspicious and potentially harmful, warranting high security concern.",
