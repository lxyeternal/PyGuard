  "flows": "Metadata token fetched from local GCE metadata server -> sent via POST to external server",
  "anomalies": "Accesses GCE metadata service, which could leak internal instance credentials if the token is sensitive; communicates with an external server with a hardcoded URL; no explicit hardcoded credentials or obfuscation, but behavior resembles credential exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to retrieve an access token from the GCE metadata service, which typically contains sensitive instance credentials. If successful, it sends this token to an external URL, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The code handles exceptions gracefully, avoiding crashes. The external communication indicates data exfiltration of potentially sensitive information. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are present; the behavior is straightforward but malicious in intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates GCE metadata tokens to an external server, indicating malicious intent to leak sensitive credentials. This constitutes a security risk and should be considered malicious behavior.",
