  "purpose": "The code attempts to exfiltrate Google Cloud instance metadata tokens during package installation by sending them to an external server.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to 'http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token'",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to 'https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log' with the token data",
  "flows": "Code executes send_token_to_server() during import, which retrieves the token from the metadata URL and sends it to the external server",
  "anomalies": "Automatic exfiltration of cloud metadata tokens during package setup; no obfuscation; external URL controlled by attacker",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly retrieves a cloud metadata token and exfiltrates it to an external server during package installation, indicating malicious intent. The process involves a network request to the internal metadata service and a subsequent POST to an external URL, both executed during module import. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the behavior is suspicious and unauthorized, constituting a supply chain attack. The external URL is suspicious, and the exfiltration of sensitive cloud credentials is a serious security concern. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1, securityRisk: 1, obfuscated: 0) are justified given the malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious credential exfiltration during package setup, representing a severe security threat. The behavior is clearly malicious, and the high scores are appropriate. The package should be flagged and avoided due to its malicious backdoor functionality.",
