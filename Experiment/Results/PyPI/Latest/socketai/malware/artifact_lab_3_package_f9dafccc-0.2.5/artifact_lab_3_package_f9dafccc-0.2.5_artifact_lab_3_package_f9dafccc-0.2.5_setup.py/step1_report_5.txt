{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to retrieve a Google Compute Engine instance token and exfiltrate it to an external server during the package setup process.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the Google Cloud metadata service at 'http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token'.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to 'https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log' via an HTTP POST request.",
  "flows": "The token retrieved from the metadata service flows directly to an external server through an HTTP POST request during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes network requests to external servers during the setup process, which is unusual and suspicious. It uses a hardcoded URL that appears to be a controlled or malicious endpoint. The attempt to access GCP metadata to steal tokens is a clear malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'requests' library and defines a function 'send_token_to_server' that retrieves an instance token from the Google Cloud metadata server. If successful, it posts this token to an external URL. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of cloud credentials during installation, which is malicious. The function is called immediately during module load, meaning this activity occurs automatically during package installation. The setup call is standard but is used here as a trigger point for malicious activity. The code is not obfuscated and uses straightforward Python syntax. The external endpoint looks suspicious and likely designed for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious activity by stealing cloud instance tokens and exfiltrating them to an external server during package installation. It is a malicious backdoor embedded in what appears to be a benign package. This poses a high security risk and should not be used.",
