{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up a Python package named 'matlibplot' with post-installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs: 'https://api.ipify.org' and the constructed webhook URL with system and network information.",
  "sinks": "Requests made via the 'requests' library to the webhook URL, potentially transmitting system and network info.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'send' function is called, which fetches the public IP, constructs a URL with system info, and sends data via an HTTP GET request to the webhook endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects system hostname, OS type, and external IP address and transmits them immediately after installation without user consent or notification. The URL used is a webhook, indicating potential data exfiltration. No user input validation or opt-out mechanism is present.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, upon execution, calls the 'send' function. This function retrieves the system's hostname and OS type, fetches the public IP address from 'https://api.ipify.org', constructs a URL with these data embedded as query parameters, and then sends an HTTP GET request to this URL. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation without explicit user consent, potentially leaking user system information to an external server. The use of a webhook URL suggests that data is being sent intentionally for tracking or malicious purposes. The code itself does not contain obfuscated elements, malicious code injection, or hardcoded credentials, but the behavior is suspicious due to data collection and transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a seemingly benign setup but includes a hidden behavior of collecting and transmitting system information to an external webhook during installation. This constitutes a privacy violation and potentially malicious data exfiltration. Overall, the package exhibits suspicious behavior indicative of malicious intent or security risk.",
