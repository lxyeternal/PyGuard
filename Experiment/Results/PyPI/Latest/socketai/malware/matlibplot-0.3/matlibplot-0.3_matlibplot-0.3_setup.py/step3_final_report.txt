{
  "purpose": "The code collects system hostname, OS information, and external IP address during installation, then exfiltrates this data to a remote webhook URL without user consent.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), platform.system(), requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')",
  "sinks": "requests.get(url) where url contains embedded system info sent to external webhook",
  "flows": "source functions (platform.node(), platform.system(), requests.get) -> URL construction -> requests.get to webhook",
  "anomalies": "Automatic data exfiltration during package installation without user notification; use of a suspicious webhook URL; package name mimicking a popular library",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send()' function that gathers hostname, OS, and external IP, then sends this data via a GET request to a remote webhook during the post-install process. The behavior is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The data transmission occurs silently, representing covert data exfiltration. The package name 'matlibplot' appears intentionally misspelled to mimic 'matplotlib,' indicating potential deception. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.75-0.9, security risk 0.75-0.9, obfuscated 0) are consistent with this behavior. Given the privacy invasion and data exfiltration, a malware score of approximately 0.85-0.9 and a security risk of 0.9 are justified. The behavior warrants high suspicion and caution, as it violates user privacy and could facilitate malicious tracking or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The package performs covert collection and transmission of system information during installation, representing malicious or highly suspicious behavior. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. It should be flagged as malicious or at least highly suspicious due to its privacy-invasive exfiltration activity.",
