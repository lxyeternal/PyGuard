{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup that installs dependencies and executes a post-installation function.",
  "sources": "requests.get('https://api.ipify.org') and requests.get(url) inside the send() function.",
  "sinks": "requests.get(url) sends data to an external webhook URL with system information.",
  "flows": "The system information (hostname, OS, external IP) is retrieved and then sent to an external webhook URL upon installation.",
  "anomalies": "The send() function performs an external network request during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The URL is dynamically constructed with system info and IP, which could be used for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup-related modules and defines a send() function that gathers system hostname, OS name, and external IP address, then sends this data to a specified webhook URL. The PostInstallCommand class overrides the run() method to call send() after the installation completes. During setup, the custom command is registered, ensuring send() executes after installation. The use of requests to send system info externally during package installation is suspicious, as it can facilitate user tracking or data leakage without user consent. No malicious payload such as data theft or system modification is present, but the behavior is unusual for a benign package.",
  "conclusion": "The package performs a network request during installation that transmits system information to an external server, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. This could be used for tracking or data collection without user awareness. The code itself does not modify or damage the system but exhibits behaviors typical of surveillance or data exfiltration techniques.",
