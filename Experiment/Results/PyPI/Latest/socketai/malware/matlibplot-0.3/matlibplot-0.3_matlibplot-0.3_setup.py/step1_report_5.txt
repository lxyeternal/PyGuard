{
  "purpose": "This setup script installs a Python package named 'matlibplot' and includes a post-install hook.",
  "sources": "The code reads the platform node name, the system type, and fetches the public IP address from an external API ('https://api.ipify.org') during the send() function execution.",
  "sinks": "The URL constructed in send() incorporates system and IP data and sends an HTTP GET request to a webhook URL ('https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55'), potentially transmitting sensitive information to an external server.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the system's node name, system type, and external IP API into URL formation, which then is used as a parameter in an HTTP request to a remote webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The send() function is executed automatically post-install, which is unusual for package installation scripts. It leaks system information to a remote server without user consent, which is suspicious. Use of the webhook URL for data exfiltration indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a send() function that collects system info and external IP address, then constructs a URL to send this data via an HTTP GET request. The post-install command overrides the default install behavior to execute send() after installation. This behavior can be malicious as it exfiltrates system details to an external server without user knowledge. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating malicious intent or at least a privacy violation. The package name 'matlibplot' resembles 'matplotlib,' which could be intended to deceive. The code is minimal but performs malicious data exfiltration during installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior; it exfiltrates system information to an external webhook during installation. The suspicious post-install hook and data leak point to malicious intent, with a high security risk. The overall risk score is high, and the package should be considered unsafe for use.",
