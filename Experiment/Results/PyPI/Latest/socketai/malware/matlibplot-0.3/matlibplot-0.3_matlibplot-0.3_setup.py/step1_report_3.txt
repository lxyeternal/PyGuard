{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a post-installation step to send system information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "The 'send()' function reads the system's hostname, OS platform, and external IP address via requests to 'https://api.ipify.org'. It also performs an HTTP GET request to the constructed URL.",
  "sinks": "The URL constructed in 'send()' is used in a GET request to an external webhook, potentially leaking system information without user consent.",
  "flows": "Input sources (platform.node(), platform.system(), external IP from 'api.ipify.org') flow into the URL string, which then acts as a sink when used in 'requests.get(url)'.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a network request to a webhook URL with embedded system info during installation without any user notification or consent. This behavior is suspicious and indicative of data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a custom install command. The 'send()' function, invoked during installation, gathers system hostname, OS info, and external IP address, then sends this data to a remote webhook URL. Such behavior is typically used for tracking or malicious data collection, especially since it occurs silently during package installation. The code uses standard modules and external requests, but its purpose to transmit system info without user approval is suspicious. There are no obfuscation techniques or hidden code fragments. The malicious activity is highly probable due to the data exfiltration pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation to an external URL. The code is straightforward but performs covert data collection, which is highly suspicious and dangerous.",
