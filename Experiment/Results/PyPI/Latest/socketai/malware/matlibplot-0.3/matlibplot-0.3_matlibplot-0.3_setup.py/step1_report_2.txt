  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that performs post-installation actions.",
  "sources": "The code reads platform information via platform.node() and platform.system(), and retrieves the public IP address via requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL is used in requests.get(), sending data to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Source: platform.node() and platform.system() + requests.get('https://api.ipify.org'). Text data from these sources flows into the URL, which is then used to make a GET request to a remote webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The send() function executes during post-installation, sending system hostname, OS info, and IP address to an external server without user consent or notification. The URL includes platform info and IP address in query parameters, and is sent via an external GET request.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script with a custom install command that runs a function 'send()' after installation. This function constructs a URL with system-specific data (hostname, OS, public IP) and makes a GET request to a remote webhook URL, transmitting potentially sensitive system information without user consent. The use of external requests during package installation, especially to a webhook URL with embedded system data, suggests malicious or at least privacy-intrusive behavior. The code does not perform any apparent security checks or validation, and the data collection is executed transparently during install, which is suspicious. The package name 'matlibplot' resembles 'matplotlib' but is misspelled, possibly to mimic a legitimate package while executing malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs covert data exfiltration during package installation by sending system hostname, OS, and IP address to an external webhook. This behavior indicates malicious intent or at least privacy violations. The package should be considered suspicious and potentially harmful, especially due to the unexpected data transmission during setup.",
