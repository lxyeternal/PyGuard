{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated code intended to decode and execute hidden payload, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided as a base64-encoded, reversed byte string within the lambda function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decompressed and decoded code via exec(), which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "The code reads the obfuscated payload, decodes it from base64, reverses the byte sequence, decompresses it with zlib, then executes the resulting code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string reversal, base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and exec() in an obfuscated manner to hide malicious payload. No visible legitimate purpose. The code is intentionally obfuscated to evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a lambda function that imports zlib and base64 modules. It then applies this lambda to a large base64-encoded string, reversed. After decoding, reversing, and decompressing, it executes the payload. Such obfuscation techniques are typical in malicious scripts aiming to conceal their true intent. The use of exec() on dynamically decompressed code is highly suspicious, as it allows arbitrary code execution with no visibility into what the payload does. The code has no clear input/output or legitimate functionality; its sole purpose appears to be hiding malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, using multiple obfuscation layers to hide its payload and executing it dynamically. It is indicative of malicious behavior, such as delivering a payload or backdoor. The code should be treated as malicious and should not be used.",
