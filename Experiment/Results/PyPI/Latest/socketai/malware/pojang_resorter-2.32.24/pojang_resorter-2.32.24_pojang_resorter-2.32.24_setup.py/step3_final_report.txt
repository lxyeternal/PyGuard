  "purpose": "Define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for the 'pojang_resorter' Python package.",
  "sources": "Dependencies listed in 'install_requires', entry point 'pojang-resorter' command, package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; setup script only declares configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup.py structure, no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py is a straightforward package configuration using setuptools, listing common dependencies for GUI automation, image processing, networking, and Discord interaction. No code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or maliciously obfuscated elements. The dependencies are widely used and do not indicate malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on external package trustworthiness, but the script itself is safe. Malware score is justified as 0, obfuscated score as 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) reflects the external dependency risks, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup configuration with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The dependency list and entry points are typical for such projects. The overall security risk is very low. The reports are accurate and consistent; no adjustments are necessary.",
