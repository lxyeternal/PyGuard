{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface with colored ASCII art and help information for a Python CLI tool related to Mojang interaction commands.",
  "sources": "argparse module for parsing command-line arguments, input parameters via command-line (subcommands).",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes or transmits untrusted data; it mainly displays static ASCII art and help info.",
  "flows": "User inputs command-line arguments, which are parsed and trigger display of help info and ASCII art.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Usage of colorama is straightforward; no dynamic execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama, defines a help display function with ASCII art and colored headers, and sets up argparse for subcommands. The subcommands are static and for help purposes only. No user input is processed beyond command-line arguments; no data transmission, credential handling, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help utility with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It only displays static ASCII art and help info based on user commands.",
