{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with a system, displaying help information, ASCII art, and available subcommands.",
  "sources": "Input is read from command-line arguments via argparse.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the print statement that outputs ASCII art, command headers, and help messages to the console.",
  "flows": "Input via command-line arguments influences the execution flow of the argparse parser, which then determines what help or commands are displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The ASCII art and color formatting are for UI enhancement only. The code does not perform network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for terminal text coloring, then defines a show_help() function that constructs ASCII art, sets color styles, configures argparse with several subcommands, and prints styled ASCII art and command help information. No user input data is processed beyond standard command-line arguments. The code only displays static help content with formatting, without executing any commands or performing malicious actions. There are no suspicious functions, no data leakage points, no code injection risks, and no external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI helper utility that displays styled ASCII art and command descriptions. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, does not handle sensitive data, and is purely for user interaction. The code appears safe with no security concerns.",
