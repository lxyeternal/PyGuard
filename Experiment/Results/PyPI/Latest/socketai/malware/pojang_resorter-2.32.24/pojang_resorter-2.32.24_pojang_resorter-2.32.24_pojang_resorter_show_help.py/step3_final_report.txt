  "purpose": "Display stylized ASCII art and command help information for a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument parsing via argparse; static ASCII art and help text output.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "User invokes command; argparse processes subcommands; ASCII art and help info are printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with static output, no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, initializes colorama, defines a function to display ASCII art and command descriptions with colored styling, and executes this function if run as main. It only outputs static ASCII art and help text, with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure is simple, and the purpose is purely for user interface enhancement. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI help utility that displays stylized ASCII art and command descriptions. It contains no malicious code, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero.",
