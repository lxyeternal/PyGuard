  "purpose": "A command-line utility that assigns operator privileges to a specified user by printing a confirmation message.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line argument (username).",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs a message; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input from argparse (username) flows directly into the print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts a username argument and prints a message indicating privilege assignment. It contains no external network calls, no data storage, no code obfuscation, and no malicious operations. The logic is simple and transparent. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or security flaws are present. The script's purpose appears to be a notification or placeholder for privilege assignment. Given its simplicity and lack of malicious features, it poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All review reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
