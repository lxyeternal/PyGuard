  "sources": "Imports from .main module, defines version and author metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow between sources and sinks; code is primarily metadata and import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a module docstring, an import statement, and metadata variables (__version__ and __author__). There are no dynamic code executions, data processing, or external communications. The import is a relative import from the same package, which is standard. The metadata variables are static strings. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package metadata and entry point definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
