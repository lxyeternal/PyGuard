{
  "purpose": "Provides the main entry point for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, including version and author metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'main' function from the local module '.main'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code simply imports and defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only metadata and a single import statement. No signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'main' from a local module, defines version and author metadata. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no network or system calls. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module initialization script with no signs of malware or security risks. It serves to set up package metadata and import the main function for CLI use.",
