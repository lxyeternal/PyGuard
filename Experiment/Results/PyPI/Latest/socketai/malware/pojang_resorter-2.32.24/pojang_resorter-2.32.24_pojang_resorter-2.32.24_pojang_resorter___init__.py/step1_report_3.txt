  "purpose": "Defines metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main import main",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present in the code",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "Lack of actual implementation code, only metadata and an import statement; no suspicious or unusual code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a main function from a local module, sets version and author metadata, and contains only comments. There are no data inputs, network activities, or sensitive operations present. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or metadata setup file. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package metadata and import stub with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
