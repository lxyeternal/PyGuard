  "purpose": "A minimal Python package module containing metadata and a local import, serving as an initialization or entry point for the package.",
  "sources": "Import from .main module, package metadata variables (__version__, __author__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network calls, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Import statement from local module; no data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and typical for package setup",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package initialization script with a docstring, a relative import, and metadata variables. No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's static and metadata-only nature. Confidence levels are high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. No logical flaws or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or modification is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
