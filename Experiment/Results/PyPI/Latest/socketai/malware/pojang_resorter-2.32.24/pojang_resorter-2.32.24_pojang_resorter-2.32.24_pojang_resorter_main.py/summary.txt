  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign and functional, serving as a command dispatcher for server management. It contains no malware or obfuscation. The primary security risks stem from the potential misuse of high-privilege commands ('nukeserver') and reliance on external modules, which could be malicious if compromised. The overall security posture should be considered moderate, with a malware score of 0 and a risk score around 0.5 to 0.6 depending on environment controls. Implementing safeguards and verifying external modules would improve security."
