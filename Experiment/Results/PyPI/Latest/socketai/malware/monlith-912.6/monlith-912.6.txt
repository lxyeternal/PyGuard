      "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of 'main()' during installation is suspicious and could be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful code. While the code is straightforward and not obfuscated, this pattern poses a significant security risk. The current reports' scores are reasonable but could be slightly increased to reflect the severity of executing unverified code during setup. Without inspecting 'main.py', the exact maliciousness cannot be confirmed, but the pattern warrants caution and further review."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious or at least privacy-invasive behavior through covert data collection and transmission to suspicious domains. The high malware and risk scores are justified and consistent with the observed activity. It should be flagged for further review or removal due to its potential for malicious exfiltration."
