  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() for each constructed URL",
  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current directory, random number) -> URL construction -> HTTP GET request to remote servers",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits hostname, username, current directory, and a random number to external domains; URLs appear suspicious and are hosted on questionable domains. No validation or consent prompts are present. The URLs are hardcoded and obfuscated, with no apparent legitimate purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script collects basic system info such as hostname, username, and current directory. It generates a random number to serve as an identifier. It then constructs URLs pointing to external servers, appending the collected data as URL parameters. The code attempts to open these URLs, likely to transmit the information. The use of multiple suspicious domains and automated data exfiltration without user consent suggests malicious intent. No data validation, encryption, or user notification is present. The URLs' domains and the pattern of sending system info indicate potential malicious or covert data collection behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect system information and send it to external servers, which is typical in data exfiltration or malicious tracking scripts. The use of suspicious domains and the lack of user consent or encryption raise security concerns. Overall, this code demonstrates malicious behavior with a high likelihood score.",
