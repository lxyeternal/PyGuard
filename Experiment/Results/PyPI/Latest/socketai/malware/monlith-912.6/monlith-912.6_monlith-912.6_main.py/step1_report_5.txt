  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending data to external URLs",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory) and a random number are sent via URL parameters to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration via URL requests to suspicious domains; use of random number as part of URL path; no clear benign purpose; potential for tracking or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, and current directory, then generates a random number. It constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and makes GET requests embedding the system data and random number as URL parameters. The URLs appear to be malicious or at least suspicious, possibly used for tracking or reconnaissance. The code does not validate or sanitize data but simply transmits system info to external servers, which indicates potentially malicious intent. The use of try-except blocks for network requests is typical, but the destination domains are untrusted and suspicious. No user input is used, and third-party libraries are not employed in a suspicious manner.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs benign-looking system information collection but transmits data to suspicious external domains without user consent, indicating possible malicious intent for tracking or reconnaissance. Overall, it exhibits malicious behavior based on data exfiltration to malicious domains.",
