{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'ccxt-mexc_futures'.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call, find_packages(), string literals for package metadata, and dependencies listed in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data; typical setup configuration with no data leaks or external data manipulation.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or obfuscated segments; standard setup script. No dynamic code execution or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools modules and uses them to configure package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no user inputs, external data sources, or runtime behaviors that could be exploited. The dependencies are common packages (ccxt, requests), and the metadata fields are either empty or standard. The code is straightforward and follows conventional patterns for Python package setup, with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python module. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
