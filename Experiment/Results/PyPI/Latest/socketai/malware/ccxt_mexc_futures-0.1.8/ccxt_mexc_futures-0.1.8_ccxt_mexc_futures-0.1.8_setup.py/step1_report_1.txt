{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python module named 'ccxt-mexc_futures' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; primarily static configuration parameters for packaging.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could cause vulnerabilities; no runtime data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; configuration data is static and used for package setup only.",
  "anomalies": "The author, author_email, and url fields are empty, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and dependencies. It specifies package requirements, versioning, and metadata without executing any code beyond setup configuration. No potential data leakage, malicious code, or supply chain threats are evident. The absence of runtime data handling or network interactions suggests no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no indicators of malicious behavior or security issues.",
