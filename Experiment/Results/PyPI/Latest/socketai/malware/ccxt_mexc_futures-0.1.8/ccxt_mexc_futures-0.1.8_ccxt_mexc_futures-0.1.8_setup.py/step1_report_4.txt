  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'ccxt-mexc_futures' Python module.",
  "sources": "Input data: package name, version, packages to include, description, author info, URL, dependencies, classifiers, and Python version requirements.",
  "sinks": "None of the data is used in sinks that could lead to security vulnerabilities or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., package metadata, dependencies) remains within setup configuration and does not flow into any insecure or malicious operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The script uses standard setup procedures without dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setuptools configuration for packaging a Python module. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers using standard practices. No external input handling, no dynamic code, and no suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns detected. The dependencies are common packages ('ccxt' and 'requests') and no data flows into insecure or malicious sinks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration for distributing a Python library.",
