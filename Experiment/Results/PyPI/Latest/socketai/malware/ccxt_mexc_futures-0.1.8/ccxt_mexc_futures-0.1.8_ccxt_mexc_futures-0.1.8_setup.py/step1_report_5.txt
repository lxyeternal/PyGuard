  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'ccxt-mexc_futures' Python module, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "User inputs for package metadata; find_packages() to discover local packages.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed during runtime.",
  "flows": "N/A; static setup configuration without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup.py structure. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No code execution, user input handling, or network activity is present. It does not contain obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The dependencies listed are common and benign. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection. Overall, the code appears standard and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is a legitimate, non-malicious package configuration file. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected. It is safe to use.",
