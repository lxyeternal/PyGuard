  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration for 'ccxt-mexc_futures' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static code reading package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers; no external data sources or user input.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author, author_email, and url fields; no obfuscated code or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script employing standard setuptools functions. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers without dynamic code, obfuscation, or external data handling. The empty author and url fields are unusual but not malicious. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with no suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the static, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign Python package setup script with no security issues or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the safe, standard nature of the code.",
