      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and could be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code. While there's no direct evidence of malicious intent, the behavior warrants a high security alert. The scores should be adjusted to reflect this risk, with malware around 0.7 and security risk around 0.75. Further inspection of 'main.py' is recommended to confirm safety."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration of system identifiers to suspicious external servers, indicating potentially malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. While it lacks destructive payloads, its exfiltration activity and suspicious URLs justify high security concern. The malware score should be around 0.75, and the security risk score around 0.8, reflecting the significant privacy and security implications."
