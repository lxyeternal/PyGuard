{
  "purpose": "The script collects system information such as hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current directory, then encodes the MAC addresses and sends this data as URL parameters to multiple remote servers.",
  "sources": "Input sources include platform.node() (hostname), getpass.getuser()() (username), os.getcwd() (current directory), and get_mac_addresses() (MAC addresses obtained via system commands).",
  "sinks": "The code sends HTTP GET requests to specified URLs with encoded system data as URL parameters using urllib.request.urlopen().",
  "flows": "Data flows from system info collection (sources) into URL parameter encoding and then into outbound HTTP requests (sinks) within the for loop over URLs.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs used are suspicious and obfuscated-looking; they are external, likely malicious domains. The code encodes MAC addresses in base64 before transmission, possibly to obscure the data. The script gathers MAC addresses, hostname, username, and directory without user consent. The exception handling silently suppresses errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves system identifiers such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses via platform-specific commands. MAC addresses are base64-encoded. It then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains with encoded MACs and other system info as URL parameters, and makes HTTP GET requests to these URLs. The URLs are suspicious, possibly used for exfiltration. No other malicious code such as payload execution or system modification is present. The silent exception handling may hide errors or malicious responses. The overall pattern indicates data exfiltration to malicious domains.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily collects system information and transmits it to external, suspicious domains without user consent, indicating potential data exfiltration. No direct malicious payloads are present, but the behavior and target URLs suggest malicious intent or at least undesirable privacy invasion.",
