{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to predefined external URLs via GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which executes system commands to obtain MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send collected data over the network to external domains.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, base64-encoded MAC addresses) flows from source functions into URL parameters, which are then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs used for data exfiltration appear suspicious; they are obfuscated or use domains that could be associated with malicious infrastructure. The base64 encoding of MAC addresses is potentially used to evade detection. No user input is directly taken, but the code transmits system info without apparent user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers sensitive system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses via system calls. It encodes MAC addresses in base64, then constructs URLs with these parameters, and sends HTTP GET requests to external domains. The URLs are non-standard and appear suspicious. There are no signs of obfuscation in the code itself, but the use of obscure URLs and data encoding suggests potential malicious intent. The code does not perform any malicious actions directly (e.g., file damage or system modification), but it collects and transmits potentially private data. No input validation issues are evident. The external domains could be used for command-and-control, data exfiltration, or tracking, indicating a high risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a data collection and exfiltration script targeting system information, with suspicious URLs suggesting malicious intent. It does not contain obfuscated code or direct malicious payloads, but its purpose and behavior are consistent with covert data transmission, warranting a high security risk assessment.",
