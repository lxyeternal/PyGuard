  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs encoded in base64 and URL parameters.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function, random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with embedded parameters, including encoded MAC addresses",
  "flows": "System info and encoded MAC addresses are collected, assembled into URL parameters, and sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external URLs possibly related to tracking or command and control servers; base64 encoding MAC addresses which may hide their content; lack of validation or encryption for the transmitted data.",
  "analysis": "The script collects host-specific data: hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, likely to obscure their content. It then constructs URLs pointing to potentially malicious domains and sends the collected data via GET requests. The use of hardcoded URLs with suspicious domain names and the transmission of MAC addresses suggest an intent to exfiltrate system identifiers, potentially for tracking or malicious purposes. The code does not perform any destructive actions but could be part of a supply chain attack or malware distribution, especially if embedded in a package with malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect and exfiltrate system information to external servers. It does not execute malicious payloads directly but could facilitate tracking, fingerprinting, or command-and-control activities. The external URLs and data handling raise suspicion of malicious intent, with a moderate malware score due to the data exfiltration behavior.",
