{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'importlibs_resource' package that installs dependencies and executes a function from main.py during installation.",
  "sources": "The script imports modules 'setuptools' and 'setuptools.command.install', and executes 'from main import main' during the custom install class run method.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function imported from main.py is called during installation, which could be a sink if 'main()' contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the custom 'run' method is executed, which then calls 'main()' from main.py; this is the source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes code from main.py during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious, especially if 'main()' is malicious or unknown.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses standard 'setuptools' functions to define package metadata and dependencies. The custom 'CrazyInstallStrat' class overrides 'run()' to execute 'main()' from main.py. This behavior is unconventional, as executing arbitrary code during installation can be exploited for malicious purposes. Without knowing the contents of main.py, this could be a malicious sink, potentially executing harmful code when the package is installed. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or other anomalies are present outside the dynamic execution of 'main()'.",
  "conclusion": "The package executes code from main.py during installation, which can be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful instructions. This behavior raises security concerns and warrants further investigation of main.py. Overall, the script itself appears normal except for the potentially malicious code execution during install.",
