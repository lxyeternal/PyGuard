  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and could be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code. While there's no direct evidence of malicious intent, the behavior warrants a high security alert. The scores should be adjusted to reflect this risk, with malware around 0.7 and security risk around 0.75. Further inspection of 'main.py' is recommended to confirm safety."
