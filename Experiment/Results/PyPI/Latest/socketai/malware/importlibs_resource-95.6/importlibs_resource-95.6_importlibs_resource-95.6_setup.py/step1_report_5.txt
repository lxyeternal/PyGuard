  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes a main function during installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules ('setuptools', 'install') and executes 'main()' from the 'main' module during installation.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'main()' from 'main' module could potentially be a sink if 'main' contains malicious code execution; however, no direct data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "During installation, the flow is: run custom install class -> execute 'main()' from 'main' module.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of 'main()' during setup is unusual; this could be used for malicious purposes if 'main()' contains malicious code, but the code itself is not shown here. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command 'CrazyInstallStrat' which, after performing the standard installation, calls 'main()' from the 'main' module. This could be used maliciously to execute arbitrary code at install time. The script requires 'requests' and 'psutil' packages, which are common dependencies. The overall structure is typical for a setup script, but the execution of an external 'main()' during install raises suspicion, especially if 'main()' contains malicious payloads. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or other malicious indicators are present in this snippet. The behavior depends on the contents of the 'main' module, which is unknown, so the malicious potential cannot be definitively determined but is flagged as suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with an unusual and potentially malicious behavior: executing 'main()' during installation. Without knowing the contents of 'main', this could be used to run malicious code upon package installation. The overall risk is elevated due to this execution pattern.",
