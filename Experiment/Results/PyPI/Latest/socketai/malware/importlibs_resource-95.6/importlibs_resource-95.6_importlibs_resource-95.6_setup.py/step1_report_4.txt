  "purpose": "Set up and install a Python package named 'importlibs_resource' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The import of 'main' inside the custom 'run' method in the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during installation, which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method calls 'main()' from 'main' module, potentially executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install command executes 'main()' during the installation process without any apparent validation or restriction. The 'main' module is imported dynamically during install, which is unusual and potentially risky if 'main' contains malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the 'run' method. This method executes 'install.run(self)' to perform standard installation, then imports 'main' and executes 'main()'. This behavior during setup is atypical and potentially dangerous, as it can execute arbitrary code during package installation. The setup configuration registers this custom command, so anytime the package is installed, 'main()' will be run, which could be malicious if 'main' contains malicious logic or is compromised. There are no visible safeguards, validation, or restrictions around the execution of 'main()', raising significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes an external 'main()' function during package installation, which could run malicious or unintended code. This behavior is suspicious and poses a security risk, especially if 'main' is malicious or compromised. No other malicious indicators are present, but this execution pattern itself is concerning.",
