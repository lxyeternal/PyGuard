  "conclusion": "The setup script's behavior of executing 'main()' during installation poses a high security risk, as it can be exploited for malicious purposes. Without inspecting 'main()', the exact maliciousness cannot be confirmed, but the pattern itself is dangerous and warrants caution. The scores should be adjusted to reflect the high potential for malicious activity, with malware and security risk scores around 0.75 to 0.8."
