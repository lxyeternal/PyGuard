  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'oclip' package, defining installation behavior and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'setuptools', custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat', and the call to 'main()' in the 'run' method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function from 'main' module during installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method executes 'main()' from 'main' module after standard installation steps.",
  "anomalies": "The 'run' method of the custom install class executes 'main()' from an external module immediately after installation, which could be suspicious if 'main()' performs malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The setup script extends the default install process by executing 'main()' from the 'main' module after installation. This behavior is unusual because package installation typically does not trigger code execution beyond setup routines. If 'main()' performs malicious actions, this could be a supply chain attack. The script itself does not contain malicious code or hardcoded credentials, but the execution of external code during install raises concern. Dependencies are standard and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears benign and typical for a setup script, but the invocation of 'main()' from an external module during installation is potentially malicious or maliciously intended. This behavior warrants further investigation of the 'main' module to ensure it does not execute harmful actions upon installation.",
