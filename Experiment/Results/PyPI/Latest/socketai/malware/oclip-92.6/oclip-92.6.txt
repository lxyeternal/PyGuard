      "conclusion": "The setup script's behavior of executing 'main()' during installation poses a high security risk, as it can be exploited for malicious purposes. Without inspecting 'main()', the exact maliciousness cannot be confirmed, but the pattern itself is dangerous and warrants caution. The scores should be adjusted to reflect the high potential for malicious activity, with malware and security risk scores around 0.75 to 0.8."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior to suspicious external domains, with no malicious payloads but significant privacy and security concerns. It should be classified as highly malicious in intent, with a malware score of 0.8 and a security risk score around 0.9. The code is not obfuscated beyond encoding MAC addresses, so obfuscation score remains low. Overall, it represents a serious security threat due to privacy invasion and covert data transfer."
