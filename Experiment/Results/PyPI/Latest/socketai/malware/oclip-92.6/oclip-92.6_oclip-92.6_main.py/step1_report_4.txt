  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, then encode and send this data to multiple remote URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node() (hostname), getpass.getuser() (username), os.getcwd() (current directory), get_mac_addresses() (MAC addresses)",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() (sends data over the network to external URLs)",
  "flows": "Collected data from sources is encoded and sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs as query parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple suspicious URLs with domains that do not appear legitimate; encodes MAC addresses in base64 before transmission, potentially obfuscating data; no clear user consent or purpose stated for data transmission; no validation or security checks on URLs or data.",
  "analysis": "The script collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, possibly to hide the data's nature. The code then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious, possibly malicious domains, appending the collected data as URL parameters. It attempts to connect to each URL, ignoring any exceptions, which suggests an intent to silently exfiltrate data. The use of hardcoded, suspicious domains and encoding techniques, combined with silent network requests, indicates malicious intent to gather and potentially exfiltrate system info without user awareness. No security safeguards or user consent mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for covertly collecting and transmitting system information to external, suspicious domains, indicative of malicious activity such as data exfiltration. The use of obfuscated encoding and suspicious URLs raises significant security concerns.",
