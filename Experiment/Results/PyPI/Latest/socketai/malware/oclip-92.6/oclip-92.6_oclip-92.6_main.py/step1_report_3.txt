  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then encode the MAC addresses and send this data via HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which reads system network configurations, and the list of URLs used for network requests.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() which sends the constructed HTTP requests containing system info to external URLs.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, encoded MAC addresses) is gathered and used as URL parameters, then sent over the network via HTTP GET to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "The code encodes MAC addresses and sends them to multiple external domains without any apparent user consent or indication of benign purpose. The URLs are suspicious and potentially malicious or used for tracking. No data validation or secure transmission is employed. The code suppresses exceptions silently, which may hide malicious activity or errors.",
  "analysis": "The script collects sensitive system information, including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current working directory. The MAC addresses are encoded in base64, then transmitted via GET requests to specific, suspicious URLs. The URLs contain seemingly random subdomains, indicating potential malicious or tracking intent. The network requests are executed silently, with exceptions ignored, which could hide malicious activity. The code does not perform any validation of responses or encryption, making data transmission insecure. No obfuscation or malicious payload is present beyond data exfiltration; however, the behavior of gathering and transmitting system data to untrusted domains without user consent indicates malicious intent or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to exfiltrate system information, including MAC addresses, to external, suspicious URLs. It operates stealthily by ignoring network errors. The purpose appears malicious, likely for tracking or unauthorized data collection. The overall security risk is high, with potential privacy violations and exfiltration behavior.",
