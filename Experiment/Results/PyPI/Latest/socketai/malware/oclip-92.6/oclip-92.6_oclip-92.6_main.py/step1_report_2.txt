  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it encoded to external URLs for tracking or profiling.",
  "sources": "platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which reads system-specific network interface data.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sends HTTP GET requests with system data to external domains.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered from sources, encoded (MAC addresses), then appended as URL parameters in HTTP requests sent to the specified external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple external URLs with suspicious domain names; encodes MAC addresses in base64 before transmission; no apparent purpose other than information exfiltration. No user interaction or clear benign purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and transmits this data to multiple external domains via GET requests. The domain names are obscure and suspicious, possibly malicious or tracking related. The code does not perform any harmful actions on the local system but potentially exfiltrates sensitive environment and hardware info without user consent. No obfuscation or suspicious language features are present, but the intent appears to be data collection and transmission, which could be used maliciously if done without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The script is primarily designed for information gathering and exfiltration. It does not perform destructive actions but could be part of a malicious supply chain component or tracking tool. The external URLs and data collection method raise security concerns. The overall risk is moderate, mainly due to the potential for privacy violations.",
