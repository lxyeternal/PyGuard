      "conclusion": "The code executes external code ('m()') during installation, which is a security concern and could be malicious if 'main.py' is harmful. The pattern is suspicious and warrants further investigation. The assigned scores are reasonable, but the risk should be considered high until 'main.py' is reviewed."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is malicious in intent, designed for covert data collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains. It uses mild obfuscation via base64 encoding, and its silent operation and hardware info harvesting suggest malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is significant."
