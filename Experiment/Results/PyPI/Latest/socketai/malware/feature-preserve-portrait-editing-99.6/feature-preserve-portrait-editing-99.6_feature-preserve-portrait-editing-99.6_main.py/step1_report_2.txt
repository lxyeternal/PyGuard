  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to remote servers via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (pltfrm.node()), username (gtps.getuser()), current working directory (osys.getcwd()), system command outputs ('getmac' or 'ifconfig') for MAC addresses, and generates random numbers (rndm.randint).",
  "sinks": "Sends data over HTTP GET requests to remote URLs using urllib.request.urlopen, with parameters including hostname, username, directory, MAC address, and a random number.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses, random number) is collected, encoded, and then sent via constructed URLs to external servers using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 encoding/decoding for URLs, which could be an obfuscation tactic. Sends data to multiple remote servers, which could be suspicious if not documented. No clear user interaction or explicit consent. Exception handling silently suppresses errors.",
  "analysis": "The code collects potentially sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses using platform-specific commands. It encodes MAC addresses with base64, constructs URLs with this data and other system info, and sends the data via HTTP GET requests to multiple remote URLs that are decoded from base64 strings. The URLs appear to be potentially malicious or at least privacy-invasive, as they transmit user/system data without explicit user consent. The use of base64 encoding for URLs and parameters might be an attempt to obfuscate the intentions. The code does not perform any malicious actions on the local system, but it transmits information to remote servers, which could be used for tracking or other malicious purposes. The silent exception handling avoids raising suspicion during network failures, which is common in malware to avoid detection.",
  "conclusion": "The script gathers system info and sends it to remote servers, indicating potentially malicious or privacy-invading behavior. Its primary function appears to be data exfiltration without user consent. While it does not perform destructive actions, its behavior is suspicious due to data collection and transmission to multiple external URLs.",
