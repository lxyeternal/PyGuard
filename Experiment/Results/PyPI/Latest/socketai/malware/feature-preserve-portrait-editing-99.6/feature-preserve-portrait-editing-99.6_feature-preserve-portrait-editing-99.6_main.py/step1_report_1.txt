  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC address, hostname, username, current directory) and send it via HTTP GET requests to multiple potentially malicious URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), gathers MAC addresses from system commands, generates random number, encodes data with base64.",
  "sinks": "Performs HTTP GET requests to external URLs with collected data as URL parameters; uses urllib.request.urlopen for network communication.",
  "flows": "System info is collected and encoded, then included as URL parameters in requests sent to external servers (URLs decoded from base64).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded base64-encoded URLs pointing to suspicious or untrusted domains, collection of system-specific info (hostname, username, MAC addresses), data is sent without user consent or obvious purpose, no validation or encryption of sensitive info.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hardware (MAC addresses), hostname, username, current directory, and a random number. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and constructs URLs from hardcoded base64 strings pointing to potentially malicious or suspicious domains. It then sends these data as URL parameters via GET requests. The code does not perform any validation or encryption beyond base64 encoding, and the URLs appear suspicious. The network activity is covert and could be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or data exfiltration. No clear benign purpose is evident, and the code operates silently, which raises suspicion of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect detailed system information and send it to external servers without user consent, using hardcoded URLs that suggest malicious or tracking behavior. The overall activity indicates potential malicious intent or privacy invasion, with no legitimate justification apparent. Therefore, it is considered malicious and risky to use.",
