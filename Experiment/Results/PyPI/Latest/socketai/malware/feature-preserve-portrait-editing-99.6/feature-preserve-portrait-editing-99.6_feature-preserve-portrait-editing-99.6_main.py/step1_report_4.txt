  "purpose": "Collect system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory, and send this data to remote servers via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Reading system info (platform.system(), platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), random number generation (random.randint), network URLs (hardcoded base64 URLs).",
  "sinks": "URL requests made through urllib.request.urlopen(), which send collected data to external servers.",
  "flows": "System info and user data are collected (sources), encoded or formatted, and then sent via HTTP GET requests to remote URLs (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded URLs obfuscates destination endpoints; no explicit data validation or sanitization. The URLs are hardcoded and repeatedly contacted, which might suggest command and control or data exfiltration attempts. No obvious user interaction or legitimate reason for this data transmission is present.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system-specific data: MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory, and a random number. It encodes MAC addresses in base64, constructs URLs (decoded from base64), and sends this information via HTTP GET requests. The URLs are hardcoded and obfuscated using base64, which is typical in malicious scripts trying to hide their destinations. The data flow involves collecting local machine info and exfiltrating it to external servers without user consent. There are no input validation or security controls around the network communication, and the purpose appears to be passive data collection possibly for malicious purposes such as tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to gather and exfiltrate system information to remote servers, using obfuscated URLs and hidden data transmission. The absence of user prompts or explicit user benefits, combined with obfuscation, suggests malicious intent or at least suspicious activity. It may be part of a spyware or backdoor mechanism.",
