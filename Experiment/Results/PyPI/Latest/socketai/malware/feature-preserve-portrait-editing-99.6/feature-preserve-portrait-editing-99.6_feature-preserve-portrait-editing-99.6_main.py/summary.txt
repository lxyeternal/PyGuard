  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious in intent, designed for covert data collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains. It uses mild obfuscation via base64 encoding, and its silent operation and hardware info harvesting suggest malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is significant."
