  "conclusion": "The code executes external code ('m()') during installation, which is a security concern and could be malicious if 'main.py' is harmful. The pattern is suspicious and warrants further investigation. The assigned scores are reasonable, but the risk should be considered high until 'main.py' is reviewed."
