  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that executes a function from main module after installation.",
  "sources": "The custom install command executes 'from main import m' and calls 'm()' during installation.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'm()' from main module, which could potentially execute arbitrary code if 'main.py' contains malicious logic.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install class runs and imports 'm' from main, then executes 'm()'.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of a post-install hook to execute arbitrary code; no other suspicious code or hardcoded credentials detected.",
  "analysis": "The setup script overrides the default install command to run a function 'm()' from a 'main' module upon installation. This could be exploited if 'main.py' contains malicious code, as it executes during package installation without user consent. No other malicious or suspicious code elements identified; the rest is standard setup procedures. The primary concern is the execution of external code ('m()') during install, which is a common vector for malicious behavior if 'main.py' is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a potentially arbitrary function 'm()' during installation, which could be malicious if 'main.py' is malicious. No other malicious indicators or obfuscation detected. The practice of running code during setup can be risky but is not inherently malicious without additional context.",
