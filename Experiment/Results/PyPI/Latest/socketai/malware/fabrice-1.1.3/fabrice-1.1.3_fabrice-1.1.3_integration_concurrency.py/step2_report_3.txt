  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe code that performs SSH connection handling, concurrency, and remote command execution on localhost.\n- No external or untrusted data sources are involved beyond the local word list.\n- The commands used are static and do not incorporate user input, reducing injection risk.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The use of 'skip()' indicates some tests are disabled, but this is typical for incomplete or environment-specific tests.\n- The code's purpose appears to be testing connection independence, threading, and correctness of remote command execution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:**  \n  The code is consistent with its described purpose: testing SSH connection independence, threading, and command execution. No issues with the core logic are evident.\n\n- **Malicious or suspicious code:**  \n  No signs of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code are present. The commands are benign, and the data flows are local and controlled.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and for testing purposes. No flawed assumptions are apparent.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and low security risk (~0.2). These are reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points per report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n\n- The reasoning is consistent and well justified.\n- The confidence levels are high (~0.9-0.95), which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- The use of 'skip()' is acknowledged as a test management detail, not a security concern.\n- No suspicious activity or code is identified.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n\n- The only minor concern could be the use of 'cxn.run()' with static commands, but since they are fixed and do not incorporate external input, the risk is minimal.\n- The tests are on localhost, which further reduces risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \nAll reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \nAll assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n**Risk score:**  \nGiven the benign nature, a low risk (~0.2) is appropriate. The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports and reasoning)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and the scores are appropriate. No further adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code is a standard testing utility for SSH connection handling and concurrency, with no malicious intent or security issues evident.",
