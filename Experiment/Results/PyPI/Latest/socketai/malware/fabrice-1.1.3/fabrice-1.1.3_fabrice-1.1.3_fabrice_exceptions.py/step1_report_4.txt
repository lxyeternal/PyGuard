  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions within a Python application or library.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; the code only defines exceptions without external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, defining custom exception classes with minimal logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. All are simple subclasses of Exception, with GroupException storing a result object. There are no input handling, data processing, network operations, or other behaviors that could be malicious. The code appears to be part of a larger codebase, focusing on error handling. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
