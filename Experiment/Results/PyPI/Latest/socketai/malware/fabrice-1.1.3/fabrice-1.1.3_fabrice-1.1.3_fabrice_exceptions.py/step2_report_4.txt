  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no data flows, external interactions, or runtime behaviors that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with no embedded logic beyond initializations.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n   - They emphasize the absence of data handling, external calls, or obfuscation, which is accurate.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1.0, which is justified given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no external interactions, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would be unjustified and could imply hidden malicious intent, which is not supported here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which is correct. No malicious behavior is present or implied.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions About Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The reports correctly dismiss potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions, recognizing that the code is just class definitions.\n   - No assumptions about hidden vulnerabilities are made, which is appropriate.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports, matching the benign analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are evident.\n\n**Overall Assessment & Recommendations**:\n\n- **Estimated Malware Score**: 0\n- **Estimated Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Estimated Security Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The current scoring accurately reflects this.\n\n**Final note**: No further action or concern is necessary based on this code snippet. It appears to be a standard, safe part of a larger codebase, likely serving as foundational exception handling classes.",
