  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env.\n- No data processing, external calls, or malicious code are present.\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly note the absence of data flow, external interaction, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- No logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign malware and securityRisk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- Confidence scores are 1.0, justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is justified.\n- Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions, there's no basis for higher risk.\n\n**Step 5: Malware score justification**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious intent or activity.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports assume that exception class definitions are benign, which is accurate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the code's scope.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores with the report**\n\n- All scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is benign, consisting solely of custom exception class definitions with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n- The code poses no security threat or malware risk.\n\n**Note:** If future code snippets include data handling, external calls, or obfuscated patterns, re-evaluation would be necessary. For now, this code is safe.",
