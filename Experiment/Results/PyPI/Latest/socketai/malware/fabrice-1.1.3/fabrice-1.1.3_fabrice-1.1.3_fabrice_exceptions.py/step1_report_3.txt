{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in a Python project, likely related to task management or environment handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their __init__ methods, which do not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward class definitions with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. No external data is read, no input/output operations are performed, and there are no dynamic code execution or security-sensitive functions. The classes are simple and serve as error indicators. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception class definitions for a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only standard exception class definitions with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is benign and primarily serves as part of a larger application or library. No security concerns are identified.",
