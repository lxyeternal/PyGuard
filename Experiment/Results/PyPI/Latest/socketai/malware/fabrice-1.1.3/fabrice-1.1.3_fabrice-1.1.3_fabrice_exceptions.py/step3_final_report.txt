{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for error handling, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exceptions; no data input, external calls, or environment interactions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or external data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code anomalies; straightforward class definitions with benign comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of simple exception class definitions with minimal logic, no data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. The classes are standard for error handling and do not contain any malicious patterns or vulnerabilities. The comments are benign and suggest possible future refactoring but do not impact security. Scores of malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
