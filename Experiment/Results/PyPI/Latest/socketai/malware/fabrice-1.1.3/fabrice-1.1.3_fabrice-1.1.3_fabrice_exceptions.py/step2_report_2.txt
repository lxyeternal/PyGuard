  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the associated code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - No data processing, external calls, or dynamic behavior.\n   - No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The comments are benign and suggest possible refactoring, but do not impact security.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - They appropriately note the absence of data flow, external interaction, or malicious patterns.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The confidence scores are 1.0, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions with no external or dynamic behavior, a risk score above 0.0 is unwarranted.\n   - The reports' scores of 0 align with this.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate, considering all factors, is identical:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and contains no indicators of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The provided reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.",
