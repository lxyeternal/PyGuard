  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code consists solely of simple class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no data inputs, external calls, or any runtime logic. The classes are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The comments and structure are benign and typical for error handling in Python.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is purely class definitions with no malicious or suspicious patterns. They emphasize the benign nature and the absence of data handling, external interactions, or obfuscation. There are no logical flaws or mistakes in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - malware: 0\n   - securityRisk: 0\n   - obfuscated: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n   Since the code is just exception classes, these scores are reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   The highest risk here is the potential for malicious code or obfuscation, which is clearly absent. The reports correctly assign zero scores, aligning with the code's benign nature.\n\n5. **Claims About Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is only class definitions with no malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. All reports agree on the benign nature, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThis code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final Recommendation**: No changes needed. The code poses no security threat or malware risk.",
