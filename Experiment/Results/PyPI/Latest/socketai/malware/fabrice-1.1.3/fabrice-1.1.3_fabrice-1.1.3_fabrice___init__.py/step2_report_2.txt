  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**1. Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is only import statements, no execution, data flow, or external communication. The report correctly identifies the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; no issues here.\n\n**2. Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; import statements only, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**3. Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—just static imports, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**4. Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, only import statements with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**5. Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; straightforward import statements, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is just a set of import statements. No dynamic code, no external calls, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Malware Score:** All zero, which is consistent with the code content.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Zero across all reports, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n\n- The reports assume that import statements alone cannot be malicious. This is generally correct unless the imported modules themselves are malicious or the import process is exploited (e.g., via malicious modules). Since these are internal modules, and there's no evidence of malicious content, the assessment stands.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- If any of the internal modules are compromised or malicious, the risk might increase, but based solely on this snippet, that cannot be determined.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores are consistent** with the code's content.\n- **No changes needed** based on the provided information.\n- **Risk scores** should remain at 0, malware at 0, obfuscated at 0.\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nGiven the code is purely import statements with no suspicious behavior, the current scores are appropriate. The overall malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should be:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and best practices for supply chain security assessment of such code snippets.",
