  "purpose": "Import statements for module components, likely setting up the package's namespace.",
  "sources": "Importing from internal module files (_version, connection, runners, group, tasks, executor).",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward, standard import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components and version information from internal modules, establishing the module's namespace. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted inputs. The structure appears typical for a Python package's __init__.py or main module, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard module import statements with no malicious behavior or security issues identified. It does not perform any operations beyond importing internal components.",
