  "purpose": "The code automates build, release, testing, and documentation tasks for a Python project using Invoke, with custom release procedures and environment manipulations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., 'TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION'), sys.path modifications, hardcoded credentials ('env.password', 'env.gateway', 'env.no_agent', 'sikrit', 'mypass', 'localghost', 'admin').",
  "sinks": "Connection configurations, environment setup commands, shell commands, and environment variables.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded secrets and environment variables influence connection setup and task execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded secrets, environment variable manipulations, sys.path modifications, and no obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code automates project tasks with insecure practices such as hardcoded secrets and sys.path modifications. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The security risk stems from exposure of secrets and insecure environment handling, but there is no active malicious behavior or malware present.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains insecure practices primarily related to secret management and environment manipulation, which pose moderate security risks but do not constitute active malware or malicious sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.4–0.6) are consistent and justified.",
