  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes automation tasks for release, testing, docs, etc.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Environment variables, sys.path modifications, hardcoded credentials.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets ('env.password', 'env.gateway', 'env.no_agent') and sys.path changes.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code detected; insecure practices (hardcoded secrets, sys.path manipulation) are present.\n- **Conclusion:** Moderate security risk, primarily due to insecure secrets, but no malware or active malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code does not contain malware or obfuscation.  \n- The security risk score of **0.45** seems reasonable given the insecure practices but no active threats.  \n- Malware score **0** is justified.  \n- Obfuscated **0** is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Manages packaging, testing, release workflows.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Hardcoded credentials ('sikrit', 'localghost', 'admin', 'mypass'), sys.path modifications.\n- **Anomalies:** Clear presence of secrets, environment variable manipulations.\n- **Analysis:** No active malicious behavior, but embedded secrets and environment manipulation pose risks.\n- **Conclusion:** Moderate risk, primarily due to secrets exposure, no malware.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The **0.5** security risk score is justified; it's slightly higher than Report 1, reflecting the explicit secrets.  \n- Malware **0** and obfuscated **0** are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines build, release, testing, docs tasks.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Hardcoded passwords ('sikrit', 'mypass'), environment variables.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets, environment variable manipulations.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to previous, no active malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Moderate risk, primarily from credential exposure.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The security risk score **0.4** seems slightly conservative; perhaps **0.5** could be justified, but it's acceptable.  \n- Malware **0**, obfuscated **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Automates build, release, testing workflows.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Hardcoded secrets ('sikrit', 'some-gateway', 'admin', 'localghost', 'mypass'), environment variables.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets, sys.path manipulation.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern—no active malicious code, but insecure secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Moderate risk, insecure handling of secrets.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The **0.6** security risk score is justified given the explicit secrets and environment manipulations.  \n- Malware **0**, obfuscated **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to others—build, release, testing.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Hardcoded secrets ('sikrit', 'mypass'), environment variables.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets, environment variable manipulations.\n- **Analysis:** No malware, just insecure practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Moderate risk, insecure secrets.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The **0.6** security risk score is consistent.  \n- Malware **0**, obfuscated **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** All reports correctly identify insecure practices—hardcoded secrets, sys.path modifications, environment variable manipulations.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware or obfuscation in any report.\n- **Scores:** The risk scores are generally reasonable, reflecting the insecure handling of secrets and environment manipulation, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The **malware scores** should remain **0** across all reports.\n- The **obfuscated scores** should remain **0**.\n- The **security risk scores** are appropriately set, though some could be slightly adjusted (e.g., Report 3 from 0.4 to 0.5), but current values are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Risk score:** Approximately 0.5, reflecting insecure secrets and environment practices, but no active threats.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code contains insecure practices (hardcoded secrets, sys.path modifications), which pose security risks but do not constitute malware or active malicious behavior. The current scoring aligns well with these findings.",
