{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'fabrice' or 'fabrice2' with dependencies and entry points for installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), file system (os.path, open), package files (version file, README), setup configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() call, which installs packages, dependencies, and creates executable scripts.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences package naming; reading version info from file; reading README content; calling setup() with all configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution outside standard pattern, no suspicious network calls, no obfuscated code, no hidden behaviors. The code reads version info from a file and environment variables to determine configuration, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical package setup with conditional naming based on environment variables and directory presence. It reads version info from a file without importing, uses standard dependencies, and defines an entry point for a console script. All operations are standard for Python packaging, with no suspicious code or behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It handles package configuration securely and predictably.",
