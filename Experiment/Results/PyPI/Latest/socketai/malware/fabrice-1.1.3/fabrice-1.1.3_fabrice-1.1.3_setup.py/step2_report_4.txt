  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The script performs standard setup tasks. The only potential concern is the use of `exec()` to load `_version.py`. However, this pattern is common in setup scripts for dynamic version loading.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent with no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, justified by the use of `exec()` on a local file, which could be malicious if `_version.py` is compromised.\n- **Conclusion:** The overall assessment aligns with the code's behavior. No issues found.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the `exec()` pattern as a minor concern.\n- **Malware score:** 0, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, same reasoning.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious intent detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** The script is straightforward, with no suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The only noteworthy point is the use of `exec()` to load `_version.py`. While this is a common pattern, it can be risky if `_version.py` is malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, justified due to `exec()` pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports are 0, which is correct given the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0.2, justified by the use of `exec()` on local files, which could be malicious if `_version.py` is compromised.\n\n### My own evaluation:\n- The code is a typical setup script with standard practices.\n- The use of `exec()` to read `_version.py` is a known pattern but warrants caution. If `_version.py` is controlled and verified, the risk is minimal.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The overall security risk remains low, but the pattern of executing local code should be acknowledged as a minor concern.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**In conclusion,** I agree with the given scores and reasoning. The code is benign, with a minor caveat about executing local version files, which is standard practice but should be verified in trusted environments.",
