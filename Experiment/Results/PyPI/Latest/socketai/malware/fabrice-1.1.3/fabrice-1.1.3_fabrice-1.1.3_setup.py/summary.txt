  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup with minimal security concerns. The primary point of caution is the use of 'exec()' to load version info, which should be trusted and verified. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk is low, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a slight risk score of 0.2 due to 'exec()' usage."
