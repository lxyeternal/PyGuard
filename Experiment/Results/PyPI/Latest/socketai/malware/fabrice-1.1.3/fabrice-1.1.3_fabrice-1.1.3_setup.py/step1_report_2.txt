{
  "purpose": "This script is used to configure and set up a Python package named 'fabrice' or 'fabrice2' for distribution, handling dependencies, version info, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', filesystem checks for directories 'fabric2' and 'fabric', reading '_version.py' and 'README.rst' files, and static strings in setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the code executes content from '_version.py' using 'exec', which could be malicious if '_version.py' is tampered with, and reads files without validation. No other unsafe data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory existence checks influence package naming; reading '_version.py' and 'README.rst' feeds data into variables; 'exec' executes the version file content; setup parameters use static and dynamically loaded data.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'exec' on a file that defines version information is unusual and potentially risky if the file is compromised. No other anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package. The only notable concern is the use of 'exec' to load version information from a file, which could be exploited if that file is maliciously altered. All other code appears conventional and benign. No suspicious network activity, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a typical setup script with a minor security concern regarding the use of 'exec' on an external file. No malicious intent or malware indicators are present. Overall security risk is low, but the use of 'exec' warrants caution if '_version.py' could be compromised.",
