{
  "purpose": "The script configures a Python package 'fabrice', determining package and binary names based on environment variables and directory structure, reads version info from a local '_version.py' file, and sets up package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', directory checks for 'fabric' and 'fabric2', reading '_version.py' file, reading 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'exec()' on '_version.py', reading files, setting up package via setuptools.setup()",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences package/binary name -> directory checks -> reading '_version.py' -> executing '_version.py' via exec() -> setup configuration",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec()' to load version info from '_version.py' could be risky if the file is compromised; no other anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with environment variables and directory checks influencing package configuration. It reads version info from a local '_version.py' file using 'exec()', which is a common pattern but can be risky if the file is malicious. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The use of 'exec()' warrants caution but is typical in such scripts. The overall structure and behavior are straightforward and safe, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup with minimal security concerns. The primary point of caution is the use of 'exec()' to load version info, which should be trusted and verified. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk is low, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a slight risk score of 0.2 due to 'exec()' usage.",
