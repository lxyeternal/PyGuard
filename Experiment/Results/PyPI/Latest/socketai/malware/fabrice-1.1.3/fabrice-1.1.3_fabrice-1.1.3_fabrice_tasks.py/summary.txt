  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a wrapper for remote task execution with support for multiple hosts. The main security concern is handling untrusted input for connection parameters, which should be validated in deployment. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low risk (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
