{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package with custom installation behavior that fetches external data and modifies user shell configuration files.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen(url) reads data from an external URL; open() reads and writes to ~/.fleetwood.py, ~/.zshrc, and ~/.bash_profile.",
  "sinks": "Writing to ~/.fleetwood.py, ~/.zshrc, and ~/.bash_profile; potentially executing or sourcing downloaded or written scripts.",
  "flows": "External URL data is downloaded and saved to ~/.fleetwood.py, then the content 'python3 ~/.fleetwood.py' is appended to user shell configuration files, enabling automatic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Automatically modifying user shell configuration files to include a remote script without validation; fetching external data during package installation can be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches a script from an external URL during installation, saving it locally. It then appends a command to execute this script in user's shell config files, which can lead to remote code execution upon shell startup. The code silently ignores errors, which may hide malicious failures. This behavior enables remote code execution and persistent backdoors if the fetched script is malicious, representing significant security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates potentially malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote scripts during installation and modifying user shell configurations without validation. This poses high security risks, including remote code execution and persistent backdoors.",
