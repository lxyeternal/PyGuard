  "purpose": "This file initializes the test package by importing 'test_function' from 'module1' and exposing it for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .module1 import test_function",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows identified",
  "flows": "Import source to module namespace; no data flow from external sources to sinks observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer that imports a function from a sibling module and defines the public interface via __all__. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or external communications are present. It serves as a typical test package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
