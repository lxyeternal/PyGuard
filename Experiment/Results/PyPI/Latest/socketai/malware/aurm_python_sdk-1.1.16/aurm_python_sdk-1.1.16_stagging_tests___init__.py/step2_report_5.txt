  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports describe the code as a straightforward package initializer that imports a function from a sibling module and exposes it via `__all__`. The original code confirms this. There are no dynamic executions, input handling, or suspicious patterns mentioned.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent in their description: all recognize the code as standard, benign package initialization.  \n- They correctly identify that no malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks are present.  \n- The analysis and conclusions are aligned with the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.  \n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- Since all reports indicate no malicious intent, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors, the risk scores should remain at 0.  \n- Any higher score would be unjustified unless new evidence emerges.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code analysis.  \n- No malicious behavior is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- All reports are cautious but reasonable, given the simplicity of the code.  \n- They avoid assumptions about hidden behaviors or malicious intent, which is appropriate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: all zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code is a typical package initializer with no security concerns.\n- No changes needed to the scores or analysis.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores appropriately reflect that. No adjustments are necessary.",
