{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer that imports a function from a sibling module and exposes it via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the module '.module1' to import 'test_function'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not handle input or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement from '.module1', which is then exposed via __all__, with no further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward and standard for Python package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py file that imports a function from a sibling module and exposes it. It contains no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
