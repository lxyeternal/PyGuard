  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static string, serving as a benign test or placeholder.",
  "sources": "The function does not read external input or data; it contains only a static return statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process or output external data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function simply returns a fixed string without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single, static function with no inputs, external calls, or data processing. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent and justified. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
