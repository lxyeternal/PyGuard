  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content**:  \nThe code is a single function `test_function()` that returns a static string `\"Hello from module uno!\"`. There are no inputs, external calls, data processing, or other suspicious behaviors.\n\n2. **Report Consistency**:  \nAll reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves as a simple test or placeholder. They consistently note the absence of external data, sinks, flows, anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n\n- **Obfuscated Score (0)**:  \nCorrect. The code is clear and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Malware Score (0)**:  \nCorrect. There is no malicious behavior, payload, or suspicious activity.\n\n- **Security Risk Score (0)**:  \nCorrect. The code does not introduce any security risk—no inputs, no external calls, no sensitive data handling.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Flaws**:  \nNo issues are present. The reports are thorough and consistent. No assumptions are being made beyond what the code shows.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, the scores assigned are appropriate. The confidence level of 1 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score**: Remain at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score**: Remain at 0, code is clear.\n- **Risk score**: Remain at 0, no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No modifications needed to the scores.\n- The code is entirely benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimates**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the existing assessments.",
