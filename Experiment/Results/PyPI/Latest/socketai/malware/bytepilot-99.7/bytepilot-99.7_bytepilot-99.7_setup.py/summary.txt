  "conclusion": "The code executes external code ('main()') during installation, which poses a significant security risk. Without verifying the safety of 'main()', this pattern can be exploited for malicious purposes. The scores should reflect a high likelihood of malicious behavior and security risk, with malware score around 0.75 and overall risk also approximately 0.75. The code itself is straightforward and not obfuscated, so obfuscation score remains 0."
