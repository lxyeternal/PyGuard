  "purpose": "Collects system information (hostname, username, current directory) and sends it to multiple remote URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() (sending data over the network)",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory) → URL parameters → HTTP request to remote servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious URLs with 'oast' domains, which are often used for security testing or tracking. No user consent or encryption is evident. No apparent purpose other than data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, and current directory, then constructs URLs embedding this information along with a random number. It makes HTTP GET requests to these URLs, which are likely controlled by an attacker or third-party. The URLs suggest potential malicious or tracking behavior, especially since they are non-standard and include 'oast' domains, commonly used in security testing or surveillance. There are no apparent safeguards, encryption, or user notifications. The script operates silently in the background, indicating malicious intent or at least suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to collect system information and send it to external servers without user consent, indicating malicious or tracking behavior. The use of suspicious URLs and data collection points increases concern about potential malicious intent.",
