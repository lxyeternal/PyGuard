  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current path) -> URL parameters -> HTTP request to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Sending system details to external, potentially suspicious domains; no explicit user consent or encryption; use of random number for URL query; multiple domains that are obscure; no response handling beyond logging",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, and current working directory. It generates a random number to append to URLs. It then constructs GET requests to three external domains, appending system info as URL parameters. The code attempts to reach these URLs and logs responses or errors. The external URLs are obscure and appear suspicious, possibly indicating data exfiltration or tracking. The use of multiple domains and the nature of the URLs suggest malicious intent or at least tracking behavior. No user input validation, no data encryption, and no clear purpose provided. This pattern resembles malware or spyware behavior aiming to collect system info covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to send system information to suspicious external servers without user consent, indicating malicious or maliciously motivated tracking behavior. The code lacks any legitimate justification and poses security risks.",
