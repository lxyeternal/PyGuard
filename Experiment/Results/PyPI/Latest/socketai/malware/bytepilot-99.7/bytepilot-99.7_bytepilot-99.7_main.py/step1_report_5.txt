  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to remote URLs for tracking or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, username, and current working directory; generates a random number.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests to remote URLs with embedded system info and a random number as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory) + random number -> URL parameters -> HTTP request to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious URLs with obfuscated domains, collecting system info and sending it externally without user consent; no explicit user interaction or indication of purpose; logging responses without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers environment information such as hostname, username, and current directory. It then generates a random number within a specified range. This data, along with a list of potentially malicious or suspicious URLs, is sent via HTTP GET requests. The URLs appear obfuscated or malicious, potentially indicating tracking or exfiltration activities. The use of try-except for network requests is standard, but the nature of URLs and data collection suggests possible privacy invasion or malicious intent. There are no signs of code obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors; however, the external communication to suspicious domains combined with system data collection raises concerns about privacy and security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system details and transmits them to suspicious external URLs, indicating potential privacy violation or malicious monitoring behavior. It does not appear to contain embedded malware or backdoors but poses a security concern due to data exfiltration to suspicious domains.",
