      "conclusion": "The code executes external code ('main()') during installation, which poses a significant security risk. Without verifying the safety of 'main()', this pattern can be exploited for malicious purposes. The scores should reflect a high likelihood of malicious behavior and security risk, with malware score around 0.75 and overall risk also approximately 0.75. The code itself is straightforward and not obfuscated, so obfuscation score remains 0."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious data collection and exfiltration behavior to obscure external domains, justifying high security risk scores. However, it lacks actual malware payloads, so malware scores should be lowered accordingly. The activity is concerning but not definitively malicious payload delivery. Adjusted scores: malware approximately 0.2-0.3, security risk around 0.75, obfuscation 0."
