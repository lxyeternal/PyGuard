{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configurations for a Python package, with custom commands that execute a dynamic code evaluation during installation, development, or egg info generation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string variables assigned within the 'custom_command' function, and the 'setup' parameters.",
  "sinks": "The eval() function executes code constructed from concatenated strings, potentially executing malicious or arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The string concatenations (wombo, combo, funky_town) are built from static variables and then combined to form a string that is executed with eval().",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on dynamically constructed strings is highly suspicious; the string components are hardcoded but are assembled in a way that can obfuscate malicious code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up a package but includes a function 'custom_command' that constructs a string using multiple string variables. This string is then executed with eval(), which can run arbitrary code. The concatenation suggests obfuscation, possibly to hide malicious intent. The eval() call is executed during standard setup commands (install, develop, egg_info), meaning code could run automatically during package installation or development setup. No external inputs are used, but the obfuscation and eval() indicate potential malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be malicious or at least suspicious due to the use of eval() with dynamically constructed strings during package setup commands. This technique could allow hidden code execution, representing a supply chain security risk. It warrants caution and further review before use.",
