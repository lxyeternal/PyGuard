  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static greeting string, likely used as a placeholder or test.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or environment variables; static code with no data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output external data or perform network/file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function simply returns a static string without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward and minimal code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic function with no external dependencies, inputs, or side effects. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code lacks any malicious or suspicious behavior, and the assessments are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications to scores or analysis are necessary.",
