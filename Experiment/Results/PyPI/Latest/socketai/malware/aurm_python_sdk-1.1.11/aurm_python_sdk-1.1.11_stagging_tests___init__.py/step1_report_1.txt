  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py file that imports 'test_function' from a sibling module 'module1' and declares it in __all__ for external accessibility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is minimal and standard for Python package initialization.",
