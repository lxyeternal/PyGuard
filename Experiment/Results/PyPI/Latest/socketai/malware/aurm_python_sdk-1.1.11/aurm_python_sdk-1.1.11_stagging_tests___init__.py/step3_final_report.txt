  "purpose": "Standard Python package initialization file that imports a function from a module and exposes it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Static import statement from .module1, no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import from .module1 to __all__ assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static import and export statement, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py that imports test_function from a local module and exposes it. No dynamic execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are evident, and the code aligns with standard package initialization practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious or security concerns. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or re-evaluation are necessary.",
