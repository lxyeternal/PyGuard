  "purpose": "Static package metadata declarations for the 'requests' library, including version, author, and description.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments defining package metadata (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.). No data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, network calls, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignments do not involve data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative ASCII art comment; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with an ASCII art comment. No dynamic code, input/output, network activity, or obfuscation is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with confidence scores of 1. The code is a standard __init__.py or metadata file, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
