  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**  \n   - **Findings:** Only static variable assignments for package metadata; ASCII art comment is decorative. No dynamic code, input, or network activity.  \n   - **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n   - **Risk score:** 0 — justified, as there's no security concern.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n2. **Report 2**  \n   - **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, static metadata variables with no suspicious activity.  \n   - **Scores:** All scores are 1.0 for confidence and 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the analysis.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n3. **Report 3**  \n   - **Findings:** Again, straightforward static metadata assignments with no suspicious or malicious code.  \n   - **Scores:** All at 1.0 confidence, malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n4. **Report 4**  \n   - **Findings:** Same as above; no dynamic or malicious activity detected.  \n   - **Scores:** All scores consistent with the benign nature.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n5. **Report 5**  \n   - **Findings:** Only static package metadata; no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.  \n   - **Scores:** All appropriate.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code snippets are simple variable assignments for package metadata, with no malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the static nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since there's no security risk or suspicious activity.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward assignments with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security issues.\n\n**Summary:** The code is purely metadata declaration for the 'requests' package, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
