  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code only assigns values to variables.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; purely static metadata assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual comments with ASCII art, but no malicious or suspicious code activity.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains variable assignments for package metadata, including title, description, URL, version, author info, and license. There are no inputs, outputs, network calls, or code execution elements. The ASCII art comment does not impact functionality. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward metadata declaration for the 'requests' library with no malicious intent or security issues.",
