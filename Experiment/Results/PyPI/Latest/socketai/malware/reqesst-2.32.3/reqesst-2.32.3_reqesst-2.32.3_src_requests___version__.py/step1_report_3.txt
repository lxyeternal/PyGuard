  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and other information.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static metadata assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only metadata declarations with no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package metadata declaration, typical for a Python package's __init__.py or similar file. It includes version info, author details, license, and a decorative ASCII art banner. There are no inputs, outputs, or executable code that could indicate malicious behavior. The content appears to be purely informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as package metadata with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
