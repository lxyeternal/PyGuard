  "purpose": "Defines package metadata for the 'requests' Python library, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or untrusted data sources; only static metadata assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks, network calls, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of straightforward metadata declarations with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple set of variable assignments providing package metadata, which is typical for Python modules. It contains no dynamic execution, no external input handling, and no suspicious logic or network activity. The ASCII art at the beginning appears to be decorative and unrelated to code execution or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code fragment. It is a standard package metadata declaration.",
