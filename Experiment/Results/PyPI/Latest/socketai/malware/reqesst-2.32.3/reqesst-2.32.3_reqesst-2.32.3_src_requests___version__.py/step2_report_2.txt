  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static metadata variable assignments for the 'requests' package.\n- No inputs, outputs, network calls, code execution, or dynamic behavior are present.\n- The ASCII art is decorative and not suspicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are detected.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Metadata declaration.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies no malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as above, consistent and correct.\n- **Scores:** All zeros for malware and security risk, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion, standard package metadata.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same analysis, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others, purely static metadata.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code only contains static variable assignments for package metadata.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent, accurate, and thorough.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All are 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, with confidence=1. These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports suggest any malicious or risky behavior. The code is purely declarative.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Since no malicious activity is present, malware=0 is correct.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  No unwarranted assumptions are made; all conclusions are based on static analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, benign package metadata declaration with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed; all reports are accurate. The overall security posture of this code is benign.",
