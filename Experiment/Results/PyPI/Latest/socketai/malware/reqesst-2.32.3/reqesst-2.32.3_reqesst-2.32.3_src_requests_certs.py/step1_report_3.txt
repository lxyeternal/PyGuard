{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, mainly for environment configuration or packaging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location from the 'certifi' package via 'where()' function.",
  "sinks": "The printed output is simply the path to the CA bundle; no sinks for untrusted data or malicious behavior are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing 'where' from 'certifi' and printing its value, with no untrusted data flow or external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package and prints its output. This function returns a static path to the CA bundle, which is a standard and safe operation. The code lacks any network activity, user input, or dynamic behavior. It does not contain obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Its purpose is to reveal the CA bundle location, which is typical for configuration or packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to output the path to the default CA certificates bundle. It performs a simple, safe operation without any malicious intent or security risks.",
