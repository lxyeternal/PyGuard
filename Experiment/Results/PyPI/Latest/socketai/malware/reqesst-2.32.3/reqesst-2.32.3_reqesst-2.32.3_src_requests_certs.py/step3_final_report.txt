  "purpose": "Outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' and the call to 'where()' function.",
  "sinks": "The printed output of the CA bundle path; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' -> call to 'where()' -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted function from a well-known library and prints its static return value. It performs no data manipulation, network activity, or user input handling. The purpose is informational, revealing the location of the CA bundle used for SSL verification. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is present. The code is simple, clear, and relies on a trusted library, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that outputs the CA bundle path from 'certifi'. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious code, and is safe for use. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
