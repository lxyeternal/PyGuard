{
  "purpose": "To provide the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location via 'where()' imported from certifi.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leakage or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The script calls 'where()' and prints its output, which is a static path to a CA bundle; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. The code is straightforward and uses standard library/package functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the certifi package and prints the path to the CA bundle. It contains no user input handling, no network operations, and no data manipulation beyond printing a static value. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply outputs the location of a CA bundle provided by certifi. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign utility script that relies on a standard package.",
