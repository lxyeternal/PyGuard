  "purpose": "This module provides the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from certifi, and the print statement that outputs its value.",
  "sinks": "The output of the script (the CA bundle path) could potentially be captured or redirected, but no malicious data flow is evident.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function's output flows directly to stdout via print().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only outputs a known function result without any unusual code constructs or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from certifi, then prints its value when executed directly. There are no user inputs, no network operations, and no data leaks or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a simple utility for retrieving the CA bundle path. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility script that outputs the default CA bundle path from certifi. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
