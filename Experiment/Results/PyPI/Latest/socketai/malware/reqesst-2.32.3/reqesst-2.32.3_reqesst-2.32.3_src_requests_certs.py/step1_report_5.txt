{
  "purpose": "Provides the default CA certificate bundle path using the certifi package, mainly for SSL/TLS verification.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the certifi package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the certificate path, potentially exposing the path if used in an insecure environment.",
  "flows": "The code calls 'where' from certifi (source) and outputs the result via 'print' (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and standard for obtaining CA bundle path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the 'certifi' library, which returns the path to the CA bundle used for SSL verification. It then prints this path if run as a main module. There are no malicious operations, data leaks, or suspicious code. The code serves a simple utility purpose with no external data inputs or insecure behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that outputs the default CA bundle path. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
