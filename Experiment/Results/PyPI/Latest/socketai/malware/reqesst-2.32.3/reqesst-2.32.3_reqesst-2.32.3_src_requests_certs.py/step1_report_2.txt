  "purpose": "To provide the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the certifi package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' source flows directly into the 'print()' sink, displaying the certificate bundle location.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward and relies on a standard library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package, which provides the path to the trusted CA certificates. When run as a script, it prints this path to the console. There are no hidden, obfuscated, or suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, and no network activity or data exfiltration. The code’s purpose is purely informational and consistent with its description. The comments indicate that it can be modified for packaging purposes, but no malicious intent or harmful behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and intended to reveal the CA bundle location. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It is a straightforward utility script with no suspicious features.",
