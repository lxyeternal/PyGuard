      "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The main concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which should be from a trusted source. The script contains no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The security risk is minimal and acceptable in a controlled environment."

The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1)."

      "conclusion": "This module is a benign, standard set of exception classes for the requests library. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening code. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly scored as 0. The slight risk score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified and should be lowered to 0, reflecting the code's harmless nature."

      "conclusion": "The embedded code demonstrates explicit malicious behavior—downloading and executing external payloads without validation—justifying a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1. The rest of the code is benign. The malicious snippet's presence indicates a severe security threat, consistent across all reports. The assigned scores are appropriate, and immediate action is recommended to mitigate this supply chain attack."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility module for cookie management within the requests ecosystem. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the low risk score accurately reflects its utility purpose. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is safe for use."

The minor bug in the copy() method does not impact security but should be corrected for proper functionality. All security and malware scores are 0, with a very low risk score (~0.1) justified by the minor bug, which is not security-critical."

The low security risk score is appropriate, assuming a trusted environment. Overall, the code is benign and serves a legacy support purpose."
