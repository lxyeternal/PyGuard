{
  "purpose": "Define a set of custom exception classes for handling various request-related errors and warnings in the requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and internal compat module; instantiation of exception classes; attribute access on response objects.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code primarily defines exception classes without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and attribute assignment do not involve untrusted data flow or external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions, with typical inheritance and no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward collection of exception classes used for error handling in the requests library. It imports standard exception classes and defines subclasses for specific error scenarios. The __init__ methods handle typical attribute assignment and inheritance. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are observed. The structure and logic align with typical exception handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious exception class definition module for request error handling. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected.",
