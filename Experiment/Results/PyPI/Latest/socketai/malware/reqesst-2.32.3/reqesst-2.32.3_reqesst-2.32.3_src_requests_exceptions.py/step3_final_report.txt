  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling errors in the requests library, including HTTP errors, connection issues, and warnings.",
  "sources": "Class initializations, attribute assignments, and inheritance from external exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; exception attributes may hold references but do not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and attribute setting; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks beyond standard exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions related to HTTP request handling, with proper inheritance and minimal logic. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The import statements and class structures are standard. The __reduce__ method in JSONDecodeError supports pickling but does not introduce security concerns. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard patterns indicate no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, standard set of exception classes for the requests library. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening code. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly scored as 0. The slight risk score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified and should be lowered to 0, reflecting the code's harmless nature.",
