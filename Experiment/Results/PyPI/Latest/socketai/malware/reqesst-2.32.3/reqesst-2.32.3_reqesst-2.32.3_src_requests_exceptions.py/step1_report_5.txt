  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors and warnings in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources; all data are internal exception handling and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code primarily defines exception classes without dynamic or reflective behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines a hierarchy of exception and warning classes for the Requests library, extending built-in exceptions and other exceptions from urllib3 and compat modules. The inheritance structure appears standard. There are no indications of malicious logic, data leaks, or backdoors. No code injection, unsafe evaluations, or network activities are present. The presence of __reduce__ for pickling is typical for exception classes, and no obfuscated or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign set of exception and warning class definitions for the Requests library. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The structure and content are consistent with typical library error handling modules.",
