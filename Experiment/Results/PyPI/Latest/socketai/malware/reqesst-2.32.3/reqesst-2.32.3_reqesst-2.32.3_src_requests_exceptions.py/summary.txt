  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, standard set of exception classes for the requests library. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening code. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly scored as 0. The slight risk score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified and should be lowered to 0, reflecting the code's harmless nature."
