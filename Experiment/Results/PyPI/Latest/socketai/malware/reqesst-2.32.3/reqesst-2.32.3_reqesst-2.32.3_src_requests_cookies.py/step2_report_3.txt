  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for any potential issues, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides cookie handling utilities, including classes `MockRequest`, `MockResponse`, and functions for extracting, setting, and removing cookies. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is utility-focused, with no signs of malicious behavior. The use of threading for thread safety is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard cookie creation, extraction, and management functions. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Analysis:** The functions perform expected cookie management tasks. No external network activity or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on cookie creation, extraction, merging, and management. No malicious intent detected.\n\n- **Analysis:** The code is standard for cookie handling, with no signs of sabotage or malicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the utility functions for cookie management, with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Analysis:** The code operates solely on cookies and headers, with no network or system modification.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 seem justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues with scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard cookie handling code, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Analysis:** The code is consistent with typical cookie management utilities, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, which is consistent with the code review. The code does not perform any network activity beyond cookie management, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected in any reports or code snippets.\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, the low risk scores (around 0.1 to 0.2) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain low, around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, well-implemented utility module for cookie management, with no malicious or suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores are appropriately conservative, reflecting the utility nature of the code.",
