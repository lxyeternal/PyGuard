  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security implications, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides cookie handling utilities, including classes `MockRequest`, `MockResponse`, and functions like `extract_cookies_to_jar`, `get_cookie_header`. It reads request URLs, headers, and response headers.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookies are extracted from response headers into a cookie jar, and headers are generated for requests.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code performs standard cookie management tasks. No external network activity or covert operations are evident.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a standard utility for cookie handling, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, security risk is low (0.1).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. The score of 0.0 malware and low risk are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions for cookies, including creation, extraction, and management, reading request/response headers, and cookie objects.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No credentials, suspicious URL/domain usage, or malicious patterns. Functions manipulate cookies based on input parameters without validation beyond basic type checks. No malicious behavior is detected.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is standard, benign, with high confidence (0.95). Malware score is 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The low malware and risk scores are justified. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Provides cookie management functions, including creating, extracting, merging, and manipulating cookies and cookie jars.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscation. The code is typical for cookie handling modules.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is legitimate, utility-oriented, with high confidence (0.95). Malware score is 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, handling cookies, request/response headers, and cookie jars.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no network activity, no obfuscation. The code is standard.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9). Malware score 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same theme—cookie utilities, including extraction, creation, and management.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or network activity. Functions perform expected cookie handling.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (0.95). Malware score 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code performs standard cookie management without any malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) reflects minimal security concern, which is reasonable given the code's utility nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, given the code's benign purpose.\n\n**Note:** The code is a standard utility module for cookie handling in the requests ecosystem, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or vulnerabilities beyond typical operational risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and their scoring accurately reflects the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
