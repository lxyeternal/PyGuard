  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reported issues, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides cookie compatibility utilities, with classes `MockRequest`, `MockResponse`, and functions for cookie extraction and management. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is a standard utility module for cookie handling, with no signs of malicious activity. The low risk score (0.1) seems appropriate, given the benign nature. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard cookie creation, extraction, and management functions. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code appears to be a typical cookie utility module. The slightly higher risk score (0.2) is still reasonable, considering the functions manipulate cookies but do not perform any harmful actions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard nature of the code, with functions for creating, extracting, and merging cookies. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe assessment aligns with the code's purpose. The risk score remains appropriate, and malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Continues to describe the code as standard cookie management utilities, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous reports; the low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing the benign, utility-oriented nature of the code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior?**  \n  No. The code is purely utility functions/classes for cookie management, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and readable.\n\n- **Risk score justification:**  \n  All reports assign low risk scores (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's purpose and lack of malicious features, these are reasonable. The only reason to consider slightly higher is if the code were used maliciously in context, but as standalone utility code, the risk remains minimal.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. No malicious intent or behavior is present.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  No. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with the benign utility nature)\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard utility code)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected or reasonably inferred from the code provided.",
