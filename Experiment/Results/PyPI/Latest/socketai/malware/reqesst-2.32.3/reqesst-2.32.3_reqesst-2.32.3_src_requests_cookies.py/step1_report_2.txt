  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies in the requests library, including cookie extraction, management, and conversion between different cookie representations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from request URL, headers, and cookie data (e.g., in 'extract_cookies_to_jar', 'create_cookie', 'morsel_to_cookie', 'cookiejar_from_dict').",
  "sinks": "Creates or modifies cookies, potentially setting cookie headers, or clearing cookies (e.g., 'set', 'remove_cookie_by_name', 'set_cookie', 'create_cookie').",
  "flows": "Input URL/headers/cookie data → cookie creation or modification → storage in CookieJar → cookie extraction or header generation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious URL/domain usage. The code's purpose is standard cookie handling; however, functions like 'set', 'remove_cookie_by_name' and 'create_cookie' manipulate cookies based on input parameters without validation beyond basic type checks. No malicious backdoors or hidden behaviors are evident. The code uses threading locks, but this is normal for thread safety.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie management functions: creating cookies, converting Morsel objects to cookies, extracting cookies into a jar, generating cookie headers, and removing cookies by name. The 'MockRequest' and 'MockResponse' classes are wrappers for internal use to simulate request and response objects, facilitating cookie handling. No input data is fetched from untrusted sources other than request URLs and headers, which are expected. No code injection, data leakage, or hidden network activity is present. The code's structure is typical for cookie handling, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious modifications. The code does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications. Overall, the code is a legitimate, standard utility for cookie handling with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code's purpose is benign, aimed at handling cookies in HTTP requests and responses. No indicators of malicious intent or malware are present.",
