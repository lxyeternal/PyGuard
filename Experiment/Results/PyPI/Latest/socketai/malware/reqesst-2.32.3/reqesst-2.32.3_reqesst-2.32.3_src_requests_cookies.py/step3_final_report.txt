  "purpose": "Utility classes and functions for managing cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, creation, and header management.",
  "sources": "Request URL, request headers, response headers, cookie objects, request parameters",
  "sinks": "Request headers (Cookie), response headers (Set-Cookie), cookie jar storage",
  "flows": "Request URL and headers are read to produce cookie headers; response headers are parsed to extract cookies into the jar; cookies are created, merged, or removed based on function calls",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network activity, no suspicious URL or domain usage, no backdoors or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard cookie management utilities, including classes for request/response wrapping, cookie extraction, creation, merging, and removal. It operates solely on cookie data, with no network or system modification. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and align with typical cookie handling practices. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, utility-oriented nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility module for cookie management within the requests ecosystem. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the low risk score accurately reflects its utility purpose. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is safe for use.",
