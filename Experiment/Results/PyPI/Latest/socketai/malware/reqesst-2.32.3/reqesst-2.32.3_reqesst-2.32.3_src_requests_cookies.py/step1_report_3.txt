  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for managing cookies in requests, including creating, extracting, merging, and manipulating cookies and cookie jars.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.internal_utils, .compat), reading request headers, reading response headers, cookie creation functions, and cookie jar operations.",
  "sinks": "Cookie header setting, cookie extraction into jar, cookie retrieval by name, manipulation of cookie attributes, serialization (pickling) and copying of cookie jars.",
  "flows": "Input request headers -> extraction functions; response headers -> cookie extraction; cookie jar operations -> setting, getting, merging cookies; cookie creation functions -> adding cookies to jar.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious network calls or external data exfiltration, no obfuscated or intentionally malicious code. Functions are standard utility implementations. The code contains comprehensive cookie handling logic, which is typical for cookie management modules.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard, well-structured cookie management functionalities: wrapping requests and responses for cookie processing, creating cookies with given parameters, converting Morsel objects to cookies, managing cookies within a CookieJar with dict-like interface, and functions for extracting and merging cookies. No signs of malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft are present. The code does not perform any unsolicited network activity or system modifications. It relies on standard library modules and includes no external suspicious calls. The code appears to be purely utility-oriented for cookie management, consistent with a typical open-source package for requests.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, utility-focused implementation for cookie handling within the requests library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It offers cookie creation, extraction, merging, and management functions typical for a cookie handling module. No security risks or malware indicators are identified.",
