  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup script for packaging; no issues.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Uses sys.argv, os.system, exec() for version info.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of exec() on version file can be risky if the file is malicious.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just standard packaging code. exec() is common but should be trusted.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or security risks detected; primarily a typical setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate; no issues found. The use of exec() is standard but should be trusted.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar setup script for 'requests' library.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Uses sys.argv, os.system, exec() for version info.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; exec() is standard for reading version info.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; standard package setup.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; the script is typical, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Package setup, similar to above.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Uses sys.argv, os.system, exec() for version info.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of exec() could be risky if the version file is compromised.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent; standard setup pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware, but the exec() usage warrants caution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — reasonable given the exec() concern.\n\n**Assessment:** The elevated securityRisk score is justified due to exec() usage, but no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar setup script.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Uses sys.argv, os.system, exec().\n- **Anomalies:** Same concern with exec(); no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Standard setup; exec() should be trusted.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware; only the exec() concern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no malware, just cautious about exec().\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup script.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Uses sys.argv, os.system, exec().\n- **Anomalies:** exec() on version info; no malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Typical setup pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; safe in context.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.2) due to the use of exec() to load version info, which is a known pattern but could be risky if the version file is compromised.\n\n### **Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk (due to exec()):** While exec() can be risky if the version file is malicious, in a trusted environment, this is standard practice. The scores of 0.1-0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — considering the exec() usage, but overall low risk in a controlled environment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent. The use of exec() to load version info is common but should be handled with trusted files. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis. No further action or concern is necessary beyond standard best practices (e.g., ensuring version files are secure).",
