  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The main concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which should be from a trusted source. The script contains no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The security risk is minimal and acceptable in a controlled environment."
