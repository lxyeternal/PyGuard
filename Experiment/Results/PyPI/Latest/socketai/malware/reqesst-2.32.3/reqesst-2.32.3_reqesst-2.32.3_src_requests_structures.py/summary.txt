  "conclusion": "The code is benign, safe, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor bug in the copy() method does not impact security but should be corrected for proper functionality. All security and malware scores are 0, with a very low risk score (~0.1) justified by the minor bug, which is not security-critical."
