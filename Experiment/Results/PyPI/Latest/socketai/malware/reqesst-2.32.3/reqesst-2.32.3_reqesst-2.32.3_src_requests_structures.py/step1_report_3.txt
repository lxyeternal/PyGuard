{
  "purpose": "Provide data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used in HTTP request handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from initialization parameters (data, kwargs, name), and accesses internal dictionaries (__dict__, self._store).",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sinks are evident; no network, file, or environment variable access occurs.",
  "flows": "Data is input during object construction and stored internally; no flow to external systems or outputs is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic, are present. Implementation is straightforward, consistent with typical data structure code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries. It handles keys by normalizing to lowercase for lookups but preserves original case for display and iteration. The internal logic is clear, with no signs of malicious behavior. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be part of a request handling library, with no malicious intent or sabotage observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and functional, designed to support HTTP header and lookup operations without malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware detected.",
