{
  "purpose": "Provides data structures for handling HTTP headers and key-value mappings in the Requests library, including case-insensitive dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Input data during initialization of CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict (e.g., data parameter, kwargs).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent over the network, written to files, or used in potentially dangerous system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into internal storage (_store and __dict__), but no untrusted data is used in sensitive operations or external system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code strictly implements standard data structures with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict, which are straightforward data structures for dictionary-like behavior. No code injection, external data processing, or network operations are present. The code utilizes standard Python collections and simple methods to manage data. The functions do not process untrusted input in a manner that could lead to vulnerabilities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used within the Requests library. It contains no malicious code, security risks, or obfuscated logic. The code appears safe and purpose-specific, with no indications of malicious intent.",
