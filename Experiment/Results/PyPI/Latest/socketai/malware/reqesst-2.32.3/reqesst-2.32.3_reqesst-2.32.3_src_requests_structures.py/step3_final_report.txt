{
  "purpose": "Provides data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used internally within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in __init__ methods, data assigned in __setitem__, data retrieved in __getitem__, get, and iteration methods.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; internal data is stored in memory without external interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into internal _store or __dict__, with access via __getitem__, __setitem__, and iteration methods; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "The copy() method in CaseInsensitiveDict returns self._store.values() instead of a proper copy, which is a functional bug but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, well-understood data structures with no suspicious or malicious code. The only notable issue is the flawed copy() method, which does not pose security risks but could cause functional bugs. No obfuscation, external interactions, or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and purpose-specific.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, safe, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor bug in the copy() method does not impact security but should be corrected for proper functionality. All security and malware scores are 0, with a very low risk score (~0.1) justified by the minor bug, which is not security-critical.",
