{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility functions and imports for handling different Python versions and libraries, mainly for HTTP and charset detection.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module (for dynamic library import), sys.version_info (Python version), urllib3.__version__ (library version), and standard library modules (json, collections, http, io, urllib).",
  "sinks": "None of the imported functions or variables are used as sinks for untrusted data; they serve static purposes or compatibility.",
  "flows": "The code dynamically imports libraries based on availability and Python version, but does not process or handle untrusted input data.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic imports for optional libraries (chardet, simplejson), which is common but not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up compatibility imports and detects library versions and available modules for Python 2 and 3 environments. It dynamically imports optional libraries like chardet and simplejson if available, but does not execute any untrusted code or data. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or malicious side-effects are identified. The code is straightforward and standard for compatibility layers, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a compatibility layer for different Python versions and optional libraries. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is safe and typical for such utility modules.",
