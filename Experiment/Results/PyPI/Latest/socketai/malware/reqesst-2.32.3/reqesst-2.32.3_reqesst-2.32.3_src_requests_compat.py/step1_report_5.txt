{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as managing dependencies such as urllib3, chardet, and simplejson.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (importlib, sys, urllib3, simplejson/json, collections, http, io, urllib). Dynamic module import attempts for chardet/charset_normalizer.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks, such as network operations, file writes, or execution of untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "Imports and dynamic module resolution flow from source to usage, but no untrusted data sources are processed or propagated to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs dynamic imports and version detection, but there are no suspicious or unusual code behaviors such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or hardcoded secrets. The use of dynamic import for chardet/charset_normalizer is typical for compatibility modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility shim that manages imports and Python version differences. It includes version detection for urllib3, attempts to import optional modules like simplejson and chardet, and defines some Python version-specific flags. All imports and functions are standard for compatibility purposes, with no evidence of malicious activity or malicious code constructs. The dynamic import logic and conditional module loading are typical and safe. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard compatibility and utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical import resolution and version handling for a Python package.",
