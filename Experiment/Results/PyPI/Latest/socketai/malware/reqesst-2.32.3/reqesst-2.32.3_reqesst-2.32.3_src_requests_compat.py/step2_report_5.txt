  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, handling imports, version detection, and optional dependencies.\n- All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code uses well-understood patterns: try-except for optional modules, version checks, static imports.\n- No untrusted data sources, network activity, or code injection points are present.\n- The dynamic imports are controlled and based on fixed module names, not user input.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are evident; the code performs as intended for compatibility.\n- **Scores given:**\n  - *Malware:* 0 in all reports — appropriate.\n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — correct, no obfuscation.\n  - *SecurityRisk:* Ranges from 0.1 to 0 — reasonable, given the code's nature.\n- **Flow and reasoning:** The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no suspicious logic.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The only potential concern could be the dynamic import of 'chardet' and 'charset_normalizer', but this is a common pattern for optional dependencies, not malicious.\n- Version detection and import logic are standard and safe.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; all operations are static and controlled.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores for malware and obfuscated code are accurate and should remain at 0.\n- The small security risk score (around 0.1) is acceptable, reflecting minimal concern due to dynamic imports, but it's not a real risk.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 0.95), matching the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, due to dynamic imports, but not problematic.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is a benign compatibility utility with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- Scores are appropriate and should not be changed.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the code's benign nature and standard compatibility purpose.",
