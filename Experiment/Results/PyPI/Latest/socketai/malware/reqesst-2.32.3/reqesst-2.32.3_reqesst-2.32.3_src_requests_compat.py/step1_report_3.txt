{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling import differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as importing various libraries and modules needed for HTTP requests and data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads module imports, version info from sys, and external library detection (_resolve_char_detection).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are present; the code primarily sets up environment and library compatibility.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules, detecting library versions, dynamically importing optional modules (e.g., chardet, simplejson), and defining compatibility variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The dynamic import of 'chardet' and 'simplejson' is standard for compatibility; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility utility module that imports standard libraries, detects versions, and dynamically loads optional modules to support older environments. It uses try-except blocks appropriately to handle import failures without executing untrusted code. No indications of obfuscated, malicious, or maliciously behaving code are found. All import behaviors are typical for compatibility layers in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly handles optional dependencies and maintains compatibility across Python versions without performing any unsafe or suspicious operations.",
