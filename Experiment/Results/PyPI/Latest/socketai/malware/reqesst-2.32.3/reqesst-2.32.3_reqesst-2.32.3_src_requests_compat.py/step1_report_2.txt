  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility and utility functions for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as importing necessary modules for HTTP requests and character detection.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module for 'chardet' and 'charset_normalizer'; import statements for standard libraries such as sys, urllib3, simplejson/json, collections, http, io, urllib, and http.cookies",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; all imports are from trusted standard or third-party libraries for compatibility purposes",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; module imports and variable assignments are static and controlled",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward compatibility checks and module imports, handling version detection and optional dependencies such as 'simplejson' and character detection libraries. It includes version checks and conditional imports, which are standard practices. No code execution based on untrusted input or network activity is present. The code does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues; it is a compatibility utility module.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign compatibility and utility library with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
