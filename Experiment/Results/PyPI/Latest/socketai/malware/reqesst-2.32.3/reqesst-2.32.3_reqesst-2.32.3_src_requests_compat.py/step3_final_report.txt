{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3, handling import differences and version detection for the urllib3 library and related modules.",
  "sources": "Version string from urllib3, import attempts for optional modules (chardet, simplejson), sys.version_info, fixed module names for standard libraries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static imports and version checks only.",
  "flows": "Version detection flows through string splitting and integer conversion; optional module imports based on fixed module names; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward compatibility code with standard patterns; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility layer that detects Python version, urllib3 version, and dynamically imports optional modules like chardet and simplejson. It performs version checks and static imports without processing untrusted data or executing dynamic code based on user input. The import logic is safe, and no network activity or data exfiltration is present. The code uses standard practices for backward compatibility, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minimal risk score reflects the controlled dynamic imports, but overall, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign compatibility utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.05 to 0.1, with 0.05 being more precise. The confidence in this assessment is high.",
