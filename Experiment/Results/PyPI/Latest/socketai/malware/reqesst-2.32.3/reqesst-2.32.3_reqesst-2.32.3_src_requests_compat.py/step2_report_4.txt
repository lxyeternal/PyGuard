  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is a standard compatibility utility with no malicious intent, supported by the fact that it only performs version detection and imports from trusted modules.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Evaluation:** The low risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature. The malware score is correctly zero; no malicious activity is evident. The overall reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the benign nature of the code, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Evaluation:** The zero risk and malware scores are justified. The reasoning aligns with the code's straightforward purpose.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is characterized as a compatibility setup with no malicious activity, handling optional dependencies safely.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Evaluation:** The assessment is consistent; no issues found.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is described as a compatibility layer with no malicious behavior, with dynamic imports being standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning is consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, noting the standard nature of the code, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Evaluation:** Appropriate scores and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is purely a compatibility layer, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- Given the code's straightforward purpose and lack of suspicious behavior, I agree with the provided scores.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0, but a minimal non-zero risk is acceptable for compatibility code, though 0 is also justified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe compatibility utility with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The current scoring and reasoning are appropriate.",
