{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and manages version detection and library imports for dependencies like urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, and other standard libraries.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version checks, and function calls such as importlib.import_module, sys.version_info, and various urllib.parse and urllib.request functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable functions include importlib.import_module, which loads external modules, and the use of version strings and dynamic imports. No data is sent externally or written to files. No user input or environment variables are directly used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Importlib.import_module and version parsing are sources that could load malicious modules if they were injected into the environment, but the list of module names is fixed and not influenced by untrusted input. The version detection and import logic are straightforward and do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code performs standard compatibility imports and version checks without any hidden or obfuscated behavior. The try-except blocks are standard for fallback logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles import compatibility and version detection. It uses importlib to conditionally import modules, performs version checks via sys.version_info, and manages compatibility for json/simplejson. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All imported modules and functions are standard, and there are no hardcoded credentials or sensitive data handling. The code appears to be a compatibility utility with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on fixed library names and standard library functions, with no external input influencing its logic. Overall, it appears safe.",
