  "conclusion": "The embedded code demonstrates explicit malicious behavior—downloading and executing external payloads without validation—justifying a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1. The rest of the code is benign. The malicious snippet's presence indicates a severe security threat, consistent across all reports. The assigned scores are appropriate, and immediate action is recommended to mitigate this supply chain attack."
