  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Dependency and environment setup for Requests.\n- **Sources:** Reads version info from imported modules.\n- **Sinks:** No direct data sinks; mainly warnings/assertions.\n- **Flows:** Version checks, warnings, environment modifications.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses assertions for version validation; standard fallback for SSL.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard dependency management.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- Risk: Low (dependency checks and fallback are common and safe)  \n- Confidence: 0.9 (high certainty about benign intent)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing dependency validation, SSL fallback, and environment configuration.  \n- No suspicious code or malicious behavior.  \n- Standard practices for environment setup.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: Slightly higher but still low (~0.2) due to reliance on assertions and environment modifications, which are standard.  \n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- Focuses on dependency validation, SSL fallback, and warnings.  \n- No untrusted data handling or suspicious logic.  \n- Standard setup code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (consistent with dependency setup)  \n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar dependency and environment checks, no malicious activity.  \n- No external data processing or code injection.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2  \n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- Again, dependency validation, SSL configuration, warnings.  \n- No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (standard setup)  \n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate standard dependency management, version checks, and environment configuration. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Clear, well-structured code with no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk Score:** The highest risk is from assertions that could cause crashes if dependencies are incompatible, but this is a common practice for internal validation, not malicious.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to reliance on assertions and environment modifications, but these are standard practices.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard dependency validation and environment setup module for the Requests library. It performs version checks, SSL fallback, and warning configurations, all of which are typical and safe. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware score at 0.  \n- Obfuscated remains at 0.  \n- Risk score can be around 0.2, reflecting minor concerns about assertions but overall safe.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more conservative or aggressive scoring approach.",
