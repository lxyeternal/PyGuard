  "sinks": "Warnings, assertions, environment modifications, and logging.",
  "flows": "Version parsing and validation → warnings/assertions → environment adjustments and fallback imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for version validation which could cause crashes if dependencies are incompatible; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency checks, version assertions, SSL fallback setup, and warning configurations. It does not handle untrusted data, connect to external domains, or execute suspicious logic. Assertions serve as internal validation and are common in such setup scripts. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a routine dependency and environment validation module for the Requests library. It is clear, well-structured, and safe. The absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity indicates a benign purpose.",
