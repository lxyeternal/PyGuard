  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'littelbitx0' intended for pentesting.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools module, find_packages() function call",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data output",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; setup parameters are static and predefined",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools to define package metadata and structure. The package name, version, description, author, and package discovery are statically assigned with no dynamic or malicious code. The description indicates use for pentesting, but this is purely descriptive. No input handling, external data, or potential attack vectors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a benign package configuration with no suspicious or malicious intent.",
