  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'littelbitx0', intended for pentesting.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines static package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed; author name is 'non', which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata, including name, version, description, author, and package discovery. No dynamic code execution, no obfuscated parts, and no suspicious activities are present. It appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard package configuration with no embedded threats.",
