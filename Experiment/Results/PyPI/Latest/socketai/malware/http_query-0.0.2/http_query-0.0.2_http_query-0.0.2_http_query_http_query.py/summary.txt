  "conclusion": "The code performs credential exfiltration by reading AWS secrets and sending them to an external webhook without safeguards, constituting malicious behavior with high security risk. The assigned malware and risk scores are appropriate, with a slight emphasis on the severity of secret theft. This pattern should be flagged as a serious security concern due to potential credential compromise."
