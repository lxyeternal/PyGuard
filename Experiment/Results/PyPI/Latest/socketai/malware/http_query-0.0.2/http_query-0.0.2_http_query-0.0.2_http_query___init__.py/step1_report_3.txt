  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but without seeing the actual code, the exact intent cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, function parameters, or file reads. Since the code is not provided, specific sources cannot be identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamic code. Without the code, exact sinks cannot be pinpointed.",
  "flows": "Data flow would typically be from input sources to sinks through various processing steps; specifics cannot be determined without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without inspecting the actual code. Look for hardcoded secrets, unusual imports, or obfuscated segments if code were provided.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information to analyze specific source-to-sink flows, anomalies, or security issues. A detailed review of the code content is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "Cannot conclusively determine malicious behavior or security risks without examining the actual code. No suspicious patterns are observable from the current input.",
