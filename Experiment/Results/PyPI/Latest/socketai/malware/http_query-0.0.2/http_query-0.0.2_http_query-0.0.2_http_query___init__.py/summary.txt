  "conclusion": "The code appears mostly benign with no definitive malicious behavior. Suspicion arises mainly from obfuscation and dynamic features, but without concrete evidence, the malware score should be conservative. Minor adjustments to security risk scores can improve accuracy. The reports are generally consistent and well-reasoned."
