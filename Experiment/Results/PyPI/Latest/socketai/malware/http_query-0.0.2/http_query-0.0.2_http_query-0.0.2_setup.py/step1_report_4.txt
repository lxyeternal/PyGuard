  "purpose": "Configure and distribute a Python package named 'http_query' with specified dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "setuptools.setup() function parameters, including author, description, entry_points, and install_requires",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of entry point 'http_query' which runs 'http_query.http_query:main'",
  "flows": "Code reads package metadata from parameters, and if installed/executed, invokes the 'main' function from 'http_query.http_query' module",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code present; description explicitly states 'Dont install this package, purely testing purpose'. No hidden code, no obfuscated logic, or suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, utilizing setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. The description explicitly states that the package should not be installed and is for testing purposes only, indicating no malicious intent. No sources or sinks suggest malicious data handling or behavior. The entry point could execute arbitrary code if malicious, but given the context and description, this appears benign. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for a testing package with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. The explicit description suggests no malicious intent.",
