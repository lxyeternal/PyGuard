{
  "purpose": "Setuptools setup configuration for the Python package 'http_query'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata (name, version, author, description), dependencies (click, requests), and the entry point for the console script.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'http_query' console script which calls 'http_query.http_query:main', potential for executing untrusted code if the main function is malicious.",
  "flows": "The package installation reads metadata and dependencies, and the 'http_query' command executes the main function in 'http_query.http_query'.",
  "anomalies": "The description explicitly states 'Dont install this package, purely testing purpose', which is unusual for a production package. The setup code itself appears standard and does not contain hidden or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package details, dependencies, and entry points. No code is executed beyond defining package metadata. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The mention of 'testing purpose' suggests the package is intended for testing only and does not perform any malicious actions. The entry point calls a main function that is not provided here, so its behavior cannot be assessed, but based solely on this setup script, there is no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is straightforward and does not contain any malicious or suspicious code. The package appears to be a testing artifact with no malicious behavior or security risks based on this code snippet.",
