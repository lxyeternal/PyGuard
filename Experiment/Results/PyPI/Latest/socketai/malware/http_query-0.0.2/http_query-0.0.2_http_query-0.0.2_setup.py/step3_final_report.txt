  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'http_query' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields, dependencies ('click', 'requests'), entry point 'http_query.http_query:main'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main' function in 'http_query.http_query' module, which could perform arbitrary actions when CLI is invoked.",
  "flows": "User runs 'http_query' CLI command -> invokes 'http_query.http_query:main' -> potential execution of malicious or benign code depending on implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Explicit warning in description: 'Dont install this package, purely testing purpose'—indicates testing or experimental intent; no obfuscation or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with package metadata, dependencies, and an entry point. No malicious or suspicious code is embedded. The warning suggests testing use, not malicious intent. The actual behavior depends on the implementation of 'main', which is not provided. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of this setup code. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The risk is minimal, primarily due to the potential execution of arbitrary code in 'main', but this cannot be confirmed here.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script appears benign and correctly scored. The explicit warning and lack of suspicious code suggest low risk. The actual malicious potential hinges on the 'main' function's implementation, which is not available. Overall, the code is safe based on this snippet, with no malware detected.",
