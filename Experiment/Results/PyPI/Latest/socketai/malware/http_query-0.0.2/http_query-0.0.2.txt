      "conclusion": "The setup script appears benign and correctly scored. The explicit warning and lack of suspicious code suggest low risk. The actual malicious potential hinges on the 'main' function's implementation, which is not available. Overall, the code is safe based on this snippet, with no malware detected."

      "conclusion": "The code appears mostly benign with no definitive malicious behavior. Suspicion arises mainly from obfuscation and dynamic features, but without concrete evidence, the malware score should be conservative. Minor adjustments to security risk scores can improve accuracy. The reports are generally consistent and well-reasoned."

      "conclusion": "The code performs credential exfiltration by reading AWS secrets and sending them to an external webhook without safeguards, constituting malicious behavior with high security risk. The assigned malware and risk scores are appropriate, with a slight emphasis on the severity of secret theft. This pattern should be flagged as a serious security concern due to potential credential compromise."
