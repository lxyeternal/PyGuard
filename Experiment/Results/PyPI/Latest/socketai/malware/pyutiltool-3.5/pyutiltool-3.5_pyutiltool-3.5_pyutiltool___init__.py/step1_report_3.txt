  "purpose": "Decode and decompress an obfuscated payload, then execute it.",
  "sources": "Input data is the base64-encoded, reversed, and compressed byte string passed to the lambda function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decompressed code via exec() on the output of the lambda function.",
  "flows": "The code takes the obfuscated data, reverses it, base64-decodes, decompresses, then executes it.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code with layered encoding and compression; uses dynamic import and execution; no explicit input validation or sandboxing; the payload is embedded as a large, complex base64 string.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that imports zlib and base64, reverses the obfuscated string, decodes it from base64, decompresses it, and then executes the resulting code. The payload is a large, seemingly random byte sequence that is processed at runtime, indicating intent to hide malicious behavior. The use of exec() on decompressed code suggests that the actual malicious payload is hidden and only revealed upon execution. This pattern is typical of obfuscated malicious scripts designed to evade detection. The code does not perform any validation or checks on the decompressed content, and the complex layering (reversal, base64, decompression) indicates an attempt to conceal intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated loader that decodes, decompresses, and executes hidden payloads. The use of dynamic import, decoding, decompression, and immediate execution strongly suggests malicious intent, likely to run malicious payloads hidden within the encoded string. Due to the obfuscation and execution pattern, this code should be considered malicious and unsafe for use.",
