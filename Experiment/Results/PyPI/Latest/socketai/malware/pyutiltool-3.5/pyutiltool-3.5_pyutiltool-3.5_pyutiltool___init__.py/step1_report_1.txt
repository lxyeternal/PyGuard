  "purpose": "Decode and execute obfuscated data, likely for dynamic code execution.",
  "sources": "Base64 string reversed in the lambda function; the string is then decoded and decompressed.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executes the decompressed code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "The code takes an obfuscated base64 string, reverses it, decodes from base64, decompresses with zlib, then executes the resulting code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a lambda function to reverse and decode an embedded string; large obfuscated payload; immediate execution of dynamically decompressed code; the payload is heavily obfuscated, indicating intent to hide behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that reverses a string, base64 decodes it, and decompresses it with zlib. It then executes the resulting code with exec(). The payload appears to be a large, obfuscated data blob, which is typical of malicious or concealed code. The immediate execution of decompressed data without any validation or restrictions indicates potential malicious intent. The obfuscation, combined with the use of exec() on dynamically decoded data, strongly suggests malicious or harmful behavior designed to hide its true purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to heavy obfuscation, dynamic execution, and lack of transparency about the payload. It likely performs malicious activities, such as executing hidden code, which could include data theft, system compromise, or other harmful actions. The overall security risk is high.",
