  "purpose": "Decodes and decompresses base64-encoded, reversed, zlib-compressed data, then executes the resulting code.",
  "sources": "Input data is the hardcoded base64 string in the lambda function, which is reversed and decoded.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decompressed code, which could run any arbitrary code with full privileges.",
  "flows": "Data is base64-decoded and reversed, then decompressed, and finally executed directly via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Code is heavily obfuscated with reversing, base64 encoding, zlib compression, and dynamic execution. No comments or documentation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that imports zlib and base64 modules to decode, reverse, and decompress a long base64 string. This string is then executed as Python code via exec(). The obfuscation techniques strongly suggest an intent to hide malicious payloads or unwanted behavior. The final payload could perform any malicious activity once decompressed and executed, such as system manipulation, data exfiltration, or other malicious operations. No visible source or external data is used beyond the embedded string, and the complexity indicates an attempt to evade detection. Without executing or analyzing the decompressed payload, certainty is limited, but the obfuscation alone is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and uses dynamic execution of decompressed data, which is characteristic of malicious payloads. While it is not definitively malicious without analyzing the decompressed code, the techniques used are commonly associated with malware. Caution is advised, and the package should not be used until further analysis is performed on the decompressed content.",
