  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging a Python module using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields such as name, version, description, author, author_email, and dependencies specified in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static configuration with no external input or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "None; all data is hardcoded and static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup.py script importing only setuptools and calling setup() with hardcoded metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code, user input, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The email appears to be a placeholder but does not indicate malicious intent. The code's simplicity and static nature suggest no malicious or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe for use.",
