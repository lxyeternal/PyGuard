  "purpose": "This setup.py script is used to package and distribute the Python module 'pyutiltool', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and the install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script primarily configures package setup without executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow or untrusted data passing from sources to sinks; the script simply supplies static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and standard; no unusual patterns, hidden code, or obfuscated parts are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports only standard setuptools functions and defines package metadata and requirements. There are no signs of dynamic execution, code injection, or malicious behavior. All dependencies and metadata are explicitly declared. The email address appears to be a test or placeholder, but this is not inherently malicious. No suspicious code flows or anomalies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script appears legitimate, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious code. There are no indicators of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
