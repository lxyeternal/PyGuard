  "sources": "Static code analysis of the setup.py file; no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data; the script only sets up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools methods to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It does not execute any dynamic code, process external inputs, or contain any suspicious behaviors. The only notable data is static package info and dependencies, which are common in setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py file appears to be a standard package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It contains typical setup parameters and dependencies, with no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks.",
