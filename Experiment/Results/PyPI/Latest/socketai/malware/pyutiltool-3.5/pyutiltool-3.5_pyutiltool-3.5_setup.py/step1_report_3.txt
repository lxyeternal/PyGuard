  "purpose": "Defines package metadata and dependencies for the Python package 'pyutiltool'.",
  "sources": "The setup.py file itself, primarily reading static data for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py script is a standard package configuration file using setuptools. It specifies package name, version, description, author info, dependencies, classifiers, and Python version requirements. All data appears to be static and hardcoded. There are no input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no credential handling or secret management. The code follows typical package setup conventions and does not include any suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
