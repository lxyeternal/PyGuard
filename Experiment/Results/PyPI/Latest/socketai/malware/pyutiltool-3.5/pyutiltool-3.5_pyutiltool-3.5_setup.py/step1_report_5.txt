{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the installation parameters for the 'pyutiltool' Python package.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters and the imported modules (setuptools).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code primarily defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only sets static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with static metadata such as package name, version, description, author info, and dependencies. There are no user inputs, environmental variable reads, or network operations. The install_requires list includes only the 'requests' library, which is standard and non-malicious. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and typical of a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script appears to be a normal package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
