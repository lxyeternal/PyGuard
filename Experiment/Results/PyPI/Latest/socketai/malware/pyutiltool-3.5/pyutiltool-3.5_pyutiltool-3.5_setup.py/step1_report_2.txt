  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'pyutiltool', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "User input: package metadata and dependencies specified in setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script is static configuration code without data flow execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers in a typical setup configuration. No suspicious or malicious patterns, code injections, or obfuscations are present. The install_requires includes only the 'requests' library, which is common and benign. The script is straightforward and standard for Python package setup. No anomalous or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and legitimate.",
