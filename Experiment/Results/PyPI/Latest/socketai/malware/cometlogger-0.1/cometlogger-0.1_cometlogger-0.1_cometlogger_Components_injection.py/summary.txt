  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to inject remote code into Discord, terminate processes, and restart the application with potentially malicious payloads. It exhibits behaviors characteristic of supply chain malware or backdoor trojans. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9-1, security risk ~0.85-1, obfuscated 0) are justified and should remain high. The code's intent and actions warrant high severity classification."
