  "conclusion": "The script is a malicious payload builder designed to embed webhooks into various payloads, obfuscate them via external tools, and facilitate remote control or exfiltration activities. Its structure, repeated obfuscation calls, and lack of input validation indicate malicious or highly suspicious intent. The high malware and security risk scores assigned by the reports are justified given its potential use in malware deployment or payload obfuscation."
