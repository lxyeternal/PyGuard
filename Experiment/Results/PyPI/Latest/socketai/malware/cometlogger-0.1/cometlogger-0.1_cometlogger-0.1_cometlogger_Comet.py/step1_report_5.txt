{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to steal various user data including credentials, tokens, browser histories, cookies, system info, files, and session data from multiple applications and browsers, and then exfiltrate this data via webhook or file upload services. Additionally, it attempts to disable or manipulate system processes and startup mechanisms to maintain persistence, inject into Discord clients, and evade detection.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, local files (browser databases, system info, files in user directories), network responses (API calls to services like ip-api.com, Instagram, TikTok, etc.), and process listings.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve sending data to external webhooks and upload services (Gofile, Discord webhook), writing data to files and archives, killing system processes, modifying system registry and startup entries, and injecting code into Discord clients.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (browser SQLite databases, system commands, environment variables, network API responses) to sinks (webhook posts, file writes, process termination, registry modifications, injections). For example, browser cookies and credentials are read and then sent via webhook or saved in local files; system info is collected and then transmitted; tokens are validated and exfiltrated; files are copied and uploaded.",
  "anomalies": "The code exhibits several suspicious behaviors: hardcoded webhook URLs, use of obfuscated PowerShell encoded commands, disabling or killing system processes (e.g., Discord), creating persistence via scheduled tasks or registry, injecting malicious scripts into Discord updates, and stealing sensitive data from browsers and applications. Additionally, fake error messages and anti-VM detection are present. The code structure is obfuscated with dynamic code execution and encoded commands, indicating potential obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a comprehensive info stealer and persistence mechanism. It enumerates browsers and applications, extracts stored credentials, cookies, tokens, and history from browsers and messaging apps, and exfiltrates this data via webhooks and file uploads. It also includes methods to disable or kill security-related processes, inject malicious code into Discord, and ensure startup persistence through registry, scheduled tasks, or startup folders. Anti-debug and anti-VM checks aim to evade analysis. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, obfuscated PowerShell commands, and extensive data collection from user systems strongly indicate malicious intent, specifically targeted data theft and system sabotage. The code is highly suspicious, with behaviors aligning with typical malware, including stealth, persistence, and data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, functioning as a full-fledged data-stealing malware targeting browsers, messaging apps, and system information. It employs obfuscation, persistence, process manipulation, and external communication to covertly collect and transmit sensitive user data. It exhibits typical traits of malware with high danger levels, including data exfiltration, process termination, system modification, and injection techniques.",
