  "purpose": "This code imports the 'hello' function or object from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which loads code from the 'main' module within the same package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not perform any data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows; the code only imports a component from a local module without executing or passing data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import of 'hello' from a local module named 'main'. It contains no logic, no data handling, and no external communication. There are no suspicious patterns, hidden behaviors, or malicious constructs. The minimal nature makes it unlikely to harbor malicious intent by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves to import a component from a local module. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
