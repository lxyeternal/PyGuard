  "purpose": "Simple relative import of 'hello' from the local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a static import with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement: 'from .main import hello'. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity. Confidence levels are mostly 1, reflecting certainty about benign nature, except for report 4 which is appropriately cautious at 0.5 due to limited context. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any external communication, data leakage, or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, standard import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary; the overall security assessment is that this code is safe.",
