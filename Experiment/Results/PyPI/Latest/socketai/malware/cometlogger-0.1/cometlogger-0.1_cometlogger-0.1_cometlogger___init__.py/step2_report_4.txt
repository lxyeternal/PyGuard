  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a simple import statement: `from .main import hello`.\n- No additional logic, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n- The code appears benign, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), except for report 4, which is 0.5.\n- Malware scores are uniformly 0, which aligns with the benign description.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, which is consistent given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is just an import statement, with no observable issues or malicious activity.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are present in the reports.\n- The reasoning is consistent: minimal code, no malicious indicators, and standard import usage.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- The **malware score** is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The **security risk score** is 0, also appropriate.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n\n### Specific notes on report 4:\n- It has a confidence of 0.5, which is lower than others. This might be due to the lack of context, but given the code's simplicity, even this uncertainty seems unwarranted.\n- I would recommend raising the confidence to 1 for consistency, as the code's benign nature is clear.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. No changes are necessary for the scores or conclusions. The minimal import statement is standard and poses no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the context, the code snippet is a benign import statement with no security issues. The reports are consistent and accurate, with the minor exception of report 4's confidence level, which I would adjust to 1.",
