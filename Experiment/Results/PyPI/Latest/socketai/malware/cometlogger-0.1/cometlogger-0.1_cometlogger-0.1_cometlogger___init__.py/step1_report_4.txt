  "purpose": "Import the 'hello' function or object from the local 'main' module",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module within the package",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this minimal code fragment",
  "anomalies": "Lack of context; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected in the import statement alone",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'hello' from a local module 'main'. There are no visible data inputs, outputs, or side effects. The import statement itself is standard and does not contain any malicious behavior. Without additional code, it is impossible to determine malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code are present here.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign but is incomplete for a thorough security assessment.",
