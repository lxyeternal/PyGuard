  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is visible in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal; it does not contain any suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are apparent.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a function from a local module. There are no external data sources, no untrusted data flows, and no evident malicious patterns. Without additional context or implementation details of 'main', there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The snippet appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is typical for a Python module import and does not present any security risks in isolation.",
