  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'cometlogger', with a description indicating it is a 'Comet Token Grabber'.",
  "sources": "The package metadata and dependencies specified in the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "The setup configuration itself does not include runtime data handling or untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "The setup process installs dependencies and registers the package; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The 'LONG_DESCRIPTION' explicitly states 'Token Grabber', which suggests malicious intent; the author name includes 'Gurucharan.dll', which may imply malicious naming or obfuscation. No other suspicious code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It declares dependencies on 'opencv-python', 'pyautogui', and 'pyaudio', which are legitimate libraries. The critical concern is the 'LONG_DESCRIPTION' text describing the package as a 'Token Grabber', indicating malicious intent or misuse. The author name further raises suspicion due to potential obfuscation or malicious branding. There are no code execution, data collection, or network communication features implemented here. The code itself is straightforward and structurally typical of a setup script, but the intent conveyed by the description is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script itself appears benign from a code perspective but is associated with a package described as a 'Token Grabber', indicating malicious intent. The package should not be used or distributed, as it aims to harvest tokens maliciously.",
