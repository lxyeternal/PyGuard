  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is benign and contains no malicious code. The high malware and risk scores are based on the package's metadata and declared purpose, which suggest malicious intent. For accurate assessment, the malware score should be 0, with a high security risk reflecting potential misuse. The package's purpose warrants caution, but the code itself is safe."
