  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a module named 'cometlogger'.",
  "sources": "No external input, secrets, or dynamic data; static code with imports and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external sources are used.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only calls setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "A typo: 'package=find_packages()' instead of 'packages=find_packages()'. This would cause a setup failure but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with a minor typo that affects functionality but not security. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The typo could prevent proper installation but does not introduce security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with a minor typo that could cause operational issues but no security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is 0.1 due to the typo's potential to cause setup failure. All reports are consistent with this assessment.",
