  "conclusion": "This script functions as a privacy-invasive data exfiltration tool, acting as an info-stealer with high security risks. While it does not contain active malicious payloads or obfuscation, its behavior warrants a high malware and security risk score. The current scores are appropriate, but the malware score could be slightly increased to better reflect the privacy invasion potential."
