{
  "purpose": "Collects and reports system information including user data, hardware specs, disk usage, network details, and WiFi passwords, then sends this data via a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads user environment variables, system commands (wmic, netsh), network responses, and screen capture images.",
  "sinks": "Sends data and images via Discord webhook; saves screenshot locally; executes system commands that may access hardware info.",
  "flows": "User/env data is gathered and formatted into embed fields; screen is captured and saved; system info retrieved from system commands; network info obtained from external API; WiFi passwords retrieved from system commands; all data is sent to Discord webhook.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. The code captures user data, system info, and WiFi passwords, and sends it externally without user consent. The script takes a screenshot of the user's display, potentially capturing sensitive information. Exception handling is overly broad, silently ignoring errors. No obfuscation or malicious code execution detected; use of system commands is standard but combined here for data collection.",
  "analysis": "The code performs extensive system and network information gathering, including sensitive details such as WiFi passwords and user display names. It captures a screenshot of the current screen and sends all collected data to a specified Discord webhook. While technically it does not contain obfuscated or malicious code, it effectively functions as spyware or info-stealer by exfiltrating potentially sensitive data without user consent. No backdoors, malicious payloads, or code injections are evident. The use of external requests and system commands is standard for info gathering but combined here to create a surveillance tool.",
  "conclusion": "This script acts as a comprehensive info-stealer tool, collecting detailed user and system data, including WiFi passwords and screenshots, and exfiltrating it via a webhook. It does not contain traditional malware or obfuscation, but its intent and data handling pose significant security and privacy risks. The overall security risk is high, given its data exfiltration behavior and access to sensitive information.",
