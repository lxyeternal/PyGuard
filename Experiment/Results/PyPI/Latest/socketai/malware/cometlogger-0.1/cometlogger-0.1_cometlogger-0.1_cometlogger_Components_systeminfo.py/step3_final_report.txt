  "purpose": "Collects system info, user data, network info, Wi-Fi passwords, geolocation, and screenshots, then exfiltrates via Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "ctypes.windll.secur32.GetUserNameExW, subprocess.check_output for system info and Wi-Fi passwords, requests.get for geolocation, environment variables for username and hostname, PIL.ImageGrab.grab for screenshots.",
  "sinks": "Webhook.send() for data exfiltration, file saving and deletion for screenshots.",
  "flows": "User/system info and Wi-Fi passwords are gathered and stored in variables, then sent via webhook; geolocation data fetched and included in message; screenshot captured and attached for exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive collection of Wi-Fi passwords, user display name, geolocation, and screenshots without user consent; broad exception handling hides errors; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs comprehensive data collection, including sensitive Wi-Fi passwords, user info, hardware details, geolocation, and screenshots. It then exfiltrates this data to a Discord webhook. No malicious payloads, code injection, or destructive actions are present. The use of broad exception handling could hide errors but does not indicate malicious intent. The data collection and exfiltration are privacy-invasive and potentially malicious in intent, though technically not active malware. The malware score should reflect high malicious potential due to privacy invasion, and the security risk score should be high accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions as a privacy-invasive data exfiltration tool, acting as an info-stealer with high security risks. While it does not contain active malicious payloads or obfuscation, its behavior warrants a high malware and security risk score. The current scores are appropriate, but the malware score could be slightly increased to better reflect the privacy invasion potential.",
