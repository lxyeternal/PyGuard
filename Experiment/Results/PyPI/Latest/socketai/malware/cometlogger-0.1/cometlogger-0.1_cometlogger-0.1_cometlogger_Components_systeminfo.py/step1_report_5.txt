{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information, including user details, hardware specs, disk usage, network info, and WiFi passwords, and sends this data to a specified Discord webhook, including a screenshot of the current screen.",
  "sources": "Reads user environment variables, system info via WMI and subprocess calls, network data from web requests, WiFi profiles via subprocess commands, and captures a screenshot using PIL.ImageGrab.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to a Discord webhook, saves and deletes a screenshot file locally.",
  "flows": "Collects system info -> formats data -> captures screenshot -> attaches screenshot to Discord embed -> sends webhook with embedded data and image.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. Uses potentially sensitive data (user info, WiFi passwords, system info) for exfiltration. No obfuscation or unusual language features. No network communication outside of data exfiltration to Discord and geolocation API. No code performs malicious system modifications or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to gather detailed system information, including user display name, hostname, username, hardware specs, disk usage, network info, WiFi passwords, and a screenshot. It then constructs a Discord embed message with this data and sends it via a webhook, along with the screenshot image. All data collection uses standard libraries and system commands; there is no evidence of malicious code or malicious intent such as reverse shells, data theft beyond info exfiltration, or system damage. The WiFi password extraction and data exfiltration are potentially malicious if used without consent. However, from the code alone, it appears to be an information-stealing tool, which is often associated with malware, but it does not contain actively harmful code like damage or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an information stealer, exfiltrating detailed system data and WiFi passwords to a Discord webhook. It does not contain any signs of active malware such as system damage, reverse shells, or backdoors. The primary risk is the privacy violation and potential misuse for malicious purposes. Given the focus on data exfiltration and credential harvesting, it can be considered malicious or at least malicious in intent, though it lacks direct destructive actions.",
