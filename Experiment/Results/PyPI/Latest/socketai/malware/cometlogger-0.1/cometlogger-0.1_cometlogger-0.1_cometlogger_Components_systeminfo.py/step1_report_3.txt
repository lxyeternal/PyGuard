{
  "purpose": "The code gathers system information, including user data, hardware specs, disk usage, network info, Wi-Fi credentials, and takes a screenshot, then sends this data to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('COMPUTERNAME', 'USERNAME'), system info via WMI, subprocess outputs for HWID and Wi-Fi details, network requests for geolocation and IP info, and captures a screenshot via PIL.ImageGrab.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to Discord webhook via webhook.send, uploads a screenshot as a file, makes external HTTP requests for geolocation info.",
  "flows": "Collects user/system/network data, then constructs embed messages and uploads screenshot, potentially exposing sensitive data to Discord webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Code actively captures and exfiltrates sensitive user information (hostname, username, hardware info, Wi-Fi passwords, geolocation), and captures a screenshot for exfiltration. Uses broad exception handling that suppresses errors silently, which may hide malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns beyond data collection and transmission are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script collects extensive system and network information, including Wi-Fi passwords, user display name, hardware details, IP address, geolocation, and a system screenshot. It then sends this data to a specified Discord webhook, effectively exfiltrating sensitive information. No obfuscated code, malicious payload, or backdoor mechanisms are present beyond data theft. The code is straightforward and aligns with malicious data exfiltration behavior. The use of broad try-except blocks might conceal errors, but the core behavior is consistent with malicious surveillance and data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a data exfiltration tool, collecting personal and system information and sending it to an external webhook, with no legitimate apparent purpose. It poses a high security risk due to active collection of sensitive data for potential malicious use.",
