  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows PE signature utility with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. Its capability to modify signatures arbitrarily introduces a potential security risk if misused, but the code itself is benign. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and a moderate risk score (~0.3-0.4) accurately reflects its potential for misuse. The existing reports' scores are consistent and justified."
