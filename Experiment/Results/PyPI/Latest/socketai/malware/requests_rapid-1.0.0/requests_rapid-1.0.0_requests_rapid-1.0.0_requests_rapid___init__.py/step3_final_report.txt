  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic execution (exec/eval), hardcoded credentials, network activity, input/output handling, obfuscation segments.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variables, data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to network/file sinks, possibly via dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscated code segments, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network addresses, dynamic code paths.",
  "analysis": "The code employs dynamic execution techniques and obfuscation, indicating potential for malicious activity. Hardcoded credentials and suspicious network activity further increase concern. No explicit malicious payloads or backdoors are confirmed, but the suspicious patterns justify elevated scores. Benign code shows straightforward data handling without obfuscation or suspicious behaviors. The suspicion levels align with the evidence, with higher risk in reports indicating network activity and obfuscation, and lower in benign, straightforward code.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits some suspicious features, notably in reports with obfuscation and network activity, warranting caution. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily driven by the high suspicion in certain reports. Benign reports show minimal risk. The scores are consistent with the observed behaviors and analysis.",
