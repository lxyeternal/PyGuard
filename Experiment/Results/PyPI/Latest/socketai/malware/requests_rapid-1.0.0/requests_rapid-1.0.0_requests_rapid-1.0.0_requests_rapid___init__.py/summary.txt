  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits some suspicious features, notably in reports with obfuscation and network activity, warranting caution. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily driven by the high suspicion in certain reports. Benign reports show minimal risk. The scores are consistent with the observed behaviors and analysis."
