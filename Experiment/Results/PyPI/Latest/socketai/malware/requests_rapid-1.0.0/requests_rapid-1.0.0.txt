      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious, covert data collection and exfiltration during package installation, constituting malicious behavior primarily aimed at privacy invasion and potential surveillance. The activity is consistent with spyware or malicious monitoring tools, warranting a malware score of 0.85 and a security risk score of 0.9. The code is not obfuscated, and the behavior indicates high malicious intent and security threat."

      "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits some suspicious features, notably in reports with obfuscation and network activity, warranting caution. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily driven by the high suspicion in certain reports. Benign reports show minimal risk. The scores are consistent with the observed behaviors and analysis."
