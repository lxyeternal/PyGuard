  "purpose": "The code collects detailed system and network information during package installation and transmits it to a remote server without explicit user consent, potentially for malicious surveillance or data exfiltration.",

    "Use of threading to hide network activity",
    "External API calls during install without user awareness",
    "Explicit comments warning about illegality and privacy invasion"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code performs extensive, covert collection of user and system information, including IP addresses and geolocation, during the installation process. It transmits this data to a remote server via HTTP POST requests in a background thread, aiming to avoid blocking the installation. The code explicitly states that it does not collect passwords and contains warnings about illegal activity, indicating malicious intent. The straightforward implementation and external API calls further suggest privacy invasion and potential malicious surveillance. The activity aligns with covert data exfiltration behaviors, with no obfuscation present, and the network communication is suspiciously embedded in the install process.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious, covert data collection and exfiltration during package installation, constituting malicious behavior primarily aimed at privacy invasion and potential surveillance. The activity is consistent with spyware or malicious monitoring tools, warranting a malware score of 0.85 and a security risk score of 0.9. The code is not obfuscated, and the behavior indicates high malicious intent and security threat.",
