  "purpose": "This code appears to be a setup script that, during installation, attempts to gather system information and send it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.environ.get('USER'), subprocess.check_output(['ls', '-alh', '/run/secrets/'])",
  "sinks": "HTTP PUT request to 'blackwolf.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com', sending base64-encoded system info or exception details",
  "flows": "Sources (current username and directory listing) are encoded and sent over network in send_put_request(), which is invoked during the install process if username matches 'modelarts'",
  "anomalies": "The code conditionally executes system commands and sends the output to a remote server during installation, which is unusual behavior for a package setup script",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to retrieve the current username, gather directory listing from '/run/secrets/', encode this data, and send it via an HTTP PUT request to a remote server. This is triggered during the custom installation process if the username is 'modelarts'. The act of sending system information during package installation is suspicious and could be used for data exfiltration or malicious monitoring. The code does not perform any malicious modifications to the system itself, but it does perform remote data transmission without user consent. The naming of the package and the obfuscated code suggest potential malicious intent, especially since sensitive directory '/run/secrets/' is accessed.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to a remote server during package installation, which could be used for unauthorized data collection. This activity indicates a supply chain security risk and malicious intent.",
