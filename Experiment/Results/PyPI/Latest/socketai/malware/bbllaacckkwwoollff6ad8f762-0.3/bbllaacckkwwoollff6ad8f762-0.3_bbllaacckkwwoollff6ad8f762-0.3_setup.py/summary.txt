  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by covertly exfiltrating sensitive secret directory contents during package installation when the username is 'modelarts'. This constitutes a high-severity supply chain security risk, with clear exfiltration intent and no obfuscation. The malware score is set to 1, and the security risk score is also 1, reflecting the high threat level."
