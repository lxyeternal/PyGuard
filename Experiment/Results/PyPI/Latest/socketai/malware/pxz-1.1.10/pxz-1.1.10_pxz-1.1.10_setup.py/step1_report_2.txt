{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information such as public IP, hostname, directories, and current time, then send this data to a specified remote server during installation of a Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads data from URL ('https://api.ipify.org') for public IP, os.uname() for hostname, os.path.expanduser() for home directory, os.getcwd() for current directory, and datetime.now() for current time.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET request to remote server ('http://35.170.187.220:8080/') with encoded system information as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Collects system info from sources, encodes as URL parameters, then transmits via URL request to remote server during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs background network activity during package installation, sending system info to an external IP without user consent. Uses a hardcoded server URL which could be malicious. No explicit user prompt or consent mechanism. The collected data includes potentially sensitive system info.",
  "analysis": "The script integrates into the package installation process via a custom command. It collects system data and sends it to a remote server upon installation, which could be used for tracking or malicious data collection. While the code does not include obfuscated or malicious code execution, the automatic transmission of system information without user awareness or consent is suspicious and could violate user privacy. The server IP appears hardcoded and external, raising concerns about potential malicious intent or data exfiltration. The code does not perform any malicious actions beyond data collection and transmission, but its behavior resembles surveillance or tracking activity that might be used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system data collection and automatically transmits it to an external server during package installation. This behavior could be malicious if done without user knowledge or consent. Although technically benign, it raises privacy concerns and potential misuse as a covert tracking mechanism.",
