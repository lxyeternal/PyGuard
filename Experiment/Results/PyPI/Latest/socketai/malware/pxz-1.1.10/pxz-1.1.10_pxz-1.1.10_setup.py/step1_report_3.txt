{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "URL requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' for public IP; request to 'http://35.170.187.220:8080/' with system info as URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to remote server with system information, potentially leaking sensitive data.",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() retrieves system data -> encodes as URL parameters -> sends GET request to remote server during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes automatic collection and transmission of system info upon package install; hardcoded server URL; use of standard libraries for network operations without user consent; logging to a file named 'install_log.txt'.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system information such as public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, and timestamp. It then encodes this data and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a fixed IP address, which could be a malicious or tracking server. The collection occurs during the installation process, triggered by a custom install command, which is suspicious because it executes network activity during setup without user explicit consent. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads like reverse shells or data theft mechanisms are present, but the automatic data exfiltration constitutes potentially malicious behavior. The use of public IP and system info transmission raises privacy concerns. The code is structured and uses standard libraries, with no signs of obfuscation or malware exploitation techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs system data collection and exfiltration during package installation without user approval, indicating potentially malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. It may be used for tracking or malicious data harvesting, warranting caution.",
