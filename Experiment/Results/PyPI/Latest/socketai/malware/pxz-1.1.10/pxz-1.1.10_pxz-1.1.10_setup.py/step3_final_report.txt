{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (public IP, hostname, directories, current time) and exfiltrates it to a remote server during package installation without user consent.",
  "sources": "urlopen('https://api.ipify.org'), os.uname().nodename, os.path.expanduser('~'), os.getcwd(), datetime.now()",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to 'http://35.170.187.220:8080/' with encoded system info parameters",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() gathers data from sources and sends it via a constructed URL to the server, invoked during the custom install command",
  "anomalies": "Silent data exfiltration during install, hardcoded server IP, no user notification or consent, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward collection of system info and transmits it to a remote server during package installation, which is privacy-invasive. No malicious payloads or destructive actions are present. The exfiltration occurs silently, indicating potential malicious intent or privacy violation. The code is clear and unobfuscated, with standard libraries used. The primary concern is covert data collection without user awareness, which could be exploited for malicious tracking or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code acts as a covert data exfiltration tool embedded within a package installer, raising significant privacy and security concerns. While it does not contain active malicious payloads, its behavior warrants a high malware and security risk score due to privacy invasion and potential misuse.",
