{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information such as IP address, hostname, directories, and current time, then send this data to a specified remote server during the installation process of the package.",
  "sources": "URL requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' for public IP, and the constructed URL to 'http://35.170.187.220:8080/' for data transmission. Also reads system info via os and datetime modules.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request sent to remote server with system info as URL parameters, which can potentially leak sensitive system data to an external entity.",
  "flows": "System info collected from local system and URL, then encoded into URL parameters, and sent via an HTTP GET request to the remote server during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically transmits system information to a remote server without user consent, which is unusual behavior for a typical package. Use of a fixed server IP and sending data during install is suspicious. Logging to a file is standard, but combined with external data transmission raises concern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to collect various system details including public IP, hostname, directories, and current time. It constructs a URL with this data and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external server. This occurs during the custom installation process, which is triggered automatically when the package is installed. The URL and server address are hardcoded, and the data transmission happens without any explicit user notification or opt-in, indicating potential malicious intent or privacy violation. No obfuscated code or malicious payload like reverse shells or data theft beyond info leakage is detected. The intent appears to be passive data collection and exfiltration, which is suspicious but not overtly harmful beyond privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The package performs automated collection and transmission of system information to an external server during installation, without user consent. This behavior resembles data exfiltration and raises privacy concerns. While not malicious malware in the traditional sense, it presents significant security and privacy risks, warranting caution.",
