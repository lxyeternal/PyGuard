{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information such as IP address, hostname, directories, and current time, then send this data to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "URLError from urlopen, urlopen calls for IP and data transmission, os.uname() for hostname, os.path.expanduser() and os.getcwd() for directories, datetime.now() for current time.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request via urlopen with constructed URL containing system info, potentially exposing sensitive data if intercepted or misused.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system sources flows into URL parameters, then sent via HTTP GET request to the remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Code collects and transmits system information without explicit user consent or notification, sending data to a specific IP address. No validation or encryption of data, and server URL hardcoded. The code performs network activity during installation which could be malicious or privacy-invasive.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system data including IP address, hostname, user home directory, current working directory, and timestamp. It constructs a URL with these parameters and sends an HTTP GET request to a specific IP address. The process occurs automatically during package installation via a custom install command. The code does not ask for user permission and transmits potentially sensitive system info, which can be considered malicious or privacy-invasive. The server address is hardcoded and not related to the package’s declared purpose, indicating possible data exfiltration or tracking. No obfuscated code, but the behavior is suspicious due to data collection and transmission during install.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and sends it to a remote server without user consent, which could be used for malicious surveillance or data exfiltration. The behavior is privacy-invasive and suspicious for supply chain malicious activity. No malicious payload such as remote shell or destructive actions is present, but the data exfiltration aspect raises security concerns.",
