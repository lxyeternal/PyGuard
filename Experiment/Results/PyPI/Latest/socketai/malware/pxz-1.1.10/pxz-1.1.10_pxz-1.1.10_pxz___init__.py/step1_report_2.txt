  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are identifiable without code content.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths can be determined without actual code logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be empty or contains no executable statements, which is unusual if it is intended to perform any function.",
  "analysis": "Given the absence of code, there are no observable source, sink, or flow activities. This lack of content suggests either an incomplete file or a placeholder. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs can be identified in an empty or placeholder code file.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no executable logic or data handling, making it unlikely to pose any security threat. It appears to be an empty or placeholder file with no malicious behavior.",
