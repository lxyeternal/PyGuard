{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface (CLI) helper that displays help information for a set of predefined commands related to a 'Pojang Resorter' tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments through argparse.ArgumentParser and sys.argv (implicitly).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data in a way that could cause data leaks or malicious effects. The code only displays help information.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv (command-line arguments) is processed by argparse. No data flows from input to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior. The show_help() function only displays help info without performing any other actions.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function that sets up an argument parser with predefined commands and then displays help information when run directly. It does not execute any commands or perform actions based on input. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help display script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply provides help instructions for a set of commands.",
