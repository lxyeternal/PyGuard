  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines a function `show_help()` that creates an `ArgumentParser` with a description and a positional argument `command` with specific choices.\n- When run directly, it calls `show_help()`, which prints the help message.\n- The code does not process or execute commands; it only displays help information.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code only displays help information and does not perform any malicious actions. There are no signs of data leaks, command execution, or malicious payloads.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning?**  \n  The reports uniformly agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for a CLI help utility. No errors are evident in their reasoning.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n  - Security risk scores are also 0 or very close to 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n  - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified given the simplicity of the code.\n  - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct; the code is not obfuscated.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The code does **not** process untrusted data beyond command-line argument parsing.\n- It does **not** execute commands, perform network activity, or handle secrets.\n- The only potential concern could be if this code were part of a larger, malicious system, but based solely on this snippet, no such issues are present.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are justified.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, not obfuscated.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n**Overall:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a simple, benign CLI help utility with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
