{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface (CLI) help menu for a tool called 'Pojang Resorter'. It allows users to see help information and available commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line input via the argparse.ArgumentParser and command argument.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leakage or system impact.",
  "flows": "User input from command-line arguments is parsed and used to display help; no data flows to other parts of the system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code solely creates a help message.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an argument parser with a description and a single positional argument 'command' with predefined choices. The show_help() function calls parser.print_help() to display usage info. No input processing beyond argument parsing occurs. The code does not execute any commands, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. There is no indication of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward CLI help utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity.",
