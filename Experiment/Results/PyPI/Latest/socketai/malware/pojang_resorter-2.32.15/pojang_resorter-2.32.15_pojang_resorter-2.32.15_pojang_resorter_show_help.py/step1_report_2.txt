  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine user input commands.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data beyond displaying help information.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments flows into argparse, which processes and displays help messages based on predefined choices.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only handles help display with predefined options.",

There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious actions. It is a standard CLI help implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a CLI help menu for a tool, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a benign, standard implementation.",
