{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for a tool named 'Pojang Resorter' with help functionality.",
  "sources": "Reads user input via command-line arguments using argparse.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "User input is processed to select commands, but no commands are executed within this script.",
  "anomalies": "Contains no suspicious or unusual code behavior. The help function and argument parsing are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports argparse for command-line argument parsing, defines a function to show help information, and calls this function if the script runs as main. No data from external sources is processed beyond command-line arguments, and no commands are executed dynamically or maliciously. The script appears to be a simple CLI help utility for a larger tool, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI help utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides usage information for the 'Pojang Resorter' CLI tool.",
