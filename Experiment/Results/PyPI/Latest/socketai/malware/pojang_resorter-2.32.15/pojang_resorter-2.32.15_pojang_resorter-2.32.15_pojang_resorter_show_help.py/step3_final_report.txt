{
  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line help interface for the 'Pojang Resorter' CLI tool, displaying available commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads no untrusted input; it only defines a help display function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; the code does not process or execute commands beyond printing help.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only outputs static help information.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports argparse, defines a function to show help with predefined commands, and calls this function if run directly. It does not process user input beyond argument parsing, nor does it execute commands or perform network or file operations. The code is simple, clear, and standard for a CLI help utility, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help utility with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The only minor inconsistency is a report assigning a security risk of 0.1, which is unwarranted given the code's simplicity. Therefore, the overall assessment confirms the code is safe, with no security concerns.",
