{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface (CLI) help display for the 'Pojang Resorter' tool, showing available commands.",
  "sources": "Input source is the command-line argument 'command' processed by argparse. The data read is from sys.argv via argparse.",
  "fires": "Potentially, untrusted command-line input could influence program flow if used beyond this snippet, but here it only displays help.",
  "flows": "Command-line input is read by argparse but not used further; no sensitive data or untrusted data flows are evident beyond command reading.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscation or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to display help information for a CLI tool using argparse. It accepts a command argument with specific choices and prints help info. It does not process or execute the commands beyond showing help, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious data handling. The code is simple and clear, with no anomalies or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI help display script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely provides help information for specified commands.",
