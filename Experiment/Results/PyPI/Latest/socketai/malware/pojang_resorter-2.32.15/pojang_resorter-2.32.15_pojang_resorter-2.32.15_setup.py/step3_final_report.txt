  "purpose": "Standard package configuration for 'pojang_resorter' including dependencies, entry points, and Python version requirements.",
  "sources": "The setup() function defining packages, install_requires, entry_points, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; setup script does not process untrusted data or execute code beyond configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the script only declares package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "None; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, listing dependencies related to GUI automation, image processing, HTTP requests, and testing. It contains no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The dependencies could perform malicious actions when used at runtime, but this is outside the scope of the setup script itself. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. The security risk score is minimal (0.2) to account for potential misuse of dependencies during runtime, but the setup code remains safe.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign configuration script with no malicious or obfuscated code. The minor security risk score reflects potential runtime misuse of dependencies, not the setup code itself. Overall, the package is safe for use.",
