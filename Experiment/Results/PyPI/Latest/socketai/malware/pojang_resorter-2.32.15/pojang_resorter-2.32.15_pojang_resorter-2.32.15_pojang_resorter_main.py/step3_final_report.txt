  "purpose": "A CLI dispatcher that maps specific commands to scripts and executes them via subprocess, with command validation and logging.",
  "sources": "User input command via argparse; script existence check via Path.exists()",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing external scripts",
  "flows": "Command input -> command map lookup -> script path verification -> subprocess.run() execution",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity; standard subprocess usage with command restrictions",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward command dispatcher that restricts commands to predefined options, verifies script existence, and executes scripts via subprocess. It logs errors and provides user feedback. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present. The security depends on the integrity of the external scripts called, but the dispatcher itself is benign. The command choices are limited, reducing arbitrary execution risk. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk assuming trusted scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI command dispatcher with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. Its security posture relies on the trustworthiness of the external scripts it executes. The risk is minimal due to command restrictions and existence checks.",
