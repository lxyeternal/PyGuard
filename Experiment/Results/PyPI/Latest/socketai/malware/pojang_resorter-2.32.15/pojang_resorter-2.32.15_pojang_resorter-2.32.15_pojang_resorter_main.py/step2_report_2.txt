  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward CLI dispatcher that executes scripts based on user commands. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are identified. The code relies on external scripts, but the dispatcher itself is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score reflects the benign nature, and malware score is zero, which aligns with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as a command dispatcher that runs external scripts via subprocess. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** The risk score is low, reflecting the benign design; malware remains zero.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a safe CLI wrapper with command validation, proper checks, and no malicious intent. The subprocess usage is controlled via predefined commands.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** Slightly lower risk score aligns with the minimal concerns expressed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports; the code is a command dispatcher with safe practices, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No change needed; the low risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; the script is a benign CLI wrapper with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code does not exhibit any malicious patterns such as code injection, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, and the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's nature as a dispatcher that executes external scripts, the main concern is trust in those scripts. The code itself is safe, but if the scripts are malicious, the overall risk increases. However, since the code restricts commands to predefined options and verifies script existence, the risk is minimal.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, well-structured CLI dispatcher.\n- The main potential risk is reliance on external scripts, which are outside the scope of this code review.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- Maintain the current low malware and obfuscated scores.\n- Keep the risk score at around 0.2, considering external script trustworthiness.\n- Ensure scripts executed are from trusted sources and verify their integrity as part of broader security practices.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
