{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Imports the main function from the local module '.main'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is limited to module metadata and a single import.",
  "anomalies": "Lacks any suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs. No obfuscation or malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports a main function from a local module. There are no external data inputs, network communications, or security-sensitive operations. The structure is minimal and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving as an entry point and metadata holder. No signs of malicious behavior or malware, and no anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard package initialization code with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It is a benign module setup file.",
