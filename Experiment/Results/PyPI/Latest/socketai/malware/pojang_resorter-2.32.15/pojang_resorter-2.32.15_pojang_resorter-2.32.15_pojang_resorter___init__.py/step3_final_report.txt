{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal package initialization module, providing metadata and importing the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata variables (__version__, __author__) and imports the 'main' function from a local module (.main).",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks, external data flows, or network interactions present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code's flow involves reading static variables and importing a local module; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that sets package metadata and imports a main function, typical for a Python package's __init__.py or entry point. It contains no dynamic code, network calls, or data processing. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It functions as a standard package setup component. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and do not require modification.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
