  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal Python module that:\n     - Contains a docstring describing it as the \"Pojang Resorter Package.\"\n     - Imports `main` from a local `.main` module.\n     - Sets `__version__` and `__author__` metadata variables.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, dynamic code execution, network calls, or other suspicious behaviors.\n\n2. **Report Consistency and Logical Evaluation:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no data flows, no untrusted data handling, and no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is typical for a package's `__init__.py` or main module, serving as an entry point with metadata.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`. Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns, this is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`. The code is clear, with no signs of obfuscation.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign `0`. No vulnerabilities or security issues are evident.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Overestimations:**\n   - Since the code is minimal and benign, the scores are appropriate.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are necessary; the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n5. **Final Assessment:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n6. **Additional Recommendations:**\n   - Based on the provided code and reports, no changes to scores are necessary.\n   - If future code includes dynamic behavior or external interactions, reassessment would be needed.\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Aspect                | Score / Justification                                            |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score         | 0 — No malicious code or behavior present                        |\n| Obfuscated Score     | 0 — Clear, straightforward code without obfuscation             |\n| Security Risk Score  | 0 — No vulnerabilities or risky operations identified           |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and poses no security threat.**",
