{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, including importing the main function and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main import main; package metadata variables __version__ and __author__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external input/output operations observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only static imports and variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs; minimal code structure with only metadata and import",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a main function from a local module and defines version and author metadata. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no external interactions that could indicate malicious intent. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or main module, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign package initialization script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
