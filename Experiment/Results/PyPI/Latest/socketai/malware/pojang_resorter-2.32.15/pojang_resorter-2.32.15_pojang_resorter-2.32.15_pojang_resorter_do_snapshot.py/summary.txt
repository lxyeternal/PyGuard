  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by silently capturing and exfiltrating sensitive data without user consent. The straightforward implementation and hardcoded exfiltration endpoint confirm its potential for abuse as spyware or surveillance malware. The assigned malware score of 0.75 and security risk score of 0.75 are appropriate; considering the severity, slightly increasing these scores to 0.8 would be justified for a conservative assessment."
