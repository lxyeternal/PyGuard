  "purpose": "Capture a screenshot silently and send it to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reading the system screen via PIL.ImageGrab.grab() and obtaining the image data in-memory.",
  "sinks": "Sending the image data via HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Screenshot captured (source) → image data stored in memory → sent via requests.post to webhook URL (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which could be malicious if used to exfiltrate sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions. No user input is involved, and the code performs an automated screenshot and exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script silently captures a screenshot without user consent and uploads it directly to a predefined Discord webhook. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating potential malicious intent to exfiltrate screen data. The use of requests.post with files parameter facilitates image upload. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no other suspicious patterns are present. The code performs a straightforward data exfiltration operation, which could be used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a screen capture tool that exfiltrates screenshots to a remote server via a webhook. The hardcoded webhook URL and silent operation suggest malicious intent, possibly for espionage or unauthorized monitoring. This behavior is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious.",
