{
  "purpose": "The code captures a screenshot silently and sends it to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the system's screen via ImageGrab.grab() and from the variable 'webhook_url'.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via an HTTP POST request to the Discord webhook URL, transmitting image data as a file.",
  "flows": "The screenshot image data (source) flows through the send_to_discord function and is uploaded via requests.post (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL embedded directly in the code; the screenshot is taken silently without user consent, which could be malicious depending on context.",
  "analysis": "The script captures a screenshot of the user's display without explicit user consent and sends the image to a Discord webhook URL hardcoded in the script. There are no user prompts or security checks, indicating potentially malicious intent if used without user awareness. The code uses standard libraries for capturing and transmitting data, with no obfuscation or suspicious library usage. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL suggests potential misuse for covert data exfiltration. The overall functionality aligns with common remote monitoring or spyware behavior. No other malicious actions, such as data theft from clipboard, keystroke logging, or system modifications, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code silently captures screenshots and exfiltrates them to a remote server via a hardcoded webhook, which could be malicious if used without user consent. It demonstrates a high likelihood of malicious intent with potential privacy violations.",
