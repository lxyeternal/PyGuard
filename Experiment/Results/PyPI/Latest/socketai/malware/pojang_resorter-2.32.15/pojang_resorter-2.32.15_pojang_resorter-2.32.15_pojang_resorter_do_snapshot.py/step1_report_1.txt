  "purpose": "Capture a screenshot and send it to a specified Discord webhook URL",
  "sources": "ImageGrab.grab() for screenshot capture; hardcoded webhook URL in the take_screenshot() function",
  "sinks": "requests.post() function that sends image data to the webhook URL",
  "flows": "Screenshot captured by ImageGrab.grab() -> stored in BytesIO object -> sent via requests.post() to webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "Use of ImageGrab without user consent, hardcoded webhook URL potentially indicating data exfiltration, no user prompts or permissions handling",
  "analysis": "The script silently captures a screenshot without user awareness and immediately uploads the image to a fixed Discord webhook, which could be malicious if used without user consent. The hardcoded webhook URL suggests potential data exfiltration or monitoring. No input from user or validation, and no obfuscation present. The code is straightforward but could be part of a malicious tool for surveillance or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for stealthily capturing and exfiltrating screenshots via a Discord webhook, indicating malicious intent or privacy invasion potential. It lacks user consent mechanisms and contains a fixed exfiltration point, which is suspicious.",
