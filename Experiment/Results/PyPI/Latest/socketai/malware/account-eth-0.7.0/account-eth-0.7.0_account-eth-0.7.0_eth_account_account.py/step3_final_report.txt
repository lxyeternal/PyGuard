  "purpose": "Ethereum account management functions including key creation, encryption/decryption, signing, recovery, and mnemonic features.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., 'account_eth_KDF'), user inputs (private keys, mnemonics, encrypted JSON), cryptographic libraries.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic operations (signing, encrypting, decrypting), outputting signatures, account addresses, encrypted key files.",
  "flows": "Input data (keys, mnemonics, environment variables) flows into cryptographic functions; outputs include signatures, decrypted keys, addresses, encrypted JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscation, explicit warnings about experimental mnemonic features, guarded behind flags.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cryptographic libraries (eth_keys, eth_typing, etc.), handles sensitive data explicitly, and contains no malicious or obfuscated logic. The experimental mnemonic features are explicitly flagged and guarded, indicating caution but not malicious intent. No suspicious data flows, network activity, or backdoors are present. The scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Ethereum account management library with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects caution due to experimental features, but overall, the supply chain security appears sound.",
