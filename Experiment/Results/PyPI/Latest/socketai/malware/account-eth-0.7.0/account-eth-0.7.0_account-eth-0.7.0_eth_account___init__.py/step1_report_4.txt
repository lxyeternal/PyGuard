  "purpose": "This code exports the Account class from the account_eth.account module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing Account from an external module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow; import is static and does not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code, no suspicious variables, or unusual patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class and defines __all__ for export. No input handling, data processing, or external network interactions are present. The import path suggests modular code organization, but provides no indication of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple module export with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
