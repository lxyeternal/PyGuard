  "purpose": "The code defines an import statement that imports the 'Account' class from the 'account_eth.account' module and exposes it via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'account_eth.account' module to import the 'Account' class.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is used or could cause a leak.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; there are no data flows or untrusted data processing in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain any suspicious or unusual patterns such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module import and export statement with no logic or data manipulation. It imports a class named 'Account' and exposes it via __all__, following standard Python practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leaks. The code's structure and content are typical for a module that re-exports an object.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exposes the 'Account' class from another module.",
