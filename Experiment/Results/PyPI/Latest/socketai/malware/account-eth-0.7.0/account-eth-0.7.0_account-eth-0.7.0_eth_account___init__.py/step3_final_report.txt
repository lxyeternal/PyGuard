  "purpose": "Re-export of the Account class from account_eth.account module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from account_eth.account",
  "sinks": "None; static import, no data flow or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "Import from account_eth.account to module namespace",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, static, and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external module and exposes it via __all__, serving as a simple re-export. No dynamic code execution, data processing, or network activity is present. The code structure is standard and benign. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module re-export with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the static analysis.",
