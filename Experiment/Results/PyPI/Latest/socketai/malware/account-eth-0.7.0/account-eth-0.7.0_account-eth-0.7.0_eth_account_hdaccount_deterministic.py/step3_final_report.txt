  "purpose": "Implementation of hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet key derivation following BIP-0032, BIP-0043, and BIP-0044 standards, focusing on private key derivation from seed and path parsing.",
  "sources": "Seed bytes, path strings, parent private key, parent chain code, external cryptographic functions (hmac_sha512, to_int, ec_point).",
  "sinks": "Derived private keys, chain codes, cryptographic outputs, recursive calls for invalid keys.",
  "flows": "Seed → master node via HMAC → path parsing → derive_child_key for each node → final private key.",
  "anomalies": "Recursive handling of invalid keys in derive_child_key(), which is standard in HD wallets; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements BIP-0032/43/44 derivation, validating inputs, using cryptographic primitives properly, and handling invalid keys via recursion—common in HD wallet implementations. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External functions are assumed secure. The recursive invalid key handling, while potentially causing deep recursion in pathological cases, is a standard pattern and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of HD wallet key derivation, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities beyond typical cryptographic risks. The recursive invalid key handling is standard practice. Overall, it is safe and purpose-driven.",
