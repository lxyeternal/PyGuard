{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for signed transactions and messages related to cryptographic operations, using NamedTuple for organized data storage.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reading mechanisms present.",
  "targets": "No sinks or data output points, especially no untrusted data handling or external calls.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; data structures are static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual pattern of defining __getitem__ as a standalone function and reusing it within class methods; no other anomalies or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two NamedTuple classes, SignedTransaction and SignedMessage, each with a __getitem__ method that relies on a globally defined __getitem__ function. The __getitem__ function attempts to access tuple items or object attributes, providing flexible indexing. There are no external data sources, no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets or malicious logic. The code appears to be straightforward data structure definitions with custom item access methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of NamedTuple data structures for cryptographic entities. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. The unusual reuse of a helper function for __getitem__ is benign and appears to be a stylistic choice.",
