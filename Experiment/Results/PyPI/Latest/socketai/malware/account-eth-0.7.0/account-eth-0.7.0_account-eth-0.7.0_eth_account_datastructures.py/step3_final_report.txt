  "purpose": "Define cryptographic signature data structures with custom item access methods.",
  "sources": "Attributes within SignedTransaction and SignedMessage classes, and the external __getitem__ function used within class methods.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Class methods call external __getitem__(self, index) to access data attributes or tuple items.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual placement of __getitem__ as a global function outside class scope; potential for scope-related runtime errors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two NamedTuple classes with custom __getitem__ methods that invoke an external function. This external function accesses tuple elements or object attributes, providing flexible indexing. The pattern is unconventional and could cause runtime errors if __getitem__ is not properly in scope, but it does not introduce malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no external data handling, network activity, or malicious payloads. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The main concern is the stylistic choice rather than security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The unusual placement of __getitem__ is a stylistic issue that could cause runtime errors but does not pose security risks. The scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
