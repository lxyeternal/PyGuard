{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for signed transactions and messages with custom item access",
  "sources": "No explicit external data sources; class attributes are assigned at initialization",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks, no network, file I/O, or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are simple data containers",
  "anomalies": "The __getitem__ method is defined outside of classes and used within class methods, which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code defines two NamedTuple classes, SignedTransaction and SignedMessage, each with attributes related to cryptographic signatures. A helper function __getitem__ is defined at the module level and used within class methods to access tuple elements. No external data input, network activity, or unsafe operations are present. The code appears to be a straightforward data structure definition with a non-standard but benign method for item access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data structure setup for handling signed cryptographic messages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The unusual use of a module-level __getitem__ function is non-standard but not harmful.",
