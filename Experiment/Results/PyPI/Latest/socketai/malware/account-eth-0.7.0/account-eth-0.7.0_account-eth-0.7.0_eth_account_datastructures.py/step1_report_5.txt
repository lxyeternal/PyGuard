{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for signed Ethereum transactions and messages using NamedTuple, with custom __getitem__ methods.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only local data structures and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network operations, or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only internal attribute access within data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Custom __getitem__ implementation is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces NamedTuple subclasses for SignedTransaction and SignedMessage, with a custom __getitem__ function defined at the module level. These classes are intended for structured data representation related to cryptographic signatures. The __getitem__ method provides flexibility in data access. No external data, user input, or system interactions are present. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic. The overall design appears standard for data container classes, with an unusual but benign custom __getitem__ implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of data structures with custom access methods, exhibiting no malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or malware indicators are detected.",
