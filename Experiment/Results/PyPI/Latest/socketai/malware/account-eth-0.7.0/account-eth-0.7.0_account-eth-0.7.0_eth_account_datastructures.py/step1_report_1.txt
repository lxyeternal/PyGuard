{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for signed transactions and messages, including custom __getitem__ methods for indexing.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or effect are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines data structures and methods.",
  "anomalies": "Custom __getitem__ method defined outside class scope; no malicious or suspicious code detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two NamedTuple classes, SignedTransaction and SignedMessage, with attributes related to cryptographic signatures. A standalone __getitem__ function is defined outside class scope and used within the classes' __getitem__ methods, which may cause a NameError unless __getitem__ is globally defined elsewhere. No external input reading, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is simple, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data structure definition with an unusual placement of the __getitem__ function, which may be a bug rather than malicious intent. There is no malware, malicious behavior, or security risk present.",
