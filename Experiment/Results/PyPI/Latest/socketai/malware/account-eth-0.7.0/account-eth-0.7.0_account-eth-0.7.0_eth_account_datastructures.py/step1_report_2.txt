{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for signed Ethereum transactions and messages with custom item access methods.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code only defines classes and methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom __getitem__ method outside standard practice; no security-sensitive operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two NamedTuple classes, SignedTransaction and SignedMessage, to structure cryptographic signature data. It includes a custom __getitem__ function for index access, which is a simple utility method. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no output or network interactions. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are detected. The custom __getitem__ is a benign utility, not obfuscated or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward data structure definitions with a utility method, showing no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
