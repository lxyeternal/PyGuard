  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, defining dependencies and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, dependencies in install_requires and extras_require, package data files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static setup script with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package. It reads a README file, specifies dependencies, package data, and uses find_packages. There are no dynamic or runtime behaviors, no user input handling, no network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious code segments. All signals indicate benign, standard packaging code. The scores assigned in the initial reports are consistent with this assessment, except for a minor inconsistency in report 2 where the security risk score of 0.1 should be adjusted to 0, given the absence of any vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The initial reports correctly identify this, with the only correction being to set the security risk score in report 2 to 0. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero across all reports.",
