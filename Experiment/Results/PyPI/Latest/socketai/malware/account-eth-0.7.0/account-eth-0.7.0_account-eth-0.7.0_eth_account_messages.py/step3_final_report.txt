  "purpose": "Functions for encoding and hashing Ethereum messages according to EIP-191 and EIP-712 standards, including validation and message preparation for signing.",
  "sources": "Input addresses, message data, structured data, and validation functions reading from parameters and external validation routines.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic hashing (keccak), data validation, and message construction; no network or file I/O involved.",
  "flows": "Validation of addresses and data -> construction of SignableMessage objects -> hashing functions (keccak, hash_domain, hash_message) -> output hashes or signable messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or external calls; standard cryptographic and validation routines used as intended.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard Ethereum message encoding functions with proper validation and cryptographic hashing. It does not contain malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The validation steps and data conversions are straightforward. No network activity or external dependencies suggest malicious intent. The code is well-structured and aligns with known standards, with no anomalies indicating sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for Ethereum message encoding and hashing, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to lack of external audit but no active vulnerabilities or malicious patterns detected.",
