  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some form of data processing or utility function, likely involving input handling and possibly output or logging.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, user input, or files (depending on the code content).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands that could be used to exfiltrate data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or system commands), potentially passing through processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious code structures detected. Unusual dynamic execution or obfuscation methods are absent. Code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Step 1: Reviewed all import statements for suspicious libraries; none found. Step 2: Checked for hardcoded secrets or credentials; none detected. Step 3: Examined input handling; no signs of unsafe evaluation or injection points. Step 4: Assessed data flow; no untrusted data reaching sensitive sinks in suspicious ways. Step 5: Looked for obfuscation or malware indicators; none identified. Overall, the code appears benign, performing standard processing tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a typical utility or processing script with no suspicious activities.",
