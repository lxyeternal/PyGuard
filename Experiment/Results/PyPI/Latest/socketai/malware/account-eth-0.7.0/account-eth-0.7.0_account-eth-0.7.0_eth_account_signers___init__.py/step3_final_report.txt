  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval, exec, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, and standard data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, or data leaks; none explicitly identified in provided code.",
  "flows": "Potential source (input, secrets) to sink (network, file), especially in code with eval/exec or secrets.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval, exec, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation signs in Report 4; otherwise none.",
  "analysis": "Most reports show benign code with no suspicious patterns, matching their low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 4 exhibits signs of obfuscation and malicious constructs, justifying high scores. Scores are consistent with the analysis; benign reports have low scores, Report 4's high scores reflect its suspicious nature.",
  "conclusion": "The scores are appropriate and justified based on the detailed analysis. Report 4 correctly flags potential malicious behavior with high malware and obfuscation scores. Other reports are benign with low scores. No adjustments needed; scores accurately reflect threat levels.",
