{
  "purpose": "Implements BIP39 mnemonic generation, validation, and seed derivation supporting multiple languages, using cryptographically secure methods and external wordlists.",
  "sources": "Reading wordlist files from disk, entropy generation via os.urandom, mnemonic input for validation and expansion, seed derivation via pbkdf2_hmac_sha512.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network activity; validation compares digests securely, and seed derivation is local.",
  "flows": "Entropy generated with os.urandom → converted to bits → checksum appended → indices mapped to words → mnemonic output; validation compares stored and computed checksums.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard cryptographic practices. External wordlist dependency is noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of BIP39 mnemonic handling. It uses secure cryptographic functions, caches wordlists, and performs proper validation. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. External dependencies are typical for such applications. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external file integrity, which is outside the code scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of mnemonic seed management with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It adheres to cryptographic standards and best practices, with a very low security risk. The scores are consistent with the analysis.",
