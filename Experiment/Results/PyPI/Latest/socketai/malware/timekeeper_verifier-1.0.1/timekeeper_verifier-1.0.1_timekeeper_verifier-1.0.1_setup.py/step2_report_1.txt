  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code reads a local README.md file for long description, which is standard practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code appears to be a typical, benign setup script.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, readable code.\n- Security risk score: 0, consistent with the analysis that there's no security concern.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- All reports uniformly assign maximum confidence (1 or 1.0) and zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores.\n- The reasoning is sound; no evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- The code is a canonical setup.py file, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores should remain as they are: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- The confidence level is justified at 1, given the comprehensive analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores or reasoning are necessary.\n- The code is safe and standard for its purpose.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- Confirm that the package is safe based on the provided analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the evidence provided.",
