  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code uses standard setup procedures without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package setup, defines package metadata variables, reads the README.md for long description, and passes all configuration to setup(). There are no input data from untrusted sources beyond static file reading. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears to follow standard practices for Python package configuration without suspicious constructs.",
