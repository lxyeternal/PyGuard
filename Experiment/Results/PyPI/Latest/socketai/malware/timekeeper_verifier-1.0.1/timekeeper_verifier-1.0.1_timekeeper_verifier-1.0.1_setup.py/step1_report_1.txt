  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python package named 'timekeeper-verifier'.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None that process untrusted data directly; setup parameters are static.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> sets setup parameters -> calls setup() with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' to configure package metadata and find packages excluding test directories. It reads 'README.md' to include as long description. The setup arguments are static strings and data, including version, description, author, license, and classifiers. The package name is consistent with the package filename. No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The script appears to be a standard setup.py file for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
