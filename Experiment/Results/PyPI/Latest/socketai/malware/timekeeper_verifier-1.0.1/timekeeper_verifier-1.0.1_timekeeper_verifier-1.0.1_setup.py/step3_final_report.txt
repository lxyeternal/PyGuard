  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata and reading a local README for description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; static variables for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, user input, or external data sources are used.",
  "flows": "Static metadata variables passed directly to setuptools.setup() without dynamic or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static code with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, defines static metadata variables, reads a local README.md file for the long description, and calls setup() with these parameters. There are no user inputs, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The code is static, well-structured, and follows standard practices. No malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code segments are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence score is justified at 1, given the thorough static analysis and absence of any suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores are appropriate and justified, indicating a safe package. No modifications are necessary.",
