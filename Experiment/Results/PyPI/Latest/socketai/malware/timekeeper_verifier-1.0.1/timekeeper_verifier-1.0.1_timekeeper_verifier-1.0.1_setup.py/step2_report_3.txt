  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- No untrusted input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The code appears to be a typical, benign package setup script.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- The code reads a local README.md file for the long description.\n- Static package metadata is defined and passed to setuptools.setup().\n- No anomalies, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n- The scores assigned by reports are all at the maximum confidence level (1.0), with malware and securityRisk scores at 0.\n\n**Review of scores:**\n\n- Malware score: all reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated score: all assign 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- Risk score: all assign 0, justified given the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analyses, the code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' consensus and the code's straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-formed Python packaging script with no malicious or security concerns. The existing scores are appropriate and justified.",
