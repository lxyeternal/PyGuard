  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'timekeeper_verifier' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; setup parameters are static or derived from local files",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content into 'long_description' and passing static setup parameters to 'setup()'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard setup procedures, static metadata, and package discovery",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, defines package metadata, reads 'README.md' for long description, and calls 'setup()' with the collected parameters. All data is static or from local files; there are no dynamic inputs, network activity, or suspicious code. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly handles package setup with static data.",
