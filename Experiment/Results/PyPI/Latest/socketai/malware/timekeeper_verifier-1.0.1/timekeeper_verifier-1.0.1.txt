The activity appears to be covert communication or data collection, warranting caution but not definitive maliciousness. The scores are justified; a slightly conservative malware score (~0.2-0.3) and moderate risk (~0.4-0.5) are appropriate given the context."

Scores should reflect suspicion levels, with higher malware (~0.6) and risk (~0.6-0.65) for reports indicating eval and obfuscation, and minimal scores for benign or absent code. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious packages."
