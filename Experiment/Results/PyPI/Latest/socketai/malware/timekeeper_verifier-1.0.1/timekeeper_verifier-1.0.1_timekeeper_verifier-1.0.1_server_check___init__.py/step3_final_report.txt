  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading environment variables, file operations, dynamic execution (eval), obfuscated code segments.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, system modifications, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or files feed into functions that may execute or transmit data, with eval or network calls as sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval, obfuscation techniques, minimal or highly obfuscated code, hardcoded strings, dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. Reports with eval and obfuscation techniques are justified in assigning higher malware scores (~0.6). Reports lacking code or with benign patterns have low scores. The suspicion level in reports 2 and 3 warrants increased malware (~0.6) and risk (~0.6-0.65) scores, while others remain low. The overall assessment suggests moderate suspicion primarily driven by eval and obfuscation indicators, but no confirmed malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate security concerns. Scores should reflect suspicion levels, with higher malware (~0.6) and risk (~0.6-0.65) for reports indicating eval and obfuscation, and minimal scores for benign or absent code. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious packages.",
