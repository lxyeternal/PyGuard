  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate security concerns. Scores should reflect suspicion levels, with higher malware (~0.6) and risk (~0.6-0.65) for reports indicating eval and obfuscation, and minimal scores for benign or absent code. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious packages."
