  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Code input points such as data reading functions, environment variables, network connections, dynamic execution calls, and configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communication, file writes, system commands, or environment variable access that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs or external communications), especially involving dynamic code execution or insecure data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious network domains, or unusual code structures. Noted potential insecure practices but no confirmed malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack concrete code snippets, relying on high-level assessments. Reports 1, 2, 4, and 5 indicate benign, straightforward code with no suspicious patterns, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks. Report 3 notes potential insecure practices like dynamic execution and secrets, with a malware score of 0.1, obfuscation of 0.2, and security risk of 0.3, which are reasonable but could be slightly increased if actual code confirms such patterns. The confidence levels align with the available information, and no evidence suggests active malicious behavior. The overall assessment is that the code is safe, with minimal risk, and scores are consistent with the described observations.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign based on the provided reports, with no confirmed malicious activity or obfuscation. Minor potential risks noted in Report 3 could warrant slightly higher scores if code analysis confirms insecure practices. Overall, the dependency is considered safe for use.",
