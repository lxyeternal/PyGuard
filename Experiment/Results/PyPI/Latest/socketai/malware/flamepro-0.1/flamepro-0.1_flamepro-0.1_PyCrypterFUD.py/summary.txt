  "conclusion": "The script is a high-level obfuscation utility capable of hiding malicious payloads. It does not contain malicious code by itself but poses a significant security risk if misused. The high obfuscation and dynamic execution justify elevated security concern scores, though the malware score remains moderate as no malicious payloads are embedded in the provided code. Overall, treat this as a potentially dangerous obfuscation tool rather than malware per se."
