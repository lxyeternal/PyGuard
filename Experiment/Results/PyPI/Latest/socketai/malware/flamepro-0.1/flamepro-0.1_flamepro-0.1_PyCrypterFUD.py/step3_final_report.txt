  "purpose": "Obfuscate and encode arbitrary Python code through compression, base64 encoding, XOR encryption, embedding, and dynamic execution.",
  "sources": "Input file read at the start; code content loaded into 'codigo'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded code via exec(), which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Input file -> compression -> base64 encoding -> XOR encryption -> embedding in template -> decoding -> exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on dynamically decoded data; heavy obfuscation layers; hardcoded comments (# _skidder__).",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple obfuscation steps: compressing input, encoding, XOR encryption with a random key, embedding into a template, and executing via exec(). It does not contain malicious payloads by itself but provides a mechanism that can conceal malicious code. The use of exec() on untrusted data is a significant security risk. The obfuscation layers complicate static analysis, and the random key prevents straightforward detection. The code's intent appears to be code concealment, which can be exploited maliciously but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a high-level obfuscation utility capable of hiding malicious payloads. It does not contain malicious code by itself but poses a significant security risk if misused. The high obfuscation and dynamic execution justify elevated security concern scores, though the malware score remains moderate as no malicious payloads are embedded in the provided code. Overall, treat this as a potentially dangerous obfuscation tool rather than malware per se.",
