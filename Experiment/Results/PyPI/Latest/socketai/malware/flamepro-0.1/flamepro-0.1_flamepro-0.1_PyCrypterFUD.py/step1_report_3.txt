{
  "purpose": "The script obfuscates a given input Python code file by compressing, encoding, XOR encrypting, and embedding it into a generated Python script that, when executed, reconstructs and runs the original code.",
  "sources": "Reads input code from 'archivo_entrada' file, reads command-line arguments for input/output files and repetitions.",
  "sinks": "Generates a new Python script file containing obfuscated code, which executes the reconstructed original code via exec.",
  "flows": "Input file -> read code -> compress and encode -> XOR encrypt -> embed in template -> output script -> execute decoded code via exec.",
  "anomalies": "Use of XOR encryption with a randomly generated key at runtime, dynamic execution with exec, multiple obfuscation layers, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious network activity or file manipulations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads an input Python script, compresses and encodes it, applies XOR encryption with a randomly generated key, then embeds the encrypted data into a new script template that, upon execution, decrypts, decompresses, and runs the original code using exec. The obfuscation techniques employed (compression, base64, XOR, dynamic code execution) are typical of code protection or hiding mechanisms and do not inherently indicate malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of exec is potentially dangerous if misused, but here it reconstructs the original code, which is a common pattern in code obfuscation. Overall, the script appears to be a benign obfuscation utility rather than malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscation tool designed to conceal Python scripts through compression, encoding, XOR encryption, and dynamic execution. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or contain malicious payloads. The techniques used are common in code protection but should be used cautiously due to exec usage. No signs of malware or supply chain attacks are evident.",
