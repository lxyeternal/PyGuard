  "purpose": "Simple print statement outputting 'hello' with no external inputs or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward print statement with no inputs, dependencies, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's behavior. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code poses no threat and is safe for use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
