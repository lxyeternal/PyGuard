{
  "purpose": "Custom setup script that downloads and executes an external executable during installation.",
  "sources": "Download URL in subprocess command; the output file path determined by current working directory.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via Start-Process; potential code execution.",
  "flows": "Invoke-WebRequest download -> Save to local file -> Start-Process to execute the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and immediately executing an external executable during setup without validation; use of PowerShell commands within a setup script; no validation or integrity check of downloaded file.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard installation process to download an executable from a suspicious GitHub URL. It then attempts to open and run the downloaded file immediately after download. This behavior can be malicious, as it could run arbitrary code without user consent. The use of PowerShell commands and direct execution indicates potentially malicious intent, especially since it downloads from an external source and executes without validation. The code does not include any checks for integrity, signature, or user consent, raising serious security concerns. Overall, the script appears designed to perform malicious or unwanted activity during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation without validation, indicating high malicious potential. It is strongly advised not to use this package.",
