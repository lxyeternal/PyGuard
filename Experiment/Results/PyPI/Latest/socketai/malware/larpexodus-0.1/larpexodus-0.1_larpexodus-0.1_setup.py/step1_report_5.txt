{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes a remote executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the internet via PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest; it also reads and accesses the current working directory and file system.",
  "sinks": "It opens the downloaded executable file using PowerShell's Start-Process, which executes the file locally.",
  "flows": "Download URL -> Save to current directory -> Execute the downloaded file",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of package installation to download and run an external executable, potential for malicious activity. Hardcoded URL pointing to an external resource; executing downloaded code without verification.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to include additional steps. It constructs a PowerShell command to download a file from a specified URL and saves it as 'CBLines.exe'. It then checks if the download succeeded and attempts to open/run the executable via PowerShell. The process involves executing external commands that can run arbitrary code. The URL points to a remote executable, which is downloaded and executed without validation or user consent, typical of malicious behavior. No benign or necessary functionality justifies such behavior during package installation. The code does not perform any sanitization, verification, or sandboxing of the downloaded file, increasing security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits potentially malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation without validation, which is characteristic of supply chain attacks or malware. This is highly suspicious and should be considered unsafe.",
