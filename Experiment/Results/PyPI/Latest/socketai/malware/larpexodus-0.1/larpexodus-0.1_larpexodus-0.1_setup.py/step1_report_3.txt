{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process to download and execute an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the network via PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest to download a file from a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the downloaded file using PowerShell's Start-Process, which can run the executable without user consent.",
  "flows": "The source (network download) leads to the sink (execution of downloaded file), potentially executing malicious code obtained from the internet.",
  "anomalies": "The script downloads and executes an executable file from an external URL during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious. The URL points to a potentially malicious file. The code does not validate or verify the integrity of the downloaded file. The use of PowerShell commands embedded within Python code for silent download and execution is indicative of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard install command to run custom commands during package installation. It downloads an executable from an external URL using PowerShell, then attempts to run it immediately. This behavior resembles malicious activity such as downloading and executing malware without user awareness. The download URL is external and not verified, and executing arbitrary downloaded files poses a significant security risk. There are no safeguards like checksum validation, user prompts, or sandboxing. Overall, this behavior is consistent with malicious supply chain activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation without user consent or validation. This indicates high potential for malware distribution and supply chain compromise.",
