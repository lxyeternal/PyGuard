{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to download and execute a remote executable file during setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current working directory for saving the downloaded file; it retrieves a file from a remote URL via PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file using Start-Process; potentially runs arbitrary code from the remote source.",
  "flows": "Download file from remote URL -> Save to current directory -> Open the file with Start-Process, executing it.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable directly from a GitHub URL and executes it without any verification or user consent. It does not check the contents or signature of the file before execution. The approach of executing downloaded files during setup is suspicious. No validation, logging, or user notification is present.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard installation process by adding a step that downloads an executable from an external source. It then attempts to run this executable immediately after download. This behavior could be malicious, as it allows remote code execution during package installation. The code uses PowerShell commands with shell=True, increasing risk of command injection if input is manipulated, although in this static code the URL appears fixed. The code does not verify the integrity or authenticity of the downloaded file. The overall pattern resembles malicious behavior aimed at executing remote code without user consent, typical of supply chain attacks or malware distribution. No obfuscation or benign functionality is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code downloads and executes an external executable during setup without verification, indicating malicious intent. It bypasses typical security measures, making it highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
