{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup installation process that downloads and executes an external executable file during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/output data from the system environment, runs subprocess commands to download and execute files, and accesses the current working directory.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'Start-Process' on the downloaded file, which could launch potentially malicious executable without user consent.",
  "flows": "Download command retrieves the executable from an external URL, then the open command launches it, both triggered during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from a remote URL during setup and immediately executes it without validation, which is suspicious. The URL points to a raw GitHub content, which may be malicious. No validation or checksum is performed before execution. No user consent or warning is provided. The setup script overrides the default installation behavior to include this potentially malicious step.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the installation process to include a PowerShell command that downloads an executable ('CBLines.exe') from an external URL during installation. If the download succeeds, it launches the executable immediately. This behavior is highly suspicious because it can execute arbitrary code from the internet during package installation, which is a common technique for malware distribution. There are no checksums, validation, or user prompts before execution. The code could be used to silently install malware or backdoors on the target system.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation, which can be exploited to deliver malware or unwanted software. This behavior poses a significant security risk.",
