{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable from a remote URL during installation and immediately executes it without validation, indicating malicious intent and potential supply chain attack behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the hardcoded URL in the subprocess command and the current working directory for saving the file.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run calls execute PowerShell commands that run the downloaded executable, leading to potential remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Source: URL in the download command -> Downloaded file saved to current directory -> Executed via Start-Process in subprocess call.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate execution of a remote file without validation, no checksum or signature verification, and use of PowerShell commands embedded in Python code.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to download an executable from a GitHub URL using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest, saves it locally, and then executes it via Start-Process. This behavior occurs during package installation, with no validation or user consent, representing a high security risk. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the malicious pattern is clear. The high malware score (1.0) and security risk score (1.0) are justified due to the potential for arbitrary code execution and system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during setup without validation, posing a severe security threat. The scores assigned are appropriate and reflect the high risk involved.",
