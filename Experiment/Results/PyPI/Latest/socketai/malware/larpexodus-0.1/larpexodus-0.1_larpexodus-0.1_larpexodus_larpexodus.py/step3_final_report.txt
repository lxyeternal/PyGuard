  "purpose": "A simple Python script that outputs 'hello' to the console.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to files, send data over network, or access sensitive resources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with no obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic print statement with no inputs, external dependencies, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, posing no security threat or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as non-malicious and low risk. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
