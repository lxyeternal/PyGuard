  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that imports standard modules and performs basic operations, but lacks clear documentation or specific functionality indicating its purpose.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the environment variables, standard input, or function parameters (if any).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file system operations, or subprocess calls if present, but none are evident from the provided code.",
  "flows": "Input from environment or user is processed through functions or operations and possibly output or sent elsewhere, but specific flows cannot be confirmed without code details.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features are detected in the visible code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and does not contain complex logic, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, seems benign. Without additional context or code segments, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no signs of malware, suspicious data flows, or obfuscation. However, the lack of detail limits absolute certainty.",
