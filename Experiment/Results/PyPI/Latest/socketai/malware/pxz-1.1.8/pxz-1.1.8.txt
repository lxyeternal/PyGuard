      "conclusion": "The code exhibits privacy-invasive behavior by collecting and transmitting system information during installation without user consent. While it does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation, its activity is suspicious and potentially malicious in a privacy context. The malware score should be moderate, reflecting the exfiltration activity, and the security risk score should be high due to covert data transmission."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with moderate malicious intent, primarily due to eval usage, obfuscation, and network activity. While no definitive malicious payload is identified, the risk profile warrants caution. The malware score is set at 0.5, obfuscation at 0.5, and security risk at 0.6, reflecting these concerns."
