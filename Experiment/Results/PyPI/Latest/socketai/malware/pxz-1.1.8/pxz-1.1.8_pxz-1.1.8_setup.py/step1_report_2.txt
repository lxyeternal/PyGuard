{
  "purpose": "Collects and sends system information (public IP, hostname, directories, current time) to a specified server upon package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname, current directory, user home directory, and current time; fetching public IP via URL; sending data via HTTP request to remote server.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to remote server with system info embedded in URL parameters.",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() gathers data -> encodes data into URL -> sends GET request to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The function is invoked during package setup via an entry point, which is unusual and may execute code at install time. The server URL is hardcoded and points to an external IP. Data collection includes public IP and hostname, which could be used for tracking. No authentication or encryption is used for data transmission, potentially exposing info. The code performs network activity during install, which is suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system info such as public IP, hostname, directories, and current time. It then constructs a URL with these parameters and sends a GET request to an external IP address. This activity occurs during package installation via a console script entry point, which could be used to exfiltrate user data without explicit consent. The server URL is hardcoded, and there are no security measures like encryption or authentication. The behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking, especially since it occurs silently at install time. No malicious payloads like malware, backdoors, or destructive actions are present, but the data collection and transmission are privacy-invading and could be malicious depending on user consent and context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data collection and transmission during package installation without user notification, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration. No direct malicious payloads are evident, but the behavior is suspicious and could violate user privacy expectations.",
