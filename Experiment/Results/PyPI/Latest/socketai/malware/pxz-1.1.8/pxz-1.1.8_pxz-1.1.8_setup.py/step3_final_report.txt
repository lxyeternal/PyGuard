{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (public IP, hostname, directories, current time) and transmits it to an external server during package installation, likely for tracking or exfiltration purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current working directory, home directory, public IP via URL request, and current timestamp.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address during the execution of the on_install() function triggered at setup.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system calls and URL requests, then concatenated into URL parameters and transmitted over the network during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic data collection and transmission during package install without user consent, hardcoded server URL, no obfuscation, no credentials or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward system info collection and sends it externally during setup, which is unusual and privacy-invasive. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The network activity during install is suspicious but not definitively malicious. The behavior resembles covert data exfiltration or tracking, raising privacy concerns. The code's clarity and lack of obfuscation are noted. The network request to a fixed IP during install is a security concern, but no malicious payloads or backdoors are detected. The scores should reflect privacy invasion rather than outright malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits privacy-invasive behavior by collecting and transmitting system information during installation without user consent. While it does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation, its activity is suspicious and potentially malicious in a privacy context. The malware score should be moderate, reflecting the exfiltration activity, and the security risk score should be high due to covert data transmission.",
