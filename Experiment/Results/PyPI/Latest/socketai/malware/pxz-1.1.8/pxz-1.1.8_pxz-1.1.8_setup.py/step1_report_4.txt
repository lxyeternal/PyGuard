{
  "purpose": "Collects and sends system information to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads public IP via URL request, gets hostname, home directory, current directory, and current time.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP GET request to a specified server URL.",
  "flows": "Source data (IP, hostname, directories, time) is assembled into URL parameters and sent via a GET request to the remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically collects detailed system info and transmits it during installation, which is unusual for typical package setup scripts. The server URL is hardcoded with an IP address. The collection and transmission occur in the 'on_install' hook, potentially without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system data such as public IP, hostname, and directories, then transmits this information to an external IP address during package installation, which is suspicious behavior. The data transmission is embedded directly into the setup script via an 'entry_point' that triggers during installation, implying possible privacy invasion or malicious tracking. There are no indications of obfuscation or malicious code execution beyond data exfiltration. The hardcoded server URL and automatic data send without user awareness are red flags. This behavior aligns with covert data collection, potentially malicious, depending on user intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system data collection and exfiltration during package installation, which is suspicious and could be malicious depending on context. It does not contain obfuscated code or direct malware payloads but exhibits malicious-like behavior through covert data transmission.",
