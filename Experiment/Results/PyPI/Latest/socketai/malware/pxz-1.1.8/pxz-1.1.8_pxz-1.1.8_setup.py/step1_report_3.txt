{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to collect system information and send it to a specified remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the network (public IP via URL), system environment (hostname, directories), and current time.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via an HTTP GET request to a remote server, which could potentially be malicious or used for tracking.",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() gathers system info -> encodes it into URL parameters -> sends it via urlopen to the specified server.",
  "anomalies": "Automatically sends system information to an external IP during installation without user consent; no clear purpose for this data transmission is documented.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to collect system info, including public IP, hostname, directories, and current time. It constructs a URL with these parameters and makes an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded IP address. This occurs during package installation via an entry point. Such behavior resembles tracking or potentially malicious data exfiltration, especially since it occurs without user notification or explicit consent. No obfuscated code or malicious code patterns are present, but the automatic network transmission raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform unauthorized collection and transmission of system information during package installation, which can be considered malicious behavior or privacy-invasive tracking. It lacks transparency and user consent, posing a security risk.",
