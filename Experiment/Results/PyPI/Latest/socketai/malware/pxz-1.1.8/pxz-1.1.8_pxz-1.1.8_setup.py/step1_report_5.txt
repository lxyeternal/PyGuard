{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information (public IP, hostname, directories, current time) and send it to a remote server upon package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads system info from os.uname(), os.path.expanduser(), os.getcwd(), and makes HTTP requests to external URLs (https://api.ipify.org and http://35.170.187.220:8080/).",
  "sinks": "The URL request to the remote server with system info as URL parameters potentially leaks data externally. Print statements for success/failure are benign and do not leak sensitive info to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "System info collected from OS and datetime functions flows into URL parameters, which are sent via a GET request to the specified server URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically sends system information to an external IP address without user consent. The URL is hardcoded, and the data collection is triggered during package installation via a custom entry point, which is unusual for benign packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for HTTP requests, OS info, and datetime. It defines a function to collect system info, which includes obtaining the public IP without relying on curl, collecting hostname, directories, and current time. It then constructs a URL with this info and sends a GET request to a specified IP address. The request is executed during package installation through an entry point. No input validation, authentication, or encryption is used. The data exfiltration happens automatically during installation, which could be malicious if used without user knowledge. No other malicious code or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code secretly collects and transmits system information to an external server during package installation without user awareness. The behavior resembles a data exfiltration or surveillance activity, which is suspicious. The code is not obfuscated, but its behavior is potentially malicious due to unauthorized data transmission.",
