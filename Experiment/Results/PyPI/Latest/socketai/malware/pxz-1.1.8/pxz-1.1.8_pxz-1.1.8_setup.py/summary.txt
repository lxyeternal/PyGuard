  "conclusion": "The code exhibits privacy-invasive behavior by collecting and transmitting system information during installation without user consent. While it does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation, its activity is suspicious and potentially malicious in a privacy context. The malware score should be moderate, reflecting the exfiltration activity, and the security risk score should be high due to covert data transmission."
