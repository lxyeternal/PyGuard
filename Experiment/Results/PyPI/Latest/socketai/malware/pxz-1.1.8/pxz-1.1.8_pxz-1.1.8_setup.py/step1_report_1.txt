{
  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname, current working directory, home directory, public IP via URL request, and current timestamp.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to a remote server with system data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() gathers system info -> encodes as URL parameters -> sends GET request to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes automatic transmission of system data to an external server during installation, which could be used for tracking or data exfiltration. No explicit hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and network modules, then defines a function to gather system information such as public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, and timestamp. It constructs a URL with this data and sends a GET request to a specified IP address. The function is called during package installation via an entry point. While technically not malicious code, this behavior can be used for tracking or surveillance without user consent. No malicious code, backdoors, or hidden functionalities are explicitly present. The data exfiltration behavior is suspicious but not inherently malicious without further context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and transmits it to a remote server upon installation. While not malicious in intent, this behavior is potentially privacy-invading and could be exploited for malicious purposes. It warrants review for user transparency and consent. No malware, obfuscation, or hardcoded credentials detected.",
