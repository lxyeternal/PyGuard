  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'tronyx' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data is being executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reading file content (README.md) then passing static package information to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup script with no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for package setup, reads the README file content, and configures package metadata including dependencies, author info, and repository URL. All operations are standard for Python package distribution and do not involve any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no obfuscated elements, no code injection, no network activity, and no sensitive data handling beyond public metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python setup script for packaging. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
