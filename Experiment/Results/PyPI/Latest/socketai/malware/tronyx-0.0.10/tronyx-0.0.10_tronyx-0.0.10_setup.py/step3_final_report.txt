  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for distributing the 'tronyx' library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, static metadata in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulation",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "Comment '#Add a comma here' is minor but not suspicious; no obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script that imports standard modules, reads a README file, and calls setup() with static metadata. No dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, securityRisk: 0.0) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's simplicity and transparency justify the low risk and malware scores. All reports correctly interpret the code as safe, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified, reflecting the code's harmless nature.",
