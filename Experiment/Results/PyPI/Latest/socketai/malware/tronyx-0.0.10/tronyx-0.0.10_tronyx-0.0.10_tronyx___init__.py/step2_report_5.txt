  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically.\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is a simple import statement: `from .main import perm`.\n   - There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues solely from this import statement.\n   - The code is minimal and typical in Python package structures.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the lack of data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - Security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1), which is reasonable for a simple import.\n   - Confidence levels vary from 0.3 to 1.0; higher confidence aligns with the straightforwardness of the code.\n   - Obfuscated scores are all 0, which is correct.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - The highest confidence (1.0) is assigned when the code is clearly benign, so no adjustments needed.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0.\n   - Since the code is just an import statement with no suspicious behavior, this is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code snippet alone.\n   - They acknowledge that without additional context, malicious intent cannot be determined.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The minimal code justifies low security risk and malware scores.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code snippet is benign.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just a standard import)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a straightforward import statement with no security concerns. The reports are correct, and the scores are appropriate.",
