  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Actual Risks**:\n   - All reports are about a simple import statement: `from .main import perm`.\n   - The code snippet is minimal, with no data flow, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns.\n   - There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities directly stemming from this line.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n   - The majority of reports (reports 2, 3, 4, 5) assign a **malware score of 0**, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1.0), indicating that the reviewers agree on the benign assessment.\n   - The reports correctly identify that, in isolation, this import statement is not malicious or risky.\n\n3. **Potential Flaws or Logical Errors in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and cautious, emphasizing the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n   - No report claims any malicious activity or security flaw based solely on this snippet.\n   - The mention of potential malicious intent is appropriately dismissed due to lack of evidence.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification**:\n   - The **malware scores** are all 0, which is justified given the code.\n   - The **securityRisk** scores are low (mostly 0.1), which seems reasonable for such a simple import statement.\n   - The **obfuscated** scores are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - Based on the code snippet and the reports, there is no reason to assign higher malware or security risk scores.\n   - The code appears benign, and the assessments are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 — minimal risk, typical for import statements in codebases.\n\n### Summary:\nThis import statement, in isolation, is benign. Without additional context or usage, it cannot be considered malicious or risky. The reports' scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the broader context of how this import is used in the larger codebase. If the `main` module or `perm` function is compromised or malicious, that would be outside the scope of this snippet. But based solely on this code, the risk is negligible.",
