  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly shown in this single-line import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with standard import; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a simple relative import of 'perm' from a local module 'main'. It does not include any data handling, user input, or execution of untrusted code. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward import statement, typical in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and likely part of a larger project.",
