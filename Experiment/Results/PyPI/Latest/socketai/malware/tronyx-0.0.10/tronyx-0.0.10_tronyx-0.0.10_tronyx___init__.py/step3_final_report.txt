  "purpose": "Minimal import statement for a local module, likely part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package: 'from .main import perm'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; the code only performs a static import.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond the import statement; no source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of 'perm' from the 'main' module within the same package. It is syntactically correct, standard in Python projects, and shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The minimal nature of the code and the absence of data flows, network activity, or dynamic execution indicate a benign intent. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, high confidence levels, and low security risk scores, consistent with the benign assessment. No anomalies or suspicious features are present. Given the context, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
