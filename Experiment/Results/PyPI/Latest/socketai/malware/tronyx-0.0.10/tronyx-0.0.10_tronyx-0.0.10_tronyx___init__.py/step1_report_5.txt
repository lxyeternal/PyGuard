  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'perm' from a local module 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flow identified; just an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only a single import statement with relative import syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import from the local 'main' module, importing 'perm'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. It does not read external input, nor does it perform any operations beyond importing a component. The minimal nature of the code indicates no suspicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or anomalies are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a part of a larger project, and on its own, it presents no security risks.",
