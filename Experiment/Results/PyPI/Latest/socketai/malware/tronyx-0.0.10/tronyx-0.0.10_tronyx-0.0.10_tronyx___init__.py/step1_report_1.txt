  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or sensitive operations in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from a single import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, consisting only of an import statement; no anomalies detected in isolation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import from a relative module. Without additional context or usage, there are no indications of malicious intent. The import could be part of legitimate functionality, or potentially used maliciously if the 'main' module is compromised, but this cannot be determined from this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious behavior or security issues. Insufficient information exists to identify any security risks or malware. The code appears benign based solely on this snippet.",
