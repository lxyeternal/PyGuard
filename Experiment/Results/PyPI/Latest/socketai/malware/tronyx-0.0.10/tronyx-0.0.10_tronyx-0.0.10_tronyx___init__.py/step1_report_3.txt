  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'main' module within the same package/directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present in this line.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; this is a simple import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is a straightforward relative import. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import of 'perm' from the 'main' module. It does not contain any logic, data handling, or dynamic execution that could indicate malicious activity. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated elements, or external network calls. The import statement is typical in Python package structures and poses no security threat on its own.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
