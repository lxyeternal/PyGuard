  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal import statement: `from .main import perm`.\n- None of the reports identify any direct malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0), reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, indicating no malicious intent detected.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0.1), which is reasonable given the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness:**\n   - The code is present and syntactically correct.\n   - It performs a straightforward relative import, which is common in Python projects.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the import statement.\n   - The reports correctly identify the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The security risk scores are low (0.1), which seems appropriate for such a simple import statement.\n   - The confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk.\n   - The code is purely an import, with no data flow, network activity, or code execution.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain low.\n\n5. **Malware considerations:**\n   - Since the code only imports a symbol from a local module, there's no indication of malicious activity.\n   - The reports correctly assign malware scores of 0.\n\n6. **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis is appropriate.\n   - Importing a local module is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The slight variation in confidence scores (some 0.9, some 1.0) is acceptable, reflecting minor differences in certainty.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the uniformity and the analysis, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify that this import statement is benign. No adjustments to scores are necessary. The code snippet is standard, with no malicious or suspicious characteristics.",
