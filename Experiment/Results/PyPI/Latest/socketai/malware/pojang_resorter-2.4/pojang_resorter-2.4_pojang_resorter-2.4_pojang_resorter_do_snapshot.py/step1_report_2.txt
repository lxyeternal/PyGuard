{
  "purpose": "Decompresses and executes base64-encoded, reversed data, likely to run hidden or obfuscated code.",
  "sources": "Input data is the base64-encoded string passed to the lambda function, which is reversed before decoding.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executes the decompressed and decoded data, which could be malicious code.",
  "flows": "The reversed base64 data is decoded, then decompressed, and finally executed via exec(), creating a source-to-sink flow from input data to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Uses an unusual lambda function for deobfuscation; reverses the string, decodes from base64, then decompresses with zlib; the data appears heavily obfuscated; no clear purpose for such manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that imports 'zlib' and 'base64' to process input data. The data is reversed, base64-decoded, and then decompressed before being executed. The input data appears to be heavily obfuscated, suggesting intent to hide malicious payloads. The direct use of exec() on decompressed data is a significant security concern, as it can execute arbitrary code. The obfuscation and reliance on decompression/decoding strongly imply malicious intent, possibly to hide malicious code from static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs heavy obfuscation to conceal executable content and directly executes it, which is a classic pattern for malicious payloads. Given the decoding, decompression, and execution flow, this is highly suspicious and indicates malicious behavior.",
