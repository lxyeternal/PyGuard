  "purpose": "Decompress and execute obfuscated payload embedded as a base64-encoded, reversed string.",
  "sources": "The string passed to the lambda function, which is a large base64-encoded, reversed byte string.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executing the decompressed code, which is likely malicious payload.",
  "flows": "The code reverses the string, decodes it from base64, decompresses it with zlib, then executes the result.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda for obfuscation, reversing the string before decoding, and immediate execution via exec(). The payload is heavily obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that reverses its input, decodes from base64, and decompresses using zlib. It then calls exec() on the decompressed payload. The payload itself is a large base64 string that is reversed, indicating intentional obfuscation. The immediate execution of dynamically decompressed code is a common tactic in malicious scripts to hide behavior. No external inputs or user data are read; all data is embedded within the script. The obfuscation and use of exec() suggest malicious intent, as this pattern is typical in malware delivery or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious. It decrypts and executes a large, obfuscated payload, which is indicative of malicious behavior, likely a backdoor or malware payload. The obfuscation and immediate execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
