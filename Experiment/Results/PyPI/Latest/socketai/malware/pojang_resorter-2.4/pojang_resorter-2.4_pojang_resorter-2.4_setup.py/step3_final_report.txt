{
  "purpose": "Static setup configuration for the 'pojang_resorter' package, including dependencies and embedded binary.",
  "sources": "Package data 'libs/windows.exe' included in the setup; dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; potential concern if 'libs/windows.exe' is malicious or misused post-installation.",
  "flows": "No dynamic code execution; data flows from package data to potential runtime use if executable is invoked.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe' as package data is unusual and suspicious; no active malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The setup script is static and standard, with no code execution or obfuscation. The main concern is the embedded 'libs/windows.exe', which could be benign or malicious. Malware scores are low (0.2), reflecting suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. Security risk scores are moderate (~0.3-0.4), considering the potential misuse of the embedded binary and dependencies. Further binary analysis of 'libs/windows.exe' is necessary to determine its safety. The code itself does not contain vulnerabilities or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The setup code is benign and standard; the primary concern is the embedded 'libs/windows.exe', which requires external inspection. Current malware and risk scores are appropriate given the static analysis, but caution is advised until the binary's purpose is verified.",
