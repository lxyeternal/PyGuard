  "purpose": "A command-line interface tool that executes various server-related scripts and functions based on user input, including importing and running external scripts and modules.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments ('command' and 'extra_args'), filesystem to locate script files, and dynamically imports specific functions from external modules.",
  "sinks": "Executes subprocess commands to run other Python scripts, potentially allowing execution of arbitrary code if command input is manipulated, and imports functions which could potentially be exploited if external modules are malicious.",
  "flows": "User input ('command') influences which script or function is executed. For 'initialize_server', 'preview_server', and 'display_help', corresponding scripts are run via subprocess. For 'assign_operator' and 'nukeserver', internal functions from external modules are called. Additional arguments are passed into these scripts or functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports external modules and runs scripts based on user input, which can be exploited if input is not properly validated or if external modules are malicious. The use of subprocess to run scripts can be risky if scripts or command arguments are tampered with. No validation of script existence beyond filename check. No sanitization of command arguments is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging and provides a command-line interface to trigger various scripts and functions. It maps commands to specific scripts or imported functions. The use of 'subprocess.run' with user-supplied arguments, without validation or sanitization, introduces risk if malicious input is provided. Dynamic imports from external modules ('pojag_resorter.forceop' and 'pojag_resorter.nukeserver') could be exploited if these modules contain malicious code. There are no evident protections against command injection or malicious argument passing. Overall, the code depends heavily on external scripts and modules, with minimal input validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits potential security risks primarily due to dynamic execution of scripts and functions based on user input, with insufficient validation. The ability to run arbitrary scripts via subprocess and import external modules opens avenues for malicious exploitation if inputs are manipulated or if external modules are compromised. While no direct malware signatures are evident, the design pattern of executing external code based on user input warrants caution. The overall security risk is moderate to high depending on trust in external modules and input validation.",
