  "purpose": "Obfuscated code that decompresses and executes a hidden payload",
  "sources": "Input data is from the embedded base64 string, which is reversed, then decoded and decompressed",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decompressed code via exec() function, which could run arbitrary code",
  "flows": "Base64 string reversed -> decoded -> decompressed -> executed via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda function with obfuscation, reversing string, base64 decoding, decompression, and dynamic execution; no clear legitimate purpose",
  "analysis": "The code defines an anonymous lambda function that imports 'zlib' and 'base64' modules for decompression and decoding. It takes a long base64-encoded string, reverses it, decodes, and decompresses it before executing the result via exec(). This pattern is typical for obfuscated, potentially malicious scripts that hide malicious payloads. The use of dynamic execution, especially with compressed and encoded data, is a common tactic to evade static analysis. No benign or explicit purpose is evident. The code’s structure suggests it is designed to hide malicious behavior or payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and executes a payload that is encoded and compressed, indicating malicious intent. The dynamic execution of decompressed code, with no visible benign purpose, strongly suggests this is malicious malware designed to hide its true intent.",
