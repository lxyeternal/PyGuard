  "purpose": "Package initialization for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, providing metadata and importing the main function.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .main import main' and metadata assignments (__version__, __author__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external communications, or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import from local module 'main' without dynamic execution; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic behaviors; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package setup script with no inputs, outputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's content. No vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are evident. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring appropriately reflects the code's safety. No further action or concern is warranted.",
