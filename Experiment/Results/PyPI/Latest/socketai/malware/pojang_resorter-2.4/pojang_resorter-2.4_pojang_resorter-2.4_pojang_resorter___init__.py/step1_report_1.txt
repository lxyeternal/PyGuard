{
  "purpose": "Provides core functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, mainly by importing the main module.",
  "sources": "Imports main from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data leaks or malicious output points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only imports a module and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution, backdoors, or credential handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and only defines package metadata and imports a main function. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. It does not include any obfuscated code, network activity, or potentially malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily sets metadata and imports a core function for the CLI tool.",
