{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, mainly importing main function and setting metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module, module-level metadata assignments (__version__, __author__)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code merely sets metadata and imports a function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports a main function from a relative module and sets version and author metadata. There are no input sources, external data handling, or executable code that could be malicious. The simplicity suggests it is a standard package entry point or module setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning solely as a module setup with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
