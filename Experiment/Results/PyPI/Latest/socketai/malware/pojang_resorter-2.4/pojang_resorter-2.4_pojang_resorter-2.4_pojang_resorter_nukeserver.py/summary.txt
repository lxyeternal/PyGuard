  "conclusion": "The code itself is not malicious but acts as a launcher for an external executable, which poses a security risk if the binary is malicious or tampered with. The main concern is the absence of validation or integrity checks before execution. Scores should reflect a moderate risk level with low malware potential, emphasizing the importance of verifying external binaries before execution."
