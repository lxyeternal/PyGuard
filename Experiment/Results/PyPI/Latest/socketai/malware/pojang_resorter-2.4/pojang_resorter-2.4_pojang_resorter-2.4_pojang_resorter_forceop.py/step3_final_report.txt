  "purpose": "Assign operator privileges to a user on a Minecraft server via RCON.",
  "sources": "User inputs for username, server IP, RCON port, RCON password; the command string constructed for 'op' execution.",
  "sinks": "The command sent to the Minecraft server via mcrcon, which executes the 'op' command with the provided username.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> command string f\"op {username}\" -> mcrcon command execution on server.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of input sanitization for username, potential for command injection if malicious input is provided.",
  "analysis": "The code connects to a Minecraft server using user-provided credentials and executes an 'op' command for the specified username. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. The primary security concern is that the username input is directly embedded into the command string without validation, which could lead to command injection if inputs are maliciously crafted. The script's overall behavior is legitimate for server administration. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward. The security risk score is approximately 0.3, reflecting the potential for command injection due to lack of input sanitization, but no actual malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard utility for assigning operator privileges on a Minecraft server. It is not malicious but carries a moderate security risk if inputs are not trusted or sanitized. To improve security, input validation should be added to prevent command injection. The current scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3.",
