  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface with help message and ASCII art for a Python-Mojang interaction tool.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments using argparse.",
  "sinks": "Outputs ASCII art and help text to the console; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments flow from argparse parsing to conditional execution, primarily for displaying help.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors; the ASCII art and help display are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a function to show help with ASCII art and command descriptions, and processes command-line arguments to display help info. No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or sinks are involved beyond standard argument parsing and printing. The code appears to be a benign CLI help utility with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI help display with colored ASCII art. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this module.",
