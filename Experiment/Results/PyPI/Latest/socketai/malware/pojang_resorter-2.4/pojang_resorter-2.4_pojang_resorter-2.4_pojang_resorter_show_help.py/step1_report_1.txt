{
  "purpose": "To provide a CLI tool for displaying help information and command options for a Python-based application.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line arguments via argparse.",
  "sinks": "Display output to the console (stdout); no external data sinks, network activity, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line arguments) flows into argparse parsing, which determines the displayed help and ASCII art; no further data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None detected. The code uses standard libraries and practices for CLI help display. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a function to display ASCII art with command descriptions, and invokes this function when run directly. The code leverages argparse for command parsing, but the commands are only for display purposes and do not perform any actions or system modifications. There are no suspicious data flows, external network activity, or potentially malicious constructs. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or complex logic. It appears to be a benign CLI help utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI help display script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply shows ASCII art and command descriptions, with no data leakage, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
