  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** No issues detected; code is a benign CLI help utility displaying ASCII art and command descriptions.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; straightforward help display with no external data handling or malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Also a benign CLI help utility, no suspicious code, no external data, no command execution beyond printing help.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same benign behavior, ASCII art, command descriptions, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous; no malicious or suspicious behavior, just a help display.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code Presence:** The code is purely a static CLI help display with ASCII art and command descriptions.  \n- **Malware, Obfuscation, Security Risks:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.  \n- **Score Justification:** All scores are set to zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's behavior.  \n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports.  \n- No adjustments needed based on the current analysis.  \n- Given the benign nature, I would assign an overall **malware score of 0**, **obfuscated score of 0**, and **risk score of 0**.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, benign CLI help utility with ASCII art and command descriptions. It does not perform any malicious activities, data leaks, or obfuscation. The current scores accurately reflect its safety profile.",
