  "purpose": "Provide a CLI tool with ASCII art and command help messages for managing a Minecraft server interaction.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine user commands.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line arguments) parsed by argparse, leading to help message display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The ASCII art is purely aesthetic. No external network connections or data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama for terminal color formatting, then defines a function to display ASCII art and command help info with colored formatting. It uses argparse to define four subcommands. The code outputs formatted ASCII art and help information when executed. There are no data injections, malicious network calls, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a benign CLI help utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious CLI help utility that displays ASCII art and command descriptions. There are no indicators of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
