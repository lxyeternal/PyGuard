{
  "purpose": "Provides a CLI tool with ASCII art and command descriptions for managing a Minecraft server or similar system.",
  "sources": "argparse for command-line arguments; colorama for terminal coloring.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions or imports directly handle untrusted data or user input in a way that leads to data leaks or command execution.",
  "flows": "The code initializes the terminal UI, displays ASCII art, and outputs help messages based on command-line arguments. There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The ASCII art and help display do not contain malicious content or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily initializes colorized terminal output and displays help messages with predefined commands. It does not process or execute any user input beyond argument parsing, which is limited to printing help. No external data is read, and no commands are executed based on user input. The code does not perform any operations that could lead to code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help display script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It functions solely to present ASCII art and command descriptions. No malware or security vulnerabilities are identified.",
