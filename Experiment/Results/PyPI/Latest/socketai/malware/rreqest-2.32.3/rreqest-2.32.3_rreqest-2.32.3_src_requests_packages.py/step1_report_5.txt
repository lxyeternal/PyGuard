{
  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by aliasing certain third-party modules within the package namespace.",
  "sources": "The code reads the modules 'urllib3', 'idna', and optionally 'chardet' from the environment or existing sys.modules.",
  "sinks": "Modifying sys.modules to create aliases under 'requests.packages.*', which affects module import behavior within the runtime environment.",
  "flows": "Modules are imported or checked in sys.modules, then sys.modules entries are overwritten to create aliases under 'requests.packages.*'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. The code performs dynamic import and sys.modules manipulation but does not execute untrusted code or send data externally.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module aliasing for compatibility, re-mapping existing modules into a nested namespace to mimic an older structure. This involves importing modules, checking sys.modules, and creating new references within sys.modules. It does not involve any network activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The code's purpose appears purely structural, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for backward compatibility, remapping modules within sys.modules. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided snippet. It appears safe and not malicious.",
