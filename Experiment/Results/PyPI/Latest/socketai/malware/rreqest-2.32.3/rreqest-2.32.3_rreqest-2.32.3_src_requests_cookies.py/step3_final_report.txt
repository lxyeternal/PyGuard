  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for managing HTTP cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, creation, and management routines.",
  "sources": "Reading request URL, headers, and cookie data; handling cookie objects and cookie jars.",
  "sinks": "Potential injection points if untrusted data is used to create or modify cookies, but no actual sink behaviors like network transmission or file writing are present.",
  "flows": "Input data from request headers or cookie dicts flows into cookie creation or modification functions; cookies are stored or retrieved from cookie jars; no external network or system modifications occur.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected; standard cookie management routines.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard, well-structured utility functions for cookie handling, including extraction, creation, and management of cookies and cookie jars. It does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or contain obfuscated code. The functions handle inputs and outputs securely, with no signs of malicious intent. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores of zero are appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, utility-focused module for cookie management, with no malicious or sabotage indicators. The scores across reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
