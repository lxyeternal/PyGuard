  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's functionality, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions/classes for cookie management, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — aligns with the code's purpose.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, considering no vulnerabilities.\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The functions are typical for cookie handling, and no external network activity or hidden behaviors are present.\n- **Verdict:** The scoring appears reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Compatibility utilities for cookie handling, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — still low, as the code handles cookies securely.\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly notes that the code performs standard cookie management tasks, with no signs of malicious activity. The functions are straightforward, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Compatibility utilities, standard cookie handling, no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — matches the code's benign nature.\n- **Security risk:** 0.0 — minimal, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- **Analysis:** The report emphasizes the absence of obfuscation, network activity, or data exfiltration. The code's purpose is clear and standard.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for cookie management, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low.\n- **Analysis:** The report confirms that the code is standard, with no suspicious behaviors. Thread safety measures are standard, and no external communications are involved.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard cookie management utilities, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — matches the code's purpose.\n- **Security risk:** 0.0 — no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n- **Analysis:** The report rightly states that the code is typical for cookie handling, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code being straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions/classes for cookie handling within the requests library.\n- No external network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The functions perform standard, well-understood tasks.\n- The scoring aligns with the code's functionality and observed behaviors.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to the potential for misuse if untrusted data is fed into cookie creation or management, but this is standard for cookie handling code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are appropriate and justified based on the code review. No adjustments necessary.",
