  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for handling cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, setting, and management.",
  "sources": "Requests request object (request), response headers (response), and external cookie data structures (cookiejar, cookies).",
  "sinks": "Cookie header generation, cookie extraction into jars, cookie modification/removal, and serialization (pickling).",
  "flows": "Request data is used to generate cookie headers; response headers are parsed to extract cookies; cookies are stored/modified in cookie jars; cookie data can be serialized/deserialized.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code detected; functions perform standard cookie management tasks. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard compatibility wrappers and cookie management functions for the requests library, including classes for mock requests/responses, cookie extraction, and a CookieJar with dict-like interface. It carefully handles cookie creation, merging, and removal. No obfuscated code, external network connections, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be straightforward and intended for managing cookies securely within the context of HTTP requests.",
  "conclusion": "This module offers utility functions and classes for cookie management in the requests library without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It is well-structured for its purpose, with no suspicious or harmful behavior observed.",
