  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for any signs of malicious activity, and evaluate the appropriateness of the given scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is utility functions for cookie management, with no suspicious or malicious code detected. It emphasizes the straightforward, compatibility-focused nature of the code.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is primarily utility functions and classes for handling cookies, with no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.1) seems reasonable given the functions' nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard cookie handling, extraction, and management routines. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions perform standard cookie management tasks. The slightly higher risk score (0.2) accounts for potential misuse if untrusted data is fed into cookie creation, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is utility-focused, with no suspicious or malicious activity. It handles cookies from request/response objects, creates cookies, and manages cookie jars.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with no network activity or malicious intent. The zero malware score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the utility nature, no malicious code, no obfuscation, and standard cookie handling.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no suspicious activity. The low risk score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, standard cookie management utilities, no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is a set of utility functions/classes for cookie management, with no obfuscation, network activity, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in most cases (0.1 or 0.2), justified by the potential for misuse if untrusted data is fed into cookie creation functions. However, the core code is standard and safe.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, considering potential misuse but no active threat.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is standard, utility-focused, and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code review.",
