{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and utility functions for managing cookies in the requests library, including creating, extracting, and manipulating cookies and cookie jars.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from request objects (e.g., URL, headers, cookies), and from response objects (headers, message). Cookie data is extracted from response headers and cookie objects are created or modified via function calls.",
  "sinks": "Cookies are added to headers for requests; cookies are stored and retrieved from the cookiejar. Cookie extraction involves cookie jar modification, and cookies are deleted or retrieved by name, domain, and path.",
  "flows": "Input from request URL, headers, and response headers flows into cookie extraction and cookie creation functions; cookies are stored in cookiejar, and cookie headers are generated for outgoing requests.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets detected. Functions are straightforward utility implementations. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code uses standard library features and predictable control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie management functions including extracting cookies from responses, creating cookies, converting cookies from Morsel objects, and managing cookie jars with dictionary-like interfaces. It includes functions for removing cookies, copying jars, and merging cookies, all consistent with typical cookie handling logic. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or covert channels are present. The code adheres to normal expectations of cookie handling and does not perform any network communication or system modifications beyond cookie storage and retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility module for cookie management in the requests library. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious activity is detected. It operates within expected parameters for a cookie handling utility, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
