  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for handling cookies in the requests library, including cookie extraction, creation, and management.",
  "sources": "Import of modules: requests.utils, _internal_utils, compat; usage of request objects, response objects, and cookie data; functions that read headers, cookies, and request/response attributes.",
  "sinks": "Function extract_cookies_to_jar uses response headers; get_cookie_header accesses cookie headers; remove_cookie_by_name deletes cookies; set_cookie modifies cookies; various cookie management functions modify or access cookie data.",
  "flows": "Request object to CookieJar via extract_cookies_to_jar; cookie data flows from response headers to CookieJar; get_cookie_header generates cookie header string from jar; set/remove cookies manipulate CookieJar contents.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious network or file operations are present. The code performs standard cookie management tasks, with no hidden or malicious behavior. The comments and code structure are typical for cookie handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions and classes to handle cookies within the requests library, including converting requests into mock requests for cookie extraction, managing cookie data structures, and creating or removing cookies. It uses standard modules and straightforward logic without any suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code. All functions serve typical cookie management purposes and do not perform any actions outside normal cookie handling, such as data exfiltration, network connections to unknown domains, or code injection. The use of threading locks in cookie storage ensures thread safety. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for cookie management in the requests library, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It handles cookies securely and transparently without hidden or harmful actions. The code structure and comments suggest legitimate use, and there are no network or file operations indicating malicious behavior.",
