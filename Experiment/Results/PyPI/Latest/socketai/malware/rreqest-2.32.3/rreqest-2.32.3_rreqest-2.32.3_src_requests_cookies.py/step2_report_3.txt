  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions/classes for cookie handling, with no suspicious or malicious code detected. The confidence is high (1.0), malware score is 0, security risk is very low (0.1).\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's straightforward nature. No obfuscation, no network activity, no hidden behaviors.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard cookie management, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscation. Confidence is 0.9, malware=0, risk=0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The slightly higher risk score (0.2) accounts for the possibility of misuse, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard cookie utilities, no malicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity. Confidence 0.9, malware=0, risk=0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely utility functions, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard cookie management, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, with a risk score of 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score reflects the benign nature.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are suitable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous assessments—utility functions for cookie handling, no malicious activity, no obfuscation, confidence 1.0, risk=0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, and the scores match.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. No network activity, no obfuscation, no hidden code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports note no obfuscation; 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal potential misuse. Given the code's benign nature, I agree with the lower end of this spectrum.\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward utility module for cookie management, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk score accounts for the potential that, if misused, cookie handling could lead to security issues, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores given in the reports are consistent with the code's nature. I concur with their assessments and recommend no changes.",
