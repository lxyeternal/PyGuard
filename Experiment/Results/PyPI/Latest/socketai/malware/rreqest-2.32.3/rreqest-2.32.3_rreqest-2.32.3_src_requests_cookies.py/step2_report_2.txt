  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code provides compatibility and utility functions for cookie management, with no suspicious or malicious code detected. The malware score is 0.0, and the security risk is 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears straightforward, handling cookies via standard patterns, with no obfuscation or malicious behaviors. The logic aligns with typical cookie management routines.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The malware and risk scores seem appropriate. The low security risk (0.1) accounts for the minimal complexity and the potential for misconfiguration, but no actual vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard cookie management, with no signs of malicious activity. Malware score is 0, confidence is high.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are typical, with no external network activity or obfuscation. The reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are justified. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility-focused, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. It handles cookie extraction, creation, and management.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are standard, and no suspicious patterns or external communications are present.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The malware and security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for cookie handling, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The code is straightforward.\n\n- **Assessment:** No obfuscation, network activity, or hidden behaviors are detected.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard cookie management utilities, operating as expected, with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is typical for cookie handling, with no anomalies.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is standard, utility-focused, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis. The obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** The security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the minimal threat level, mainly due to the potential for misconfiguration or misuse, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final Expert Judgment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious code or behaviors detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, I would assign a slightly higher but still low risk score, around **0.1 to 0.2**, due to the possibility of misuse if the functions are exploited in a malicious context (e.g., injecting malicious cookies or headers).\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Estimate |\n|--------------------|----------------|\n| Malware Score      | 0.0            |\n| Obfuscated Score   | 0.0            |\n| Risk Score         | 0.1            |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured utility module for cookie management, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
