      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The setup script is standard and does not contain malicious intent or activity. The main concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which should be validated or replaced with safer import methods. The code is generally safe, with minimal security risk if the version file remains unaltered. No malware or obfuscation detected. The risk score can be slightly increased to 0.3 to account for the exec() pattern, but overall, the code is safe."

The only minor concern is potential sensitive data leakage if exceptions are logged externally, but this is outside the code scope. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate."

The rest of the code is legitimate, but the embedded malicious snippet overrides normal functionality. The malware score is 1, the security risk is 1, the obfuscation is minimal (0.2), and confidence in this assessment is high (0.9)."

The security risk is minimal, primarily related to reliance on assertions that could be disabled, but this is standard practice. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
