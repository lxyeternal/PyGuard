  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple variable assignments containing package metadata.\n- No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is standard for Python package metadata declarations.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are purely static variable assignments with no external data handling.\n- The \"malware\" score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The reports assign a \"confidence\" of 1.0, which seems appropriate given the straightforward, metadata-only nature.\n- The \"malware\" scores are all 0, correctly reflecting no malicious activity.\n- The \"obfuscated\" scores are 0, consistent with the code being clear and straightforward.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are 0, which is justified.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n**Final note:**\n- No further action needed; the code is safe and standard for package metadata.",
