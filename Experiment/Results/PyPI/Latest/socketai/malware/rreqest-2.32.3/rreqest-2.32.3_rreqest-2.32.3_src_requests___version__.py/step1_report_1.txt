  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library",
  "sources": "Assignment of metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; purely metadata definitions",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments containing package metadata information. No input handling, data processing, or external communication occurs. There are no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or malicious constructs, and no functions or dynamic code execution. This is typical package setup information without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata documentation for the 'requests' package. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a standard, safe package metadata declaration.",
