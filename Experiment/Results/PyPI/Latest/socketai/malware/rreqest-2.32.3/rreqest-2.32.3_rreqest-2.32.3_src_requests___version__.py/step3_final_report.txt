  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata variables for the 'requests' Python library, serving as static documentation and configuration information.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it consists solely of variable assignments within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leakage or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static metadata without dynamic or external data interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains only straightforward variable assignments with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static set of variable assignments providing package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and decorative emojis. It contains no input/output, network activity, or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified given the code's simplicity and static nature. Confidence is high (1.0) because the code is straightforward and well-understood. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package metadata declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
