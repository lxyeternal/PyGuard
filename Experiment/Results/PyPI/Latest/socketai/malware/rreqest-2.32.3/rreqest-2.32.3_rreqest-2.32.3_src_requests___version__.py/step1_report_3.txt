  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python HTTP library.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading operations present).",
  "targets": "None (no data output, network communication, or untrusted data sinks).",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks; the code only assigns metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of metadata variable assignments with no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only string assignments for package metadata, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright. There are no data inputs, network operations, or hidden behaviors. The metadata appears standard and benign. The absence of dynamic code, environment variable usage, or network activity indicates no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward metadata declaration for the 'requests' library, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
