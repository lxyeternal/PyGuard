{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility support for various Python versions and third-party libraries, mainly handling imports and version detection for urllib3 and character detection libraries.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment details (Python version info), library import attempts (importlib, simplejson, urllib3), and system version info (sys.version_info).",
  "sinks": "No dangerous sinks are present; the code mainly handles library imports and version checks. No untrusted data is processed in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from sources to sinks. The code's flow is primarily initialization and compatibility setup without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments. The code performs standard compatibility imports and version checks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment detection, library import resolution, and compatibility setup. It includes safe import attempts with exception handling. No untrusted data processing, no network or file manipulations, and no suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The import patterns and exception handling are typical for compatibility layers. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign compatibility layer for Python 2/3 and third-party library support. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior. It functions as expected for a utility module.",
