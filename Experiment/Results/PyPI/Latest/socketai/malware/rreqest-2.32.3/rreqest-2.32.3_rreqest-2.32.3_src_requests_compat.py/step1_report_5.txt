{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility support for different Python versions and imports necessary libraries for handling HTTP requests, character encoding detection, and data structures, primarily for backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module for 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', sys.version_info, package imports like 'simplejson' or 'json', and standard library modules for URL handling and data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; the code mainly performs import and version detection without executing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves conditional imports and version checks, with no data processing or execution of external or untrusted data inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code segments, hardcoded secrets, or behaviors that could indicate malicious intent are present. The code performs standard compatibility tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles compatibility issues by importing modules conditionally based on Python version and available packages. It attempts to import 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' dynamically, with exception handling to avoid errors. It detects urllib3 version and sets flags accordingly. It defines utility functions for character detection and imports JSON libraries, preferring 'simplejson' if available. Standard library modules are imported for URL and cookie handling. The code redefines basic types like 'str' and 'bytes', which is typical for compatibility. No external data is processed or executed, and no suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, non-malicious compatibility module designed to support multiple Python versions and dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or supply chain attacks.",
