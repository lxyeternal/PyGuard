  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code's behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies that the code handles compatibility, version detection, optional dependencies, and imports. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.\n- **Assessment:** The code performs standard import logic, version checks, and dynamic module resolution for 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'. No data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes that the code manages imports and compatibility without malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The dynamic import pattern, version detection, and conditional imports are typical for compatibility layers.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here; the code is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is described as a compatibility support module with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code's logic revolves around safe import attempts, version detection, and setting flags. No data processing or untrusted input handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the straightforward import and configuration logic, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The code's pattern of optional imports and version detection is common and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the code as a compatibility layer, with a high confidence score, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The detailed explanation confirms that the code is standard, with no obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily about compatibility, import resolution, and version detection.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are zero, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Risk scores:** Zero risk scores are appropriate given the absence of any suspicious activity or data handling.\n- **Malware score justification:** Since there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** No security risks are evident, so zero is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard compatibility utility module with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are consistent, and their scores are justified. No changes are necessary.",
