{
  "purpose": "This module handles compatibility issues across Python versions and imports necessary libraries for HTTP requests and character detection.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (importlib, sys, urllib3, collections, http, io, urllib) and dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported functions (e.g., urlparse, quote, getproxies) which could process untrusted input if misused elsewhere, but not in this code segment.",
  "flows": "No significant data flows; primarily import and configuration logic with no processing of untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "None. The code performs standard compatibility and import management without any unusual or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, involving import statements, version detection, and optional library loading. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, data leaks, or code injections. The dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' is a common pattern for compatibility and character detection. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured compatibility and import handling module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
