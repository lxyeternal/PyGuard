{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility support and utility functions for handling character detection and URL parsing across different Python versions and libraries.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (importlib, sys, collections, http, io), third-party libraries (urllib3, simplejson, chardet), and environment variables (via urllib.parse and urllib.request).",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or manipulates untrusted data; however, imports and version checks could influence behavior in broader contexts. No explicit data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports various modules and sets compatibility flags, with no data flow from sources to sinks or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs version detection and module importing without any suspicious or obfuscated logic. The dynamic import of optional libraries is standard for compatibility and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on importing modules, handling compatibility between Python 2 and 3, and resolving optional dependencies such as 'chardet' and 'simplejson'. It employs typical version checks and import mechanisms. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. All code functions serve compatibility and utility purposes, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a compatibility utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard import and version detection tasks necessary for maintaining backward compatibility and supporting multiple environments.",
