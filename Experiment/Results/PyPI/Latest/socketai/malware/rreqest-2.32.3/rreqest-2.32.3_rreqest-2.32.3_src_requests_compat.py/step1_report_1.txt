{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility utilities for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as managing dependencies and imports related to character detection and URL handling.",
  "sources": "Reads import statements for modules such as importlib, sys, urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, collections, http.cookies, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions. No network connections, file writes, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows from sources to sinks indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code appears standard for compatibility purposes with no hidden behaviors or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly handles module imports, version checks, and compatibility features. It dynamically resolves character detection libraries, manages imports based on Python version, and sets up common utility functions for URL handling and JSON parsing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious patterns. The import resolution and version checks are standard and do not involve untrusted data or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility and utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains typical import and version detection logic used in cross-version Python packages. No malware indicators or security threats are detected.",
