{
  "purpose": "This module manages import compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3, handles version detection, and resolves optional dependencies such as 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version detection logic, dynamic import attempts for optional libraries, and environment variable checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks, network activity, or file operations.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves detecting library versions and conditionally importing modules, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard compatibility and import resolution patterns are used. No obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version checks, conditional imports, and sets compatibility flags. It uses typical patterns for handling differences between Python versions and optional dependencies. There are no data flows involving untrusted input, no network or file operations, and no obfuscated or malicious code segments. The import logic and version detection are straightforward and standard for such utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, standard implementation.",
