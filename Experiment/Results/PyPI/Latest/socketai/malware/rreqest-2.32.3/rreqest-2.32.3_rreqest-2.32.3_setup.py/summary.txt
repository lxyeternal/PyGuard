  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard and does not contain malicious intent or activity. The main concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which should be validated or replaced with safer import methods. The code is generally safe, with minimal security risk if the version file remains unaltered. No malware or obfuscation detected. The risk score can be slightly increased to 0.3 to account for the exec() pattern, but overall, the code is safe."
