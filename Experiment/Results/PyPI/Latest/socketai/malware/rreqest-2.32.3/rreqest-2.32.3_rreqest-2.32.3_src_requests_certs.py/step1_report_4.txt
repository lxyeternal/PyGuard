{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves and prints the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the 'where' function import.",
  "sinks": "The printed output could be used by other parts of an application to locate CA certificates; no direct data leak or untrusted input handling is involved.",
  "flows": "Input is the certifi 'where' function call; output is the printed file path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a trusted library (certifi) and simply prints the location of its CA bundle. There are no user inputs, no external data sources, no risky code execution, or suspicious behavior. The purpose aligns with standard practices for handling SSL certificates. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malicious data flow. The code is minimal, clear, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and functions as a utility to display the default CA bundle location. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
