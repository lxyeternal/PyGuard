  "purpose": "Outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package, serving as an informational utility.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from the 'certifi' package; reading the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "Printing the CA bundle path; no untrusted data or external inputs involved.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' -> call to 'where()' -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, and relies on a trusted library without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known function from 'certifi' and prints its output when run directly. It performs no network activity, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and trustworthiness of the code. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's purpose is purely informational, with no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, performing a simple, trusted operation without any malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
