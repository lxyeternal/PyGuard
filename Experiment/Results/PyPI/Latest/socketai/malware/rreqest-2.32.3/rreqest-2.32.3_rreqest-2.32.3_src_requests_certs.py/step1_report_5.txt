  "purpose": "This module provides the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package, primarily for use in verifying SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location from the 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the CA bundle location to standard output, which could be used by other components for SSL verification.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function provides the CA bundle path; when the script is executed directly, it prints this path.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward, well-structured, and only performs a simple import and print operation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'where' from 'certifi', a reputable package, and prints the CA bundle location when run directly. It does not process untrusted input, perform network activity, or execute any malicious operations. The purpose is clear and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple utility for retrieving and displaying the default CA bundle path from 'certifi'. There are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious code, and it serves a legitimate purpose related to SSL verification. The code is safe and typical for its function.",
