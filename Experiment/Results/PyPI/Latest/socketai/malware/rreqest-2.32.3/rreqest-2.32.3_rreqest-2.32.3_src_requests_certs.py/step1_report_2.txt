  "purpose": "To provide the default CA bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for certificate verification.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the certifi package, which returns the path to the CA bundle.",
  "sinks": "Printing the CA bundle path; no untrusted data processing or data leakage occurs.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function is called, and its output is printed; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries for a common purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints its output when executed directly. It does not process external inputs, perform network operations, or contain hidden or malicious code. The purpose is to display the path to a trusted CA bundle. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to print the default CA bundle path. It poses no security risks or malicious intent, serving a legitimate and safe purpose.",
