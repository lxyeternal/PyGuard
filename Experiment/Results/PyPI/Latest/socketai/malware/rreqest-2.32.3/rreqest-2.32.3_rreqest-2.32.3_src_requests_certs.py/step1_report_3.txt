{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility to print the default CA bundle path used by the certifi package, primarily for use in packaging or distribution scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The only output is printing the CA bundle path; no untrusted data is processed or output elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The code calls certifi.where() to retrieve the CA bundle location, then prints it to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the certifi package and, when executed directly, prints the path to the CA bundle. It is a simple utility script with no input handling or network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leakage. The code is minimal and focused on its intended purpose without any suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script intended to output the default CA bundle path from the certifi package. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It simply provides an informational output for packaging or distribution purposes.",
