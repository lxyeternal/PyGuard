  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'print(where())' to output the certificate bundle path.",
  "flows": "Import -> Function call -> Output via print()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. The code simply exposes the path to a certificate bundle.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a well-known library 'certifi' and outputs its CA bundle path. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The purpose appears to be providing the CA bundle path for use in other contexts. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and intended to output the path to a CA certificate bundle. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
