{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for the requests library to handle various error conditions during HTTP operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and internal compat module; class constructors and methods.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink that handles untrusted data or causes data leaks; no code that writes data or executes external commands.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; code primarily defines exception classes and their initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code appears to follow standard patterns for exception class definitions. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a hierarchy of exception classes for a request handling library, with standard inheritance and docstrings. No malicious behavior or anomalies such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code uses standard Python practices for exception definition, and all imports are from well-known modules. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or external communication are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for handling HTTP request errors, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
