{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes used by the Requests library for handling various HTTP and network errors.",
  "sources": "The code primarily defines classes and imports; no data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data handling that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted data; the classes are used for exception handling and do not process external input directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are observed. The code is straightforward exception class definitions with standard inheritance and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exception classes and defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for HTTP request errors. The structure and comments indicate standard error handling design. No evidence of code injection, malicious behavior, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The presence of warning classes also aligns with normal library functionality. The code is static, with no runtime data processing or external inputs that could be exploited. No obfuscated code features or unusual constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of exception classes for a requests-like library, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and aligned with typical error handling patterns in Python networking code.",
