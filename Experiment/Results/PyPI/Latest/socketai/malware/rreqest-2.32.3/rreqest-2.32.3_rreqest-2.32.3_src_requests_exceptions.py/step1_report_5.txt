{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of exception classes for handling errors in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; exception handling code typically deals with errors during HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "Exception initialization and handling could potentially leak sensitive data if error messages contain secrets, but no such leakage is evident here.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised during various request failures; no external untrusted data flows into these classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; inheritance and exception handling are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes for a requests library, inheriting from standard Python exceptions and HTTP-related exceptions. No external input is processed here, and no code executes dynamically or accesses external data. The only potential concern would be if exception messages contained sensitive data, but none is visible or explicitly handled here. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured set of exception class definitions for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard exception class hierarchy for a requests-based HTTP library. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are evident. The implementation is typical and does not involve any suspicious or harmful code.",
