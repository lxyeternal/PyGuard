  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No, the code is just class definitions for exceptions.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None detected; the code follows standard Python practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The code is straightforward and safe.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly rated as safe with no risks.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No, exception classes with attribute handling.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No, the handling of 'response' and 'request' attributes is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior; potential data leaks are only a concern if logs or external handling mishandles sensitive data, but that's outside this code.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly rated as safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No, class definitions for exceptions.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None; standard patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Properly rated.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No, exception hierarchy.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code being just class definitions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final recommendation:\nGiven the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a standard, safe implementation of exception classes for an HTTP request library, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. No further action needed.",
