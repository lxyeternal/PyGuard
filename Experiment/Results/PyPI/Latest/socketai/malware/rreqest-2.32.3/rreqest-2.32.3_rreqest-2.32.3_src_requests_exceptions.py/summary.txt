  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of exception classes for the requests library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor concern is potential sensitive data leakage if exceptions are logged externally, but this is outside the code scope. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate."
