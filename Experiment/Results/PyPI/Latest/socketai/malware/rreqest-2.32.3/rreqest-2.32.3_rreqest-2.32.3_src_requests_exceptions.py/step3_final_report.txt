{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling HTTP request errors and related issues in the requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and internal compat module; class constructors and attributes such as response and request.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; exception attributes could potentially leak sensitive data if logged externally, but this is outside the code's scope.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources; primarily class definitions with attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard exception hierarchy.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard exception class definitions for request handling, with proper inheritance and attribute management. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external data processing is present. The attributes response and request could contain sensitive data, but this is typical for such exceptions and not a security flaw. The __reduce__ method supports pickling without issues. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of exception classes for the requests library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor concern is potential sensitive data leakage if exceptions are logged externally, but this is outside the code scope. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate.",
