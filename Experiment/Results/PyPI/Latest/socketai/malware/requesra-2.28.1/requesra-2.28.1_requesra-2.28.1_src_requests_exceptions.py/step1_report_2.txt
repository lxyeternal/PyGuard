{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling various request errors and warnings in the requests library.",
  "sources": "None (defines classes and imports, no data input sources).",
  "sinks": "None (no data processing or output functions; only class definitions).",
  "flows": "Not applicable (no data flow or data handling).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; standard exception class definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code provides exception class definitions for request handling errors, such as HTTPError, ConnectionError, Timeout, and others. It imports external exceptions from urllib3 and compat modules, and defines custom exception hierarchies with appropriate inheritance. No data processing, input/output, network communication, or code execution occurs here. The structure and content are typical for a well-defined exception module. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be standard library code intended for error handling within the requests package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions for request error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to define exception types for the requests library.",
