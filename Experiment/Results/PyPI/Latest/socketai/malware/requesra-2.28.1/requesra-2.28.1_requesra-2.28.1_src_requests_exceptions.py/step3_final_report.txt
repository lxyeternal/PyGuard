{
  "purpose": "Defines exception and warning classes for the requests library, facilitating error handling and categorization.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and .compat modules; class constructors accessing attributes like response and request.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely class definitions with attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard exception class definitions with appropriate inheritance, constructors, and a __reduce__ method for pickling support. It imports from well-known modules and does not include dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The use of __reduce__ in JSONDecodeError is standard for serialization, not suspicious. The overall pattern aligns with typical internal error handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe exception hierarchy for the requests library, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The analysis confirms it is purely structural, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
