  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a set of exception class definitions for the requests library.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or code execution occurs within these classes.\n- The code imports standard exceptions and defines custom exceptions with typical inheritance.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The __reduce__ method in JSONDecodeError is standard for pickling support, not malicious.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The exception classes are well-structured, with appropriate inheritance.\n- The use of multiple inheritance (e.g., JSONDecodeError inheriting from both InvalidJSONError and CompatJSONDecodeError) is standard practice.\n- The code is purely for error categorization and handling within the library.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or 0.5, but given the nature of the code, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- No issues found. The code is standard, well-structured, and safe.\n- The only point to consider is that the JSONDecodeError's __reduce__ method is necessary for pickling, which is standard and not suspicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard exception hierarchy for the requests library.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk code is present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical, safe, internal error handling module with no security concerns.",
