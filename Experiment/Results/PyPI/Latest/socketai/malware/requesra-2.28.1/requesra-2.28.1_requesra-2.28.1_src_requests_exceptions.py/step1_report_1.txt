{
  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling various errors and warnings in the requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the import statements and class initializations.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data handling occurs in exception and warning messages, but these are internal error handling classes, not user-input or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines exception hierarchy, with no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard class definitions for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of exception and warning class definitions related to the requests library. It imports necessary exceptions, defines custom exceptions inheriting from standard Python exceptions, and adds docstrings explaining their purpose. The class hierarchy appears normal, with no code executing untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated constructs. The presence of exception chaining and inheritance is typical for error handling modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden code. The code appears standard, well-structured, and intended for error management in a HTTP request context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard exception class definition module for the requests library with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It serves to categorize and handle different error scenarios internally without any signs of malware or security risks.",
