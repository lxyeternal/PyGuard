  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), item access (__getitem__), update, and get methods.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Data is stored in internal structures (_store and __dict__) with no external data flow or malicious handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides implementations of CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. These classes implement standard dictionary behaviors with case-insensitive key handling and custom string representations. No external data input sources, network operations, or system calls are present. The data handling is straightforward, and no code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is evident. The code relies on standard library collections and inheritance without unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup objects for internal use within the Requests library. No malicious behavior, security risks, or malware are detected.",
