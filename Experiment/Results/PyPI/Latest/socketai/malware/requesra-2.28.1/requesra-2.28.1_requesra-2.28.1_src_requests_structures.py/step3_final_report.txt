{
  "purpose": "Provides case-insensitive and lookup dictionary-like data structures used internally within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Reads data from initialization parameters, dictionary updates, and internal store during method calls.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; operates solely on internal data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into internal store; no external or untrusted data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "The 'copy()' method in 'CaseInsensitiveDict' incorrectly returns 'self._store.values()', which is a view object, not a proper copy; this is a bug but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes for managing headers and lookup data with case-insensitivity. No external data flows, network activity, or system modifications are present. The only technical concern is the 'copy()' method, which does not correctly implement copying but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. The classes do not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The overall structure and behavior are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and benign, serving as internal utility data structures. The only issue is the incorrect 'copy()' implementation, which should be fixed for correctness but does not pose security risks.",
