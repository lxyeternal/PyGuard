  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionary-like objects and a simple lookup dictionary used within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), item access (__getitem__), update methods, and class constructors.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions detected.",
  "flows": "Data is stored and retrieved within dictionary-like structures, mainly in memory; no external data flow or network interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The classes implement standard dictionary patterns without unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. Both are standard implementations: one provides case-insensitive key handling, the other is a simple named dictionary. Methods perform typical operations like setting, getting, deleting, and copying data. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or dangerous behaviors. No external system interactions, network calls, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be utility classes for internal use within the Requests library, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility data structure definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows. It is safe based on this analysis.",
