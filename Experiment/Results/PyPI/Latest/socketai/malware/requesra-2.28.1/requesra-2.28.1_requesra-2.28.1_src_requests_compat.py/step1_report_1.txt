{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling character detection, JSON parsing, and URL operations across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, function definitions, and sys.version_info for Python version detection.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "No significant source-to-sink data flows that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code performs standard compatibility and import handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily concerned with importing modules, detecting Python version, and setting up compatibility variables. The function _resolve_char_detection attempts to import optional character detection libraries ('chardet' or 'charset_normalizer') but handles import failures gracefully. It sets up version-specific flags and imports modules for JSON handling, URL parsing, and other utilities without executing untrusted input or performing dangerous operations. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be standard and safe for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a straightforward compatibility utility module with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended for version compatibility and module imports without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
