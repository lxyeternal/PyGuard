  "purpose": "Compatibility handling for Python 2 and 3, managing imports and optional dependencies like chardet, charset_normalizer, and simplejson.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as importlib, sys, json, collections, http, io, urllib, and optional character detection libraries.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; import resolution is static and handled with exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; the dynamic import pattern is standard for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility utility for Python 2 and 3, handling import resolution, version detection, and optional library loading. It uses standard exception handling and static imports without executing untrusted code or network activity. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The only minor concern is the dynamic import resolution, which could, in theory, be exploited if the environment is compromised, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility with negligible security concerns. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are evident. The slight risk score reflects the environment-dependent import pattern but does not indicate an actual vulnerability.",
