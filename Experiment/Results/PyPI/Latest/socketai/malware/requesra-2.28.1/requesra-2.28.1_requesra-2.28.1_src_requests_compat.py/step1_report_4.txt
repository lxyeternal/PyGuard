{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility handling for different Python versions and character detection libraries, as well as imports for URL handling, JSON processing, and other utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements, dynamic import of chardet or charset_normalizer, sys.version_info for Python version detection, optional import of simplejson",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not execute untrusted data or perform any network or file operations",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly performs imports and feature detection",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard compatibility and import logic, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code initializes compatibility layers for Python 2 and 3, attempts to import character detection libraries, and sets up import aliases for JSON handling. It also imports various modules for URL and data handling. All operations are standard and do not process external or untrusted data. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code is primarily for maintaining backward compatibility and environment detection.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages imports and version detection for the package, with no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
