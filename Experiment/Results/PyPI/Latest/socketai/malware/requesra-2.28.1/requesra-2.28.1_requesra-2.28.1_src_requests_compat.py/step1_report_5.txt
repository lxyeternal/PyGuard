  "purpose": "The module handles import compatibility issues and library detection for Python 2 and 3 environments, mainly for supporting character detection libraries and JSON parsing.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info, exception handling for module imports, functions for dynamic library detection",
  "sinks": "Import statements and dynamic module imports could potentially lead to code execution if malicious modules are present in the environment",
  "flows": "Importing modules dynamically with importlib and handling exceptions could allow malicious modules to be imported if present in the environment, but this is limited to standard libraries or available third-party modules",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The dynamic import resolution for 'chardet' and 'simplejson' appears standard but could be misused if environment is compromised",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages compatibility and optional library imports, using standard Python practices. The dynamic import resolution of 'chardet' and 'simplejson' is typical and not inherently malicious. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or code injection mechanisms are present. The use of exception handling around module imports is standard for compatibility. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are identified. Overall, the code appears to be a benign compatibility utility, with minimal risk, assuming the environment is secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility utility for import handling and does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It dynamically loads optional libraries with standard practices. No security risks are evident in this fragment.",
