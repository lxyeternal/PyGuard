{
  "purpose": "This module handles import compatibility and character detection for the requests library, providing backward compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3.",
  "sources": "Import statements (importlib, sys, simplejson, json, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request)",
  "sinks": "No evident sink functions that process untrusted data directly; import statements are static and standard.",
  "flows": "The code loads modules and sets compatibility flags, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code mainly manages compatibility and imports, with no suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs module imports, version checks, and compatibility setups. It dynamically imports 'chardet' and 'simplejson' if available, but these are standard libraries used for character detection and JSON parsing. No use of eval, exec, or other dynamic code execution techniques. No hardcoded secrets, network communication, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a compatibility utility for the requests library, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It simply manages imports and compatibility features. Overall, it appears safe and standard.",
