  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard compatibility functions, import handling, and character detection.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malicious code, no data leaks. The code is straightforward, handling imports and version detection.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully benign, standard compatibility code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing backward compatibility and module imports.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious intent, no dynamic code execution, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Also benign, typical utility code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility handling, optional library detection.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No untrusted data processing, no dynamic code execution, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Safe, standard code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility and import detection.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No data processing from untrusted sources, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, with note on potential risks due to dynamic imports.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The main concern is that dynamic import resolution could be exploited if malicious modules are present in the environment, but this is a standard pattern and relies on environment integrity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, overall risk=0.1.\n\n**Justification for risk score:** The only slight concern is the environment-dependent import, which could be exploited if an attacker controls the environment. However, this is a common pattern in Python for optional dependencies and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0. The code does not perform any malicious actions—no network activity, no code injection, no obfuscated code, no backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.1. The only minor concern is environment-dependent import resolution, which is a common pattern but could be exploited if the environment is compromised.\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, due to environment-based import resolution, but this is typical and not inherently dangerous unless the environment is compromised.\n\n**Note:** The code is a standard compatibility utility, and no suspicious or malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|------------------|------------|\n| 0               | 0                | 0.1        |\n\nThis reflects a benign utility module with a very low, environment-related, potential risk that is common in such code.",
