  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard compatibility handling, import statements, and version detection.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior, no dynamic code execution, no untrusted data processing. The function `_resolve_char_detection()` attempts to import optional libraries (`chardet`, `charset_normalizer`) gracefully, which is standard practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Completely benign, aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing backward compatibility.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious behavior, no dynamic code execution, no secrets, or network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Also benign and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility handling, optional library detection.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, no dynamic execution, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Correctly identified as safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility and import setup.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no untrusted data processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility, dynamic import resolution.\n- **Analysis:** Notes that dynamic imports could, in theory, be misused if environment is compromised, but in this code, they are limited to standard or third-party modules. No actual malicious behavior, secrets, or code injection.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (slightly higher due to potential misuse of dynamic import, but in this context, negligible).  \n**Assessment:** Slightly cautious but still aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a compatibility utility module. It handles module imports, version detection, and optional library loading in a standard, non-malicious manner.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** Given the nature of the code, the risk is minimal. The only slight concern in Report 5 about dynamic imports is theoretical; in practice, the code only imports known modules, and no untrusted data is processed or executed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose and implementation, a risk score of **0.1** (as in Report 5) is reasonable, reflecting minimal potential if environment is compromised, but not an actual security issue in this context.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a straightforward, standard compatibility utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature. I would suggest:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to acknowledge minimal potential misuse, but overall very safe)\n\n**Work out:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThis reflects a benign, well-understood utility module with negligible security concerns.",
