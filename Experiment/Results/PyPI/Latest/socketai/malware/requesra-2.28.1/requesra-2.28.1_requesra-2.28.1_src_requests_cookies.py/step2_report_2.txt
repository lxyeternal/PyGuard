  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The report correctly identifies that the code manages cookies, extracting from responses, adding headers, and manipulating cookie jars.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity. Use of standard modules and patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, implementing standard cookie management routines. No malicious behavior or signs of sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** The scores seem appropriate. The low security risk reflects the benign nature, and malware is correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, with standard cookie utilities, including creation, extraction, and merging.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of mock classes for interface compatibility, no suspicious code or network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The functions are standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Scores align with the benign, utility nature of the code. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Utility functions for cookie management, with mock classes and standard patterns.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, standard cookie handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are consistent with the benign description.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar cookie management utilities, with standard patterns.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The slightly higher security risk (0.2) is acceptable given the nature of cookie handling, but still low overall.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard cookie utilities, wrappers, extraction, header creation.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, safe, and standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, matching the absence of obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting the low-risk nature of cookie management code, which by itself doesn't introduce significant security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the detailed analyses.\n- No modifications are necessary; the assessments correctly reflect the benign, utility nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to cookie handling, which can be sensitive but is implemented safely here.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured utility module for cookie management with no signs of malware or obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
