  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard, legitimate utility for cookie management, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, uses standard modules, and performs typical cookie operations. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate given the utility nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes standard cookie utilities, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the reasoning aligns with the code's functionality. No signs of malware or obfuscation. The score seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides cookie management utilities, with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous reports. The code is utility-focused, with no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes standard cookie management functions, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSlightly higher security risk score (0.2) but still within reasonable bounds for a utility module. No malware or obfuscation indicated.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard cookie handling, no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the others. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Judgment:\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code snippets are all consistent with legitimate cookie management utilities. No hidden code, obfuscated logic, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code performs cookie handling, which is inherently benign.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher at 0.1 or 0.2, but still low. The code's purpose is to manage cookies, which is standard and safe.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's purpose.\n- No adjustments needed; the reasoning is sound.\n- The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard utility module for cookie management within the requests library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the detailed reasoning provided.\n\n**Overall security assessment:** Low risk, no malware, no obfuscation.",
