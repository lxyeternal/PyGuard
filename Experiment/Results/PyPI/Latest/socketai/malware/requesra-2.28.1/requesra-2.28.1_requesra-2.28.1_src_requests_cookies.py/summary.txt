  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility module for cookie management with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
