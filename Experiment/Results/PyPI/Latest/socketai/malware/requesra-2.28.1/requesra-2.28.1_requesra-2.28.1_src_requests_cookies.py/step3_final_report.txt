  "purpose": "Utility module for managing HTTP cookies within the requests library, including extraction, creation, merging, and compatibility wrappers.",
  "sources": "Reads from request headers, request URL, and response headers (via MockRequest and MockResponse classes).",
  "sinks": "Provides cookie headers for requests, modifies cookie jar contents, and extracts cookies from responses.",
  "flows": "Request headers and URL as sources; cookie jar operations and header modifications as sinks; flow from request/response data to cookie jar updates.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity; code uses standard patterns and libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of cookie management utilities, including classes for compatibility and functions for cookie extraction, creation, and merging. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of mock classes is for interface compatibility, not malicious intent. The security implications are minimal, confined to cookie handling, which is inherently benign. The code does not perform any network activity beyond cookie processing, nor does it contain hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility module for cookie management with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
