  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and determine the appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes cookie management functions, wrapping request/response objects, no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** The code is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. Uses typical patterns for cookie handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code, low malware risk, minimal security risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 (low, given the utility nature)  \n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focuses on cookie utilities, compatibility wrappers, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Utility functions, safe, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie management, extraction, header creation, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Uses mock classes for interface compatibility, no network or hidden code.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe cookie utilities.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, cookie handling, extraction, creation, no malicious signs.\n- **Analysis:** No network activity, no obfuscated code, standard library usage.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate cookie management code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 (slightly higher but still low, considering the code's utility nature)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard cookie utilities, no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, no obfuscation, limited to cookie handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, consistent with the code's purpose as a cookie utility module.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, as the code is utility-focused and does not perform any network activity or system modifications.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (reflecting minimal security concern due to the utility nature)\n\n**Final justification:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation of cookie management functions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the actual code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. The code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation concerns.",
