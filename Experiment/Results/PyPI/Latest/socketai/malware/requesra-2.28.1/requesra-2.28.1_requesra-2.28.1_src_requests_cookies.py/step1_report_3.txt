{
  "purpose": "Provides utility classes and functions for managing cookies within the requests library, including compatibility with urllib and cookie handling.",
  "sources": "Requests and responses for cookie extraction and header creation; input parameters for cookie manipulation functions.",
  "sinks": "Header modification (add_unredirected_header), cookie extraction, cookie setting, and deletion functions.",
  "flows": "Request object → header inspection/modification; Response headers → cookie extraction; Cookie data → storage, retrieval, or deletion.",
  "anomalies": "Use of mock classes to mimic urllib objects; no evident hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity; standard cookie handling logic.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of cookie management utilities, including mock request/response wrappers, cookie extraction, and cookie jar manipulation. It employs standard patterns and data structures for handling cookies, including safe creation, merging, and deletion. No network calls, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are present. Usage of threading locks appears appropriate for thread safety. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected. The code is consistent with open-source cookie management utilities, and there are no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate cookie handling compatibly across different systems, with no suspicious or harmful features.",
