  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility and utility functions for managing cookies within the requests library, including creating, extracting, and manipulating cookie jars and cookies.",
  "sources": "Requests cookies and headers, response message headers, request URL and headers, environment variables (indirectly via imported modules), user input via cookies or request parameters.",
  "sinks": "Cookie headers added to requests, cookies extracted into jar, cookies modified or deleted, cookie data sent over network, internal cookie data stored or retrieved.",
  "flows": "Request headers (cookies) → add_cookie_header() → get_cookie_header() → cookies stored/retrieved in CookieJar → extraction from response headers to jar → cookie manipulation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Use of standard cookie handling libraries and no suspicious network activity or hidden code paths identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for cookie management, including wrapping request and response objects, extracting cookies from responses, and handling cookie storage and retrieval. It uses standard modules and patterns consistent with legitimate cookie handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or covert channels are present. The code adheres to expected functionality for cookie management, with no anomalies or malware signals. The functions perform cookie creation, extraction, deletion, and merging, all in a standard manner. No external or hidden network communications are present. Overall, the code is a straightforward, well-structured utility module for cookie handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module for cookie management within the requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, no signs of obfuscation or sabotage, and implements standard, safe cookie handling routines. Its malware score is low, and security risk is minimal. No suspicious or harmful activities are detected.",
