  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies with requests, including creating, extracting, managing, and merging cookies in a manner compatible with http.cookiejar.",
  "sources": "Requests and responses (headers, request URL, request headers, response message headers), input parameters to functions like request, response, cookie data, cookie jar instances.",
  "sinks": "Cookie manipulation functions (set, get, remove), cookie header generation, cookie jar modification, cookie creation, cookie extraction from response.",
  "flows": "Input request/response data -> cookie extraction or cookie header generation -> cookie jar updates or cookie retrieval -> possible cookie deletion or updates.",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom mock classes for request and response to interface with cookiejar; no direct or unsafe code injections; standard cookie handling functions; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious domain connections; proper exception handling. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements cookie management functionalities such as creating cookies, extracting cookies from responses, adding/removing cookies, and providing a dict-like interface for cookie jars. It uses standard libraries and patterns, with mock classes to interface with cookiejar. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or obfuscated patterns are present. The functions handle data securely and do not contain suspicious or malicious logic. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate utility functions for cookie management, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of cookie management utilities for requests, with standard, transparent implementations. No malicious or malicious-sounding behavior detected. It solely provides cookie handling functionality and does not perform any harmful actions.",
