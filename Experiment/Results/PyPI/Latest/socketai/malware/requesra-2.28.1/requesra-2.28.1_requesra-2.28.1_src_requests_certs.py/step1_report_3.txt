{
  "purpose": "This code provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the requests library, primarily for SSL verification purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The source ('where' function from certifi) is called and its output is printed to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and does not include any unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package, which returns the path to the trusted CA bundle. When executed directly, it prints this path. The code is simple, with no user input handling, no external network interactions, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. Its purpose is to inform users of the CA bundle location, especially useful when packaging or customizing SSL verification behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that reports the CA bundle path from certifi. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, poses no security risk, and appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to SSL configuration.",
