{
  "purpose": "This module provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used for SSL verification in HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'certifi' package via the 'where' function, which returns the path to the CA bundle.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is used; the script only outputs a file path.",
  "flows": "The flow is: import 'where' from 'certifi' -> call 'where()' -> print the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a trusted third-party library 'certifi' and simply outputs the path to the CA bundle. It has no user input, no network activity, and no data manipulation or processing that could introduce security issues. The code serves a utility purpose for packaging or debugging and does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and appears solely intended to retrieve and display the default CA bundle path. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
