  "purpose": "To provide the path to the default CA certificate bundle using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the code simply prints the CA bundle path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only interacts with the certifi library to output a file path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints its output when run directly. There are no inputs, user data handling, or external data sources. The use of 'certifi' is standard for obtaining trusted CA bundles. The code does not perform any network operations, data manipulation, or system modifications. It is a simple utility script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves a basic purpose of outputting the default CA certificate bundle path. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
