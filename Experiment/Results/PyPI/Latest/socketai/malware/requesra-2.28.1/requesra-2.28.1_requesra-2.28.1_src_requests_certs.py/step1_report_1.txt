{
  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the certificate bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The code calls 'where()' (source) and outputs the result via 'print()' (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward usage of certifi's API. No obfuscated or dynamic code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi', which provides the path to the CA bundle. When executed as main, it prints this path. There are no external inputs, no data flows that could be exploited, and no suspicious or malicious code present. The code is simple and serves a benign purpose, primarily for debugging or configuration verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility to display the default CA bundle path used by requests. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is a straightforward, safe script.",
