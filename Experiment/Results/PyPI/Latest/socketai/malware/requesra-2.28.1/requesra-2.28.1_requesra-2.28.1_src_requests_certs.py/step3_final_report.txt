  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' and the call to 'where()' when executed as a script.",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output (print), no untrusted data processing or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The script calls 'where()' from 'certifi' and prints its result; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility that imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints its value when run directly. It contains no user input, network activity, or data manipulation. All reports correctly identify its benign purpose and absence of malicious intent. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate, and confidence is high (1). There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities present. The code serves a legitimate purpose and is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
