{
  "purpose": "The code provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the requests library, primarily for verifying SSL connections.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location from the 'certifi' package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the code only prints the CA bundle path.",
  "flows": "Input source: 'where()' function from 'certifi' package; Output sink: 'print' statement displaying the path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and solely retrieves and displays a certificate bundle path without any unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from 'certifi', then prints its output when run directly. This is a simple utility script with no external data inputs, no data processing, and no interaction with untrusted sources. It does not perform any network operations, data leakage, or malicious activities. The code's structure and purpose are clear and typical for its function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility for printing the location of the default CA bundle used by requests. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and has no anomalies or suspicious elements.",
