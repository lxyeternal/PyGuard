{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for handling and validating HTTP headers and string conversions within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily from function parameters such as 'string' and 'u_string'. No external data sources or user input reading beyond function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include string decoding and encoding functions, and regex matching, which are used internally for validation and processing but do not appear to send data externally or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through encoding/decoding functions and regex validations. No data flows into external systems or untrusted sources directly; validation functions process data internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The regex patterns are straightforward and serve validation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for header validation and includes utility functions for string handling and ASCII validation. It relies on safe, standard library functions and internal data validation techniques. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or external data leaks are present. The functions are straightforward, with no network operations or sensitive data handling beyond header validation and string conversion.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions used internally by the Requests library for header validation and string handling. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious behavior.",
