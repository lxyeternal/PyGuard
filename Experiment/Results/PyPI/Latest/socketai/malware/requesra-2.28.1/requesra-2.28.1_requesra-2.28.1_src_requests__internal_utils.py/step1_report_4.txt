{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions for handling string conversions and header validation in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports 're' module and 'builtin_str' from compat; defines regex patterns and constants; function 'to_native_string'; function 'unicode_is_ascii'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written to external systems, no network operations, or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings or bytes) is processed through functions that convert or validate headers, without external data sinks or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed. Functions perform straightforward string and regex operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for HTTP header validation, converting strings between bytes and native string types, and checking ASCII content. It imports minimal dependencies and contains no network or file operations. The functions are utility in nature and do not process untrusted data in a way that could cause harm. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for string and header validation with no malicious or security-compromising behavior. It serves its intended purpose safely.",
