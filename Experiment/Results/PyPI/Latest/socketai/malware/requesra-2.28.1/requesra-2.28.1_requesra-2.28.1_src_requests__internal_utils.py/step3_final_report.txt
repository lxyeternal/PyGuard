  "purpose": "Utility functions for string conversion and header validation within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input strings to 'to_native_string', regex patterns for header validation.",
  "sinks": "The 'decode' method in 'to_native_string' acts as a sink for untrusted data; regex validation is a source of input validation.",
  "flows": "Input strings are decoded in 'to_native_string'; regex patterns validate header names and values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious patterns; standard regex and string operations used.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions for string handling and header validation, with regex patterns that are standard and safe. The 'decode' operation is used cautiously for converting bytes to strings. No external data flows, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The functions do not perform any malicious actions or insecure operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign and utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for internal use, performing standard string and header validation tasks without any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score reflects minimal inherent risk, primarily due to decoding untrusted data, which is acceptable in this context.",
