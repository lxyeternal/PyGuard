  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions for handling strings and validating HTTP headers within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Reads: Imports modules, regex patterns, and functions; data from string parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or external calls that process untrusted data in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "Input strings are checked and transformed locally; no external data flow beyond internal processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Functions perform standard string handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex validators for HTTP headers, a function to convert inputs to native strings, and a function to check ASCII compliance. No external inputs are used insecurely, no external or malicious calls are made. The functions are straightforward utility routines with no evident malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for string handling in the Requests library with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
