{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions for handling string conversions and header validation in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports re module, imports 'builtin_str' from compat module, compiles regex patterns, and reads input strings in functions.",
  "sinks": "None in this code snippet; no untrusted data outputs or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are checked and converted within functions but do not flow into any dangerous sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The regex patterns are standard for header validation. Functions perform safe string operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex validators for HTTP headers, used internally by the requests library, and provides functions for string normalization and ASCII checks. No external data flows, network calls, or insecure operations are present. The code appears to be straightforward utility functions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of utility functions for string handling and header validation. No malicious behavior or security threats are evident.",
