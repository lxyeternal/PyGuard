  "purpose": "Dependency validation, environment setup, and compatibility checks for the requests library, including version assertions and SSL fallback configuration.",
  "sources": "Version strings from imported libraries (urllib3, chardet, charset_normalizer, cryptography), environment detection (ssl), and import statements for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Warnings and assertions that validate dependency versions; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Version strings are checked via assertions; environment detection influences SSL fallback setup; no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for version validation, which could cause runtime termination if dependencies are incompatible; dynamic injection of pyopenssl for SSL fallback.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency checks, version assertions, and environment configuration. Assertions are used to enforce version requirements but could halt execution if dependencies are incompatible. The SSL fallback via pyopenssl is a known pattern for compatibility. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Warnings are used appropriately, and no untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup and validation script for a Python HTTP library, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The reliance on assertions is a minor operational concern but not indicative of malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.",
