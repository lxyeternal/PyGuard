  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup and validation script for a Python HTTP library, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The reliance on assertions is a minor operational concern but not indicative of malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward."
