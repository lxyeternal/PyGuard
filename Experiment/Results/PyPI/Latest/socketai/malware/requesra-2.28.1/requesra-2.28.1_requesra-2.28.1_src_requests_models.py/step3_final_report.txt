  "purpose": "The code implements request and response handling for the Requests library, including URL parsing, header validation, encoding, cookie management, and response iteration.",
  "sources": "URL input, headers, data, files, cookies, hooks, and request parameters.",
  "sinks": "Request body, headers, response content, and cookies.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (URL, headers, data, files, cookies) through request preparation, network transmission, and response processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an HTTP client component. It employs proper encoding, URL validation, error handling, and cookie management. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The response handling includes safe iteration and decoding practices. The overall structure aligns with typical request/response libraries, with no indicators of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate part of the Requests library, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It handles request construction and response parsing securely and transparently. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero.",
