  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for potential issues, and ensure the scoring aligns with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles request/response logic, encoding, URL parsing, cookie management, hooks, and response iteration. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2 — reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Justification:** The report correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects typical request handling complexity, not an inherent vulnerability.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard request/response handling, URL parsing, encoding, and streaming. No suspicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The score aligns with the analysis. No change necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on request/response construction, URL handling, headers, encoding, cookies, and response parsing. No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1 — fitting.\n- **Justification:** Slightly lower risk score, reflecting the code's benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing standard practices and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious code or activity detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scoring is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard request/response handling, encoding, URL parsing, and response processing, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score due to the complexity of request handling, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Check and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently rate malware at 0, and the code contains no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports rate obfuscation at 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 across reports, reflecting the inherent complexity of request handling but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — typical for a request library, but no immediate security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\n- The detailed analysis confirms that the code is standard, secure, and free from malicious or obfuscated patterns.\n- The scores given in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.",
