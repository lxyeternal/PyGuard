  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code in question is a set of straightforward variable assignments defining package metadata (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.).\n- All reports agree that the code is static, contains no input/output processing, no external data handling, and no suspicious or malicious constructs.\n- ASCII art present at the start is purely decorative and harmless.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or security risks are detected in any report.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code is simple metadata assignment; no issues or malicious behavior are present.\n   - All reports correctly identify this as benign.\n\n2. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports — appropriate, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports — appropriate, no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** 0 across all reports — appropriate, no security concerns.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely static metadata, assigning higher scores would be unjustified.\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Malware and Assumptions:**\n   - No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all assessments are cautious and accurate.\n   - No external or dynamic behavior is involved.\n\n6. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- **Should remain at 0.**  \n- No malicious activity, no suspicious code, no external data handling.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- **Should remain at 0.**  \n- No obfuscation present.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- **Should remain at 0.**  \n- No security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The code's purpose is solely to define package metadata, a common and benign pattern.\n- ASCII art is decorative and harmless.\n- No dynamic code, external calls, or sensitive data handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Based on the detailed review, the current scores are appropriate and justified.**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThere is no evidence to warrant any change in the scoring. The code is entirely benign and serves a standard purpose in package setup.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Keep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.  \n- No further action needed.",
