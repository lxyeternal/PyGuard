  "purpose": "Static package metadata declarations for the 'requests' Python library, including descriptive variables and ASCII art.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string and integer variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.) with no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, external calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static assignments without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative ASCII art comments; no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. No dynamic code, input/output, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The ASCII art is purely decorative. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are observed. The scores are consistent with the static, harmless content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign package metadata declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
