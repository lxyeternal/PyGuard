  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments defining metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, email, license, and copyright.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only initializes metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments detected. The code appears to be straightforward metadata assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only variable assignments for package metadata, typical of a Python package's __init__.py or similar setup file. There are no functions, no external input handling, no data processing, and no execution of external commands. It does not include any code that reads input, writes output, or performs network operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard metadata definition for the 'requests' library. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
