{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata for the 'requests' Python HTTP library.",
  "sources": "Reads metadata variables such as __title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, and __cake__.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; only static metadata assignments.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; all assignments are static.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; only static string assignments and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata variable assignments describing the package. There are no input/read operations, no data processing, no network calls, and no dynamic code execution. The comments are decorative ASCII art and do not influence behavior. All variables are statically assigned string or integer values related to package info. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package metadata for the 'requests' library, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and serves only informational purposes.",
