{
  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned with string or integer values (e.g., __title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present; code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code simply initializes metadata variables without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of decorative ASCII art at the start, but no malicious or suspicious code or behavior. All variables are straightforward string assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely assigning metadata variables related to the package, with no input processing, external data retrieval, or malicious constructs. No obfuscated code, no external calls, no credential handling, or suspicious behaviors. The ASCII art is purely decorative and does not affect execution. Overall, the code serves as package metadata definition without any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless metadata declaration for the 'requests' package with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
