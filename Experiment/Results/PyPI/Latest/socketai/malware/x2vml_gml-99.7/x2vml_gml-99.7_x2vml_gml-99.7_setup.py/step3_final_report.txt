{
  "purpose": "The code executes a custom installation step that runs main() from main.py during setup, which poses a security risk.",
  "sources": "The run() method in CrazyInstallStrat imports main from main.py after standard install execution.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() during setup can lead to arbitrary code execution if main.py contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "After standard installation, the code imports main and executes main(), creating a source-to-sink flow during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external code (main()) during installation without validation or safeguards.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, after performing normal installation, imports and runs main() from main.py. This pattern is suspicious because executing external code during setup can be exploited to run malicious code on user systems. The pattern is straightforward but dangerous, especially if main.py is untrusted. The scores assigned in reports (malware up to 0.8, security risk up to 0.9) are justified given the high potential for malicious activity. The absence of obfuscation is noted, and the behavior aligns with high-risk supply chain concerns. The pattern warrants high suspicion and caution, particularly in untrusted contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code's execution of main() during installation is a significant security concern, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. The high malware and risk scores are justified, especially if main.py is malicious. The pattern is suspicious and should be scrutinized further. Overall, the behavior indicates a high-security risk, and the pattern is a common vector for supply chain attacks.",
