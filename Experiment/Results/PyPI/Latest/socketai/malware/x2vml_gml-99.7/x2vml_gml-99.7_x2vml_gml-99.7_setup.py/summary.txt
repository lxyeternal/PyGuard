  "conclusion": "The code's execution of main() during installation is a significant security concern, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. The high malware and risk scores are justified, especially if main.py is malicious. The pattern is suspicious and should be scrutinized further. Overall, the behavior indicates a high-security risk, and the pattern is a common vector for supply chain attacks."
