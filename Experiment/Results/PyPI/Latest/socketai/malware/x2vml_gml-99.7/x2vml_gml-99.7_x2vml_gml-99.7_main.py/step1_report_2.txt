  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to remote URLs with query parameters containing system info and a random number",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current path) and a random number are collected and sent via HTTP GET requests to remote servers",
  "anomalies": "The URLs point to suspicious domains, and the code sends system info to these URLs without user consent or obvious purpose; no validation or encryption is applied",
  "analysis": "The script gathers host name, username, current directory, and generates a random number. It then constructs URLs with these parameters and attempts to fetch data from them, logging responses or errors. The URLs are suspicious and appear to be designed to exfiltrate data. The code uses standard libraries without obfuscation but communicates with untrusted external servers, potentially for malicious data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for malicious data exfiltration or surveillance, sending system info to suspicious domains without user consent. It does not perform any malicious actions directly on the system but communicates with potentially malicious servers, indicating a security risk.",
