  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior indicative of covert data exfiltration to untrusted domains. While it lacks active payloads or obfuscation, its pattern of sending system info without user consent is malicious in intent. The high malware and security risk scores are justified, and the overall assessment indicates a high potential threat."
