  "flows": "System info (hostname, user, path) -> URL parameters -> HTTP GET requests to remote servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious URLs with obfuscated domain patterns, no validation or sanitization of data, use of hardcoded URLs, and sending data over GET requests to untrusted domains.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, current directory, and a random number. It constructs URLs with these parameters and makes HTTP GET requests to external servers. The URLs are obscure and could be used for tracking or exfiltration of system info. No user input is used, but system info is sent to potentially malicious domains, indicating possible data leakage or tracking. The URLs are suspicious, and the data is transmitted unencrypted via GET requests, which is insecure and potentially malicious. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present beyond data exfiltration. The code appears designed to collect and send system data covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The script gathers system details and transmits them to suspicious external URLs without user consent, indicating malicious intent for tracking or data exfiltration. It is likely malicious given the suspicious domains and data collection pattern.",
