  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple external URLs with dynamic parameters.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint(), URLs in the list.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current path) + random number flows from sources to URL parameters, then transmitted over network via urlopen.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs pointing to suspicious or untrusted domains; sending system information to external servers; no visible user consent or transparency; dynamic URL construction with encoded parameters.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system hostname, username, and current working directory, then generates a random number. It constructs three URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to each. The domains used are suspicious and appear malicious or untrusted, indicating potential data exfiltration. The code does not validate the URLs nor does it inform the user, suggesting malicious intent. No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are present, but the purpose appears to be covert data collection and transmission to malicious domains.",
  "conclusion": "The code attempts to stealthily collect and transmit system information to external suspicious domains, indicating malicious intent and potential data exfiltration. The code does not contain obfuscation but uses suspicious URLs and active network communication. It should be considered malicious with a high security risk.",
