{
  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to multiple remote URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), and current working directory (os.getcwd()).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests to external URLs with embedded system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System information sources are encoded into URLs and transmitted via HTTP requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple suspicious URLs with unusual domain names, including 'oast' and 'cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', which may be malicious or used for data collection. The code gathers system info and sends it without user consent or obvious purpose. The use of random numbers in URL paths suggests obfuscation or tracking. No input validation or user interaction is present; the URLs are hardcoded. The URL pattern resembles command and control or tracking behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code collects host information such as hostname, username, and current directory, then constructs URLs pointing to seemingly suspicious domains. It sends GET requests with these parameters without user notification or control, indicating potential data exfiltration. The URLs' domain names and the pattern of data collection suggest malicious intent, likely for tracking or covert data collection. The code does not perform any harmful system modifications but could be part of a larger malicious payload or supply chain attack. The use of random integers in URL paths might be to evade detection or associate requests uniquely.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to perform covert data collection by sending system details to external domains. While it does not execute malicious payloads directly, its behavior is suspicious and aligns with tracking or exfiltration activities, which could be malicious depending on context. It warrants caution and further investigation for malicious intent.",
