      "conclusion": "The code's execution of main() during installation is a significant security concern, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. The high malware and risk scores are justified, especially if main.py is malicious. The pattern is suspicious and should be scrutinized further. Overall, the behavior indicates a high-security risk, and the pattern is a common vector for supply chain attacks."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior indicative of covert data exfiltration to untrusted domains. While it lacks active payloads or obfuscation, its pattern of sending system info without user consent is malicious in intent. The high malware and security risk scores are justified, and the overall assessment indicates a high potential threat."
