      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating user system information during installation without consent, representing a serious supply chain security threat. The high malware (0.9) and risk (0.9) scores are justified. The code is not obfuscated, and the activity is clearly malicious. All reports correctly identify this behavior, and the scores are appropriate."
