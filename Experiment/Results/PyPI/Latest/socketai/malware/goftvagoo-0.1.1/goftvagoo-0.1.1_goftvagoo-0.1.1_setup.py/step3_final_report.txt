{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the setup process to collect system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during installation and exfiltrates this data to a remote server via an HTTP GET request.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external IP address 192.198.82.14:3000/log",
  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> requests.get() with these parameters",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration during package installation without user consent; hardcoded suspicious IP; no obfuscation or encryption",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, after executing the standard installation, collects system info and sends it to a hardcoded IP address. This behavior is suspicious and aligns with malicious supply chain tactics. The code is straightforward, un-obfuscated, and performs data exfiltration stealthily during installation. The IP address is suspicious, and the activity indicates potential privacy violation or surveillance. The high malware and security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified by this malicious exfiltration activity. The code does not contain obfuscation or payloads beyond data collection and transmission. The behavior is consistent across reports, and the scores reflect the severity accurately.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating user system information during installation without consent, representing a serious supply chain security threat. The high malware (0.9) and risk (0.9) scores are justified. The code is not obfuscated, and the activity is clearly malicious. All reports correctly identify this behavior, and the scores are appropriate.",
