{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup script that includes a custom installation command to collect system information and send it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The code sends data via an HTTP GET request to a remote server at 192.198.82.14:3000/log using the requests library.",
  "flows": "The system information is collected during the custom install run method and then transmitted over the network to the specified IP address.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a hardcoded IP address that appears suspicious; the data transmission occurs during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior. The comment '# Dependency Confusion POC' suggests awareness of supply chain attack techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the standard setup process by adding a custom install class that, upon execution, gathers system information and sends it to a remote server. This behavior indicates data exfiltration during package installation. The use of requests to perform network communication during installation, combined with hardcoded IP, suggests malicious intent or at least a privacy violation. There are no other suspicious or malicious code snippets like code injection, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The overall behavior resembles a supply chain attack or privacy compromise attempt.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a potentially malicious action by exfiltrating system data during package installation without user consent. This behavior indicates malicious intent, aligning with supply chain attack tactics. It should be considered dangerous and unsuitable for use.",
