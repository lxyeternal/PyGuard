  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation step that sends system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), requests.get()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() (sending data to external IP address)",
  "flows": "Collects hostname, current working directory, username -> sends data via HTTP GET request to external server",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits system information to an IP address during installation, which is suspicious behavior. No use of environment variables or other input sources; the data exfiltration is hidden within the install process.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard libraries to gather hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data to a hardcoded external IP during package installation. This pattern indicates potential malicious activity such as data exfiltration. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are evident beyond this network activity. The code may be attempting dependency confusion or supply chain manipulation by stealthily collecting user data.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an unauthorized data exfiltration during package installation, which is malicious. It appears designed to collect and send user system info to an external server without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
