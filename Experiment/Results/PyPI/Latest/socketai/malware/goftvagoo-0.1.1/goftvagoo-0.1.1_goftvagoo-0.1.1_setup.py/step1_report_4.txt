{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation command that collects system information and sends it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during the custom install process.",
  "sinks": "The collected data is sent via an HTTP GET request to a remote server (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log).",
  "flows": "Source: system information variables (hostname, cwd, username) -> sink: requests.get call sending data to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes collecting system info and transmitting it during package installation, which is not typical for a normal setup process; the IP address used is suspicious and indicates potential data exfiltration or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and additional modules, then defines a custom installation class. During installation, it gathers system details—hostname, current working directory, and username—and sends these details to a remote server via an HTTP GET request. This behavior resembles a supply chain attack vector where user data is silently transmitted during package installation. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present beyond this data exfiltration. The IP address used is not associated with known benign services, raising suspicion about malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary malicious aspect is the silent collection and transmission of system data to an external server during package installation. This is indicative of malicious behavior aimed at spying or data exfiltration, classified as a supply chain security threat. No other malicious code or malware indicators are evident, but the data exfiltration itself poses significant security concerns.",
