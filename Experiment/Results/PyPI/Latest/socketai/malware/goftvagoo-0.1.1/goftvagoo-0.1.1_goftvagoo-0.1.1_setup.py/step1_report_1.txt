{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect and exfiltrate system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The information is sent via an HTTP GET request to a remote IP address, which could be used for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, cwd, username) -> requests.get() request to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects system information and transmits it to an external IP during installation, indicating potential data exfiltration. The IP address is hardcoded and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the setuptools install command to include a step that collects hostname, current working directory, and username. These details are then sent to a fixed IP address via an HTTP GET request. This behavior suggests malicious intent, as it exfiltrates user system information without user consent during package installation. There are no obfuscated elements or benign reasons for this behavior, and it appears to be an intentional data leakage mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior where system information is secretly sent to an external server during installation. This is indicative of supply chain attack behavior, potentially for tracking or data theft purposes. The hardcoded IP and data collection make it suspicious and dangerous.",
