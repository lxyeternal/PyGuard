{
  "purpose": "The code defines type aliases and type variables for a Python web framework, likely for type checking and documentation purposes related to HTTP responses and application lifecycle hooks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily from type annotations, imported modules, and class/type references within the source itself.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, code execution, or other security effects. No network or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "The code sets up type flows for functions that return or process HTTP response data, but does not implement any runtime logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard type alias and variable declarations; no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are detected. No malicious behavior or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations and imports for type checking, including unions and generics for HTTP response types, headers, and application hooks. It imports from __future__ to support annotations, which is standard for forward references. The type variables and aliases facilitate static type checking for web framework components, such as Flask or Werkzeug. No runtime logic, user input handling, or network operations are present. The code appears well-structured and intended for type safety without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type alias definitions and imports used for static type checking in a web framework context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a standard pattern for type annotations, and no suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.",
