  "sources": "Type annotations, import statements, conditional imports under TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input handling, or runtime data flows.",
  "flows": "None; static type definitions without data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static type aliasing with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions, imports, and comments for static type checking. There is no runtime logic, data handling, or dynamic code execution. No untrusted data sources or sinks are present. The code serves as static annotations for Flask/Werkzeug components, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. All signals indicate benign, static type setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of static type annotations with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments and scores indicating malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate at 0. The high confidence score reflects certainty in this benign evaluation.",
