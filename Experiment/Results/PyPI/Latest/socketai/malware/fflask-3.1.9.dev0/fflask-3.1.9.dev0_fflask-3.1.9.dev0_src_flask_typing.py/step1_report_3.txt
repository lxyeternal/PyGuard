{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations for various components used in a web framework, likely Flask or Werkzeug, to facilitate static type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and imports; no external data input sources or untrusted data reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network, file, or system command execution are present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input; the code strictly defines types and no runtime data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual or suspicious logic; it is a standard type annotation module with no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively consists of type definitions, import statements, and comments explaining type annotations. There are no functions, data processing, or runtime logic that could be malicious. All imports are from standard or well-known libraries, and no external input or output is handled. The purpose appears to be static type checking support for a web framework, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical type annotation module for a web framework, with no signs of malware, security threats, or malicious behavior. It is a safe and standard component focused solely on static typing.",
