{
  "purpose": "Type alias definitions for a web framework, primarily for request and response handling, including type annotations for various HTTP-related constructs and callbacks.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and import statements at the beginning; type definitions throughout the code.",
  "targets": "No explicit data input/output operations; type annotations are used for static type checking only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code defines types but does not process runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type definitions and imports necessary for static type checking in a web framework context (likely Flask or Werkzeug). There are no runtime data inputs, no data processing, no external calls, and no dynamic execution. The import statements are standard, and the type aliases are descriptive of HTTP constructs. No indicators of malicious intent or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a legitimate type annotation module for a web framework, designed to improve static analysis and type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type annotations and imports for a web framework, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely structural and static, intended for type checking purposes.",
