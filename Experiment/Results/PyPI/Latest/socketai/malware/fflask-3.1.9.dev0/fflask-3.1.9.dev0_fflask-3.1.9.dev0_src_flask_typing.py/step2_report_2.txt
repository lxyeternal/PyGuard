  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is solely for static type annotations, importing types and defining unions for response types, headers, and callbacks.  \n- **Security & Malware:** No dynamic code, data processing, or untrusted input handling. No potential for malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **reasonable**.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly states that the code is for type annotations, with no runtime logic or data handling.  \n- **Security & Malware:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **appropriate**.  \n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report emphasizes that the code is purely for static type checking, with no runtime data processing or security concerns.  \n- **Security & Malware:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **appropriate**.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same conclusion: static type definitions, no runtime or untrusted data handling.  \n- **Security & Malware:** No issues found.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **reasonable**.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Consistent with previous assessments, the code is a straightforward static type alias module.  \n- **Security & Malware:** No malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **appropriate**.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious activity. The code is purely for static type annotations, with no runtime or data processing involved.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; the code is clear and standard for type definitions.  \n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is solely for static typing and contains no runtime logic, the risk score should remain at **0** across all reports.  \n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate given the nature of the code.  \n- No changes are necessary.  \n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk associated with static type annotations.  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, standard set of type annotations for a Flask/Werkzeug project, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
