{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and type aliases for a web application framework, likely Flask or Werkzeug, to facilitate type checking and clarity in code that handles HTTP responses, headers, and application lifecycle hooks.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from type annotations and type aliases, primarily in the form of type hints for function signatures, including Response objects, headers, and application hooks.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this code; no data is processed or outputted. The code primarily defines types without executing any runtime operations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows are present; the code only defines type annotations for expected data structures and callable signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is purely type annotation definitions with no operational logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides comprehensive type aliasing and Union definitions for various response and hook types used in a web framework, enhancing static type checking. There are no runtime operations, data processing, or security-sensitive actions. It imports standard typing modules and conditionally imports types for type checking purposes only. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured type definitions module with no malicious or suspicious components.",
  "conclusion": "This code is solely for type annotations and does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves as a static type hinting aid in a web application framework. No security concerns are identified.",
