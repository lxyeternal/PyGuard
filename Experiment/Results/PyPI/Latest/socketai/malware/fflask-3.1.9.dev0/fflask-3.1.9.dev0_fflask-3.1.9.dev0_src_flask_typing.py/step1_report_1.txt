  "purpose": "Define type aliases and type variables for Flask and Werkzeug HTTP framework integrations, including response types, headers, callbacks, and route handling.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, type checking imports, and variable definitions for response types, headers, and callback functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute or process untrusted data directly. The code mainly defines type aliases and type variables for static type checking.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input leading to dangerous operations. The code primarily sets up typing structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for compatibility and type hints for Flask/Werkzeug components. It defines union types for responses, headers, and callback functions used in web applications. No dynamic code execution, no data processing, and no potential input sources or sinks are present. The code functions solely as type annotations for static analysis, with no runtime or malicious behavior. Overall, it appears as standard typing setup code for a Flask/Werkzeug project.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely related to static type annotations and setup for Flask/Werkzeug frameworks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It serves as a type definition module for a web application framework.",
