  "purpose": "Provides various utility functions and custom exceptions for handling request errors, debugging, and template loading diagnostics in a Flask-like web application framework.",
  "sources": "Request input data via request.files, request.form, request.url, request.mimetype, request.base_url, request.blueprint; data passed into functions such as app, request, loader, and attempt details.",
  "sinks": "Error message construction and raising exceptions; logging info; modifying request.files.__class__",
  "flows": "Request data read from request.files and request.form → exception handling or error reporting functions; loader info generation and logging → explain_template_loading_attempts → debug/info logs",
  "anomalies": "Use of class patching to override request.files.__getitem__; detailed exception messages for debugging; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious external calls; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines custom exceptions and utility functions for error handling, debugging, and template loading diagnostics. It patches request.files.__getitem__ to provide clearer error messages for missing files, which is a standard debugging aid. The functions generate diagnostic information about template loading attempts, aiding developers in troubleshooting template resolution issues. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The exception messages are informative and relevant to debugging. Overall, the code is well-structured for development support, with no suspicious or malicious activity evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a debugging and error-reporting utility for a Flask-like web framework. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious external interactions, and no obfuscated or harmful code. Its purpose is to assist developers in diagnosing issues with request data and template loading. The code is safe and does not pose security risks.",
