  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines a custom Flask Blueprint class with static file serving, resource opening, and configuration access. No suspicious or malicious code is present.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code uses standard patterns; no external network calls, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The low risk score is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static file serving and resource access with no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies the code as standard, with no external network or malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a Flask-like Blueprint extension with static and resource management, no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no external threats or malicious patterns.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar standard resource and static file handling, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The code is typical for web frameworks, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard resource management with no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the other reports; no issues detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe the same or very similar code snippets—custom Flask Blueprints for static file serving and resource access.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal risk, mainly due to filesystem access based on parameters, which is standard and controlled in the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the filesystem access based on parameters, a small but non-zero risk score (around 0.1–0.2) is justified, consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is standard, well-structured, and does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\nThis concludes the review.",
