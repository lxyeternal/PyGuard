{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom Blueprint class for Flask applications, extending functionality for static files and resource management.",
  "sources": "Configuration value 'SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT' from current_app.config, file paths from parameters in methods.",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory function call, open() function for reading files.",
  "flows": "Configuration value flow from current_app.config to get_send_file_max_age, filename parameter flow into send_from_directory, resource path construction in open_resource.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. Usage of open() for reading files is standard, with input paths controlled by application logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages static file serving, resource opening, and blueprint setup within a Flask extension. No untrusted input sources are evident outside method parameters. 'current_app.config' is used for configuration; no direct external input. The method 'send_static_file' relies on static_folder attribute which should be safe as it is set during class initialization. File opening in 'open_resource' checks for mode correctness and constructs paths based on 'root_path', which is a class attribute. No evidence of malicious code injection, backdoors, or suspicious external communications. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or contain hidden backdoors. No obfuscated code, cryptic logic, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard extension for Flask Blueprints to manage static files and resources. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. No malware or malicious intents are evident.",
