{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Blueprint class for a Flask-like web framework, extending functionality for static file serving, resource opening, and CLI command registration.",
  "sources": "Configuration access via current_app.config; static file handling functions; resource file access; class initialization parameters",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory function for static file delivery; open method for reading resource files",
  "flows": "Configuration values from current_app.config -> get_send_file_max_age; filename parameter -> send_from_directory; resource path + mode -> open resource files",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be standard Flask extension code with no suspicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a custom Blueprint class, inheriting from SansioBlueprint, adding methods for static file serving and resource access. It accesses configuration settings securely via current_app.config and properly manages resource file paths. The send_static_file method calls send_from_directory with validated parameters. No user input is directly used in security-sensitive functions. There are no signs of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior. Overall, the code looks well-structured, with no suspicious anomalies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard framework extension code with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It properly manages static and resource files, and relies on secure configuration access. No malware or security threats are detected.",
