  "purpose": "Defines a custom Flask Blueprint extension for static files and resources management, including serving static files, opening resource files, and handling cache control based on configuration.",
  "sources": "Configuration value 'SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT', filename and resource parameters, filesystem paths.",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory function, open() filesystem calls.",
  "flows": "Configuration influences cache max age; filename/resource parameters flow into filesystem functions for serving files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Flask extension for resource and static file handling. It uses configuration values and filesystem operations securely. No external network calls, malicious logic, or obfuscation are present. The filesystem access is controlled, and no secrets are hardcoded. The code structure and purpose are clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Flask extension for static and resource management with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
