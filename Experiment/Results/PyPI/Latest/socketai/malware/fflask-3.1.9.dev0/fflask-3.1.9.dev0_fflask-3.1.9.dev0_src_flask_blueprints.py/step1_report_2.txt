{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Blueprint class for a web application, extending functionality for static file handling, resource opening, and configuration management within a Flask-like framework.",
  "sources": "Configuration access via current_app.config, input parameters such as filename, resource, mode, and optional parameters for resource opening.",
  "sinks": "File operations through open(), send_from_directory(), and access to configuration values that influence behavior.",
  "flows": "Configuration values influence cache behavior; filename and resource parameters are used directly in file operations; data flows from parameters into file system operations and response objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external network calls are present. Usage of os.path.join and open is standard for resource access. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for serving static files and opening resources within a Flask blueprint context. It retrieves configuration values to determine cache expiration and serves files from specified directories. No external network interactions, data exfiltration, or malicious code snippets are found. The resource handling enforces read-only modes, and static file serving is controlled with appropriate error handling. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of blueprint extensions for static file serving and resource management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as part of a typical web framework setup.",
