{
  "purpose": "Defines a Blueprint class for Flask-like application modularization, handling static files, resource opening, and configuration retrieval.",
  "sources": "Imports standard modules (os, typing, datetime) and internal modules (.cli, .globals, .helpers, .sansio.blueprints). Uses current_app.config to get configuration values.",
  "sinks": "Open file operations (open), send_from_directory, and current_app.config access.",
  "flows": "Configuration values from current_app.config flow into get_send_file_max_age. Filename parameters flow into send_static_file and open_resource, ultimately reaching filesystem operations. send_from_directory receives static_folder and filename. open_resource reads files from disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Flask-inspired Blueprint class with methods to serve static files, determine cache max-age, and open resource files. It relies on configuration values for cache control and performs filesystem operations to open files. The logic appears standard for web framework functionalities. No data leaks, external network connections, or malicious data handling observed. The code structure and content are typical for web server setup modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of a Flask-like blueprint system for static file serving and resource management. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security threats detected.",
