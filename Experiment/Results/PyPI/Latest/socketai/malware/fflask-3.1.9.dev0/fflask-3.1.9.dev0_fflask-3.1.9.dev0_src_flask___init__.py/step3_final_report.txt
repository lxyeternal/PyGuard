{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an import aggregator or initializer module, re-exporting components from internal packages for a web framework, likely Flask.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules such as .app, .blueprints, .config, .ctx, .globals, .helpers, .signals, .templating, and .wrappers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules without data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements importing various components of a web framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or risky operations. The import pattern is typical for a package's __init__.py or similar module meant to expose internal components. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is clean, readable, and standard for such use cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
