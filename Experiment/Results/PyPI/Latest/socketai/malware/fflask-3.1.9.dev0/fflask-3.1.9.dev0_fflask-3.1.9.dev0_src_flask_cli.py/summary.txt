  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate Flask CLI utility with moderate security risks stemming from dynamic import and evaluation patterns. No malicious code or obfuscation is detected. Proper validation of user inputs and restricting module/function names to trusted sources can mitigate risks. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.5, reflecting the potential for code execution in untrusted scenarios."
