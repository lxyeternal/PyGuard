  "purpose": "This script provides CLI commands for managing Flask applications, including app discovery, environment setup, server execution, and route inspection.",
  "sources": "User CLI options, environment variables, dynamic module and function imports, configuration files, and environment files.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable modifications, dynamic import and execution of modules/functions, server startup, app context management.",
  "flows": "User inputs influence module paths and function calls via dynamic import and eval, environment variables are loaded from files, and functions are invoked based on user commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import_string', 'ast.literal_eval', and dynamic import patterns which could execute malicious code if inputs are untrusted; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code heavily relies on dynamic import and evaluation based on user input, which introduces potential security risks if inputs are malicious. It employs safe parsing ('ast.literal_eval') but still allows execution of arbitrary modules/functions specified by the user. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present, and the code is well-structured and transparent. The primary concern is the potential for code execution if untrusted inputs are supplied, especially via module paths or function calls. The environment variable loading and app discovery mechanisms are standard for CLI tools but should be used cautiously in untrusted environments.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate Flask CLI utility with moderate security risks stemming from dynamic import and evaluation patterns. No malicious code or obfuscation is detected. Proper validation of user inputs and restricting module/function names to trusted sources can mitigate risks. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.5, reflecting the potential for code execution in untrusted scenarios.",
