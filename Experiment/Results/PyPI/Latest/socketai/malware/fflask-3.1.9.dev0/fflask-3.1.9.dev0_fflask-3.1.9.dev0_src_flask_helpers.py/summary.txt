  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Flask utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low scores for malware (0), obfuscation (0), and risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified. External validation of user inputs, especially file paths, remains essential but is outside the scope of this code. Overall, it is safe and appropriate for use."
