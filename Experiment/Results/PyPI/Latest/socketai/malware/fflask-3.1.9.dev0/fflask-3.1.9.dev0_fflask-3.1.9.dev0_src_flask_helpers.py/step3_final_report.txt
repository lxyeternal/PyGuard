  "purpose": "Utility functions for Flask applications, including response creation, URL generation, file serving, message flashing, and environment variable handling.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., FLASK_DEBUG, FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV), request context, session data, user input in file paths (send_file, send_from_directory).",
  "sinks": "Response objects, redirect functions, abort calls, file responses, URL building, flashed message storage.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence configuration flags; user input (file paths, URL parameters) flow into file serving and URL generation functions; session and request globals provide context for flashing and response handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious external connections. Use of user input in file paths is standard but requires external validation to prevent path traversal.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard Flask utility functions that manage responses, URL building, static file serving, and message flashing. It relies on environment variables for configuration and uses request/session globals appropriately. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The use of Werkzeug's secure functions (like send_from_directory) mitigates common risks related to user-supplied file paths. The environment variable handling is straightforward and safe. Overall, the code is typical for Flask applications and does not contain malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Flask utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low scores for malware (0), obfuscation (0), and risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified. External validation of user inputs, especially file paths, remains essential but is outside the scope of this code. Overall, it is safe and appropriate for use.",
