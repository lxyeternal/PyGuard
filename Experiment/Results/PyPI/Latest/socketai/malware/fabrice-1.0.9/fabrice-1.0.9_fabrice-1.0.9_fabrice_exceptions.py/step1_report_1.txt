{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling related to group processing and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; purely class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external calls.",
  "flows": "No data flows; no execution logic beyond class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class definitions for custom exceptions with descriptive docstrings. No input/output operations, network access, or dynamic execution present. No signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a standard, benign setup for exception handling in a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of exception class definitions for managing specific error scenarios, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is straightforward and typical for a Python codebase.",
