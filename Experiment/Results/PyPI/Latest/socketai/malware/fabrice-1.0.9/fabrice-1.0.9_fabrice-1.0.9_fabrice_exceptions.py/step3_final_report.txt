  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with no external data input, output, or dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code contains three simple exception classes with no logic, data processing, or external calls. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. Comments suggest potential refactoring but do not impact security. The code is standard for error handling in Python projects and does not perform any operations that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
