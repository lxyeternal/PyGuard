  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; the code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data or untrusted input is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs, as the code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions. No external data handling, security-sensitive operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The classes are straightforward, with no suspicious logic or behavior. The comments and structure do not indicate malicious intent or obfuscation. The purpose appears to be standard error handling within a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes without any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no security risks identified in this fragment.",
