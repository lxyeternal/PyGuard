  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios in a Python application, possibly related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data is handled internally through exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior. The comment indicates potential future code refactoring but does not affect current functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions, which are standard and straightforward. No input handling, data processing, or external communication occurs. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs are present. The comment suggests ongoing development considerations but does not introduce malicious intent. Overall, this appears to be standard code for custom exception handling without any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines simple custom exceptions without any malicious behavior or security risks. There are no sources or sinks involved, and no anomalies detected. It is typical application code for error handling.",
