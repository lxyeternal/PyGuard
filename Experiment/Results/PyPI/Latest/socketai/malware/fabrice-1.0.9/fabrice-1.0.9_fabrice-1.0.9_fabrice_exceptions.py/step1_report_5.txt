  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions in a Python project, likely related to task management or environment configuration.",
  "sources": "No external data input or untrusted data sources; exception classes are defined statically.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; exception classes do not perform data transmission or risky operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; classes only define error types without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be straightforward class definitions without obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The comment suggests potential future refactoring but does not impact security.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with no logic or data processing. The comments indicate possible future modifications, but currently, there are no signs of malicious activity. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and only provides custom exceptions for error handling purposes. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified.",
