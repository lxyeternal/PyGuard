  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling and potential environment validation within a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and comments, no data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow exists as the code solely declares exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions with no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions for custom exceptions: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. These are typical in Python projects for managing error states. The comments suggest some planning or refactoring considerations but do not implement any logic that could be malicious. No input/output handling, data leaks, or code execution mechanisms are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices for defining exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of exception class definitions without any malicious intent or security concerns. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are detected.",
