  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for SSH and command execution functionalities. It contains no malware, backdoors, or malicious intent. The environment-dependent controls and test credentials are acceptable within a testing context. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2)."
