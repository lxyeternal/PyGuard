  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a set of automation tasks with insecure practices (hardcoded secrets). It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. The main security concern is the exposure of credentials and environment configurations, which could be exploited if the code is publicly accessible. The overall security risk is moderate, approximately 0.45, reflecting the potential for secret leaks but no active malicious activity."
