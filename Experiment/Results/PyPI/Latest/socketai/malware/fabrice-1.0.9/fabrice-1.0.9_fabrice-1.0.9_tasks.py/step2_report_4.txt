  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes build, release, testing, and docs tasks.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, local paths, hardcoded credentials.\n- **Sinks:** Environment variables, configuration objects.\n- **Flow:** Environment variables influence logic; hardcoded secrets set into configs.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded passwords ('sikrit'), gateway URL ('some-gateway'), sys.path manipulation.\n- **Analysis:** No malware or malicious behavior, but presence of hardcoded secrets and environment manipulation. The code is straightforward, serving CI/CD purposes.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign but insecure practices.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.45 (reasonable given insecure practices but no malicious intent)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar build/test automation.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, sys.path changes, hardcoded credentials.\n- **Sinks:** Subprocess commands, environment configs.\n- **Flow:** Environment variables and sys.path influence behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded credentials ('sikrit', 'sudouser', 'mypass'), sys.path removal.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious payloads, but insecure practices with secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware, but insecure credential handling.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.4 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build, test, release automation.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, task args.\n- **Sinks:** Commands, environment variables.\n- **Flow:** Configuration influenced by environment variables.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded credentials ('sikrit', 'travis' user/password).\n- **Analysis:** No malware or malicious activity, just insecure secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Similar to previous, insecure but benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.3 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build/test/release tasks.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, hardcoded secrets ('sikrit', 'some-gateway', 'travis' credentials).\n- **Sinks:** Shell commands, network connections.\n- **Flow:** Uses secrets for configuration.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets, potential exposure risk.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious payloads, but insecure handling of secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Insecure practices, but no malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.6 (slightly higher, reflecting more sensitive data exposure)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Automation for build/test/deploy.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, hardcoded credentials ('sikrit', 'localghost', 'admin', 'mypass').\n- **Sinks:** Shell commands, network connections.\n- **Flow:** Credentials influence connection setup.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets, typical in CI configs but insecure.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just insecure secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Moderate security risk due to secrets, no malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.3 (appropriate)\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the absence of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Varying from 0.3 to 0.6, reflecting the presence of hardcoded secrets and environment manipulation.\n\n**Overall, the scores across reports are consistent and justified.** The primary concern is insecure handling of secrets, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** Given the repeated presence of hardcoded secrets, I would assign a slightly higher overall risk score, around **0.4 to 0.5**, considering the potential for accidental exposure.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- The current scores are reasonable and align with the analysis.  \n- The main security concern is the insecure handling of secrets, not malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is primarily benign automation with insecure practices (hardcoded secrets). No malware or obfuscation detected. The risk scores are appropriate, though slightly conservative. It would be prudent to recommend removing hardcoded secrets and using secure environment management.\n\n---",
