{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a package's __init__.py file, importing various modules and classes for exposing a public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: ._version, .connection, .runners, .group, .tasks, .executor",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network or file operations, no data processing or output functions",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only imports modules and classes without data flow logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports components from submodules, which is typical for package initialization. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or network activity. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present. The code structure is straightforward and standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer that imports modules for public API exposure. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
