  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of import statements from internal modules.\n   - No report indicates any actual code execution, data processing, or network activity.\n   - Confirmed: The code is a standard module initialization or __init__.py file, with no malicious code or vulnerabilities present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data sinks, flows, anomalies, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero or negligible, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), which is appropriate given the straightforward import statements.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely import statements with no runtime logic, data handling, or network activity, the risk scores should remain at zero.\n   - Any higher score would be unjustified and would overstate the risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware scores are zero across all reports.\n   - This is correct, as there is no malicious activity, code injection, or backdoor behavior present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the absence of suspicious activity.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation techniques observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (negligible security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, benign module import setup, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, there is no security concern. The code is standard and safe.",
