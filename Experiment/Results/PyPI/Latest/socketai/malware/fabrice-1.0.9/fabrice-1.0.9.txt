      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a set of automation tasks with insecure practices (hardcoded secrets). It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. The main security concern is the exposure of credentials and environment configurations, which could be exploited if the code is publicly accessible. The overall security risk is moderate, approximately 0.45, reflecting the potential for secret leaks but no active malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with standard practices. The only minor concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which can be mitigated by securing the '_version.py' file. No malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The current security scores are appropriate, reflecting low risk, with the main caveat being the exec() pattern."
