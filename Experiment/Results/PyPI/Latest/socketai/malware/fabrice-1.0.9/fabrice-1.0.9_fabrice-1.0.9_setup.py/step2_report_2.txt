  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, the reasoning behind the scores, and the consistency of the reported findings.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package.\n- The primary concern raised is the use of `exec()` to load version info from `_version.py`.\n- No evidence of network activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code is identified.\n- The environment variable and filesystem checks are typical for package variants.\n- The overall security risk scores are low (around 0.2), which aligns with the cautious stance on executing external code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- The use of `exec()` on `_version.py` is a common pattern but could be risky if `_version.py` is tampered with. This is acknowledged in all reports.\n- No other code in the script appears malicious or suspicious.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n\n- The reports correctly identify `exec()` as a potential concern but also recognize it as a common pattern in setup scripts.\n- They correctly note that no malicious activity is evident, and the code is standard for packaging.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate given no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly higher (0.2) due to the `exec()` usage, which is reasonable. No reason to increase it further unless `_version.py` is compromised.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign scores above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The `exec()` call is a potential vector if `_version.py` is malicious, but in a typical setup environment, this is considered low risk unless there's evidence of tampering.\n\n### Consistency with the reports:\n\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment: the code is standard, with a minor concern over `exec()`.\n- No contradictions or unreasonable score assignments are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.2** — reflects the cautious stance due to `exec()`, but overall low risk.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — due to `exec()` pattern, but not inherently malicious.\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of the reports and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe setup script is standard, with the only minor concern being the use of `exec()` to load version info. No malicious activity or indicators of supply chain compromise are present. The current scoring is appropriate, and I agree with the assessments provided.",
