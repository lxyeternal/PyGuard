  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package.\n- The primary concern raised is the use of `exec()` to load version info from `_version.py`.\n- No reports mention network activity, hardcoded secrets, or other malicious behaviors.\n- The environment variable `PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2` and directory checks are standard for conditional package configuration.\n- The scores assigned are mostly low, reflecting the minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Presence\n\n- The code indeed reads environment variables, checks for directories, reads `_version.py`, and uses `exec()` to load version info.\n- The `exec()` call is used solely to assign `__version__`, a common pattern but one that could be risky if `_version.py` is compromised.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes\n\n- No logical errors or malicious code are evident.\n- The use of `exec()` is standard but should be noted as a potential risk if the `_version.py` file is tampered with.\n\n### Score Justifications\n\n- **Malware Score (0):** No malicious activity detected; no network activity, no code injection beyond version loading.\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk (0.2):** Slightly elevated due to `exec()` usage, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts. The risk is minimal if the `_version.py` file is secure.\n\n### Potential Assumptions and Claims\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the only potentially risky part is the `exec()` on `_version.py`.\n- No claims of malicious intent are supported by the code itself.\n\n### Recommendations on Scores\n\n- The assigned scores seem reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n**Rationale:** The script is a typical setup script with a standard pattern for version loading. The only concern is the `exec()` call, which is common but should be used cautiously. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain compromise.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe code is benign, with a minor concern about executing external code for version info. Ensuring the `_version.py` file is secure and tamper-proof mitigates this risk.\n\n**Overall, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's actual behavior.",
