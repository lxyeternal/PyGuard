{
  "purpose": "The code is executing dynamically decoded and decompressed data, likely to run obfuscated payload or malicious script.",
  "sources": "Reading data from base64 decoding (__import__('base64').b64decode) and zlib decompression (__import__('zlib').decompress).",
  "sinks": "exec() function, which executes the resulting string as Python code.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoding and zlib decompression produce a payload, which is then executed via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple import() calls for base64 and zlib, combined with exec on decoded data, indicating obfuscation and potential malicious intent. The payload is highly obfuscated and compressed, hiding its true nature.",
  "analysis": "The code imports base64 and zlib modules to decode and decompress a large blob of data. This blob is a compressed base64-encoded string. After decoding and decompressing, the data is passed directly to exec(), which executes it as Python code. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent, such as hiding malware payloads or backdoors. The pattern is typical for malware loaders or dropper scripts designed to evade static analysis and run hidden malicious code at runtime.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious due to its obfuscated nature, use of dynamic execution, and data decoding/decompression. It likely executes malicious code concealed within the payload. The overall security risk is high, and the code should be considered malicious until further analysis confirms otherwise.",
