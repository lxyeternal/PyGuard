  "purpose": "The code dynamically decodes and decompresses data, then executes it as Python code.",
  "sources": "Base64 decoding (__import__('base64').b64decode) and zlib decompression (__import__('zlib').decompress).",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing the decoded code, which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Decoding and decompressing data -> passing result to exec() -> execution of arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with dynamically decoded data, obfuscated data, and combined base64 and zlib operations; no visible code logic or comments; obfuscated payload.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing base64 and zlib modules. It then decodes a base64 string that is also compressed with zlib, resulting in potentially executable Python code. This code is immediately run via exec(). The obfuscation and combination of decoding, decompression, and immediate execution are typical techniques used to hide malicious payloads or backdoors. The use of exec() on dynamically decoded data poses a high security risk, as it can execute any malicious payload embedded within the compressed, encoded data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its obfuscated nature, use of dynamic execution, and combined encoding/compression techniques. It likely contains or executes malicious code, representing a significant security threat.",
