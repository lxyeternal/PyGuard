{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration and executes obfuscated code, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The 'exec' statement executing decoded and decompressed data, which is obfuscated and hidden.",
  "sinks": "The decoded code executed by 'exec', which could perform malicious actions such as data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The setup script is straightforward; the flow of concern is from the obfuscated 'exec' to its execution, potentially leading to malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code using base64 and zlib compression, executed via 'exec', indicating an attempt to hide malicious payload.",
  "analysis": "The script starts with a typical setup configuration for a Python package, which appears benign. However, immediately following, it executes code that has been heavily obfuscated via base64 encoding and zlib compression. This obfuscation is a common tactic to conceal malicious payloads. Without decoding and analyzing the payload, its purpose is suspicious. The payload could be designed to perform unauthorized actions such as data theft, remote access, or system compromise. The use of 'exec' to run decoded binary data is a significant red flag, indicating malicious intent. The rest of the code is standard setup boilerplate, but the obfuscated execution is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated payload executed via 'exec', which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. It is likely designed to hide malicious activities such as data exfiltration or system compromise. The setup configuration appears normal but is overshadowed by the suspicious payload execution.",
