  "conclusion": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated payload executed during package setup, a classic indicator of malicious activity. Given the obfuscation, dynamic execution, and red flags, it is highly likely to be malicious. The package should be considered dangerous, and further analysis of the payload is recommended. The scores should reflect maximum maliciousness and risk."
