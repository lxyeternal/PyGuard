  "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of external code during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious. While the code itself appears benign, this pattern poses a significant security risk, warranting caution and further inspection of 'main.py'. The scores should reflect high concern, with malware and risk scores around 0.75-0.8."
