      "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of external code during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious. While the code itself appears benign, this pattern poses a significant security risk, warranting caution and further inspection of 'main.py'. The scores should reflect high concern, with malware and risk scores around 0.75-0.8."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits privacy-invasive behavior through system info collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains, but lacks active malicious payloads or destructive actions. It should be considered a moderate security risk primarily due to privacy concerns and covert data transmission. The malware score should be low, around 0.2–0.3, reflecting the absence of active malware, while the security risk remains moderate (~0.6). The code is not obfuscated."
