  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, encode MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple external URLs as GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network info, random.randint() generating rd_num, base64 encoding MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending data via GET requests to external URLs.",
  "flows": "System info sources (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) are collected, MAC addresses are base64 encoded, data is appended as URL parameters, then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external URLs (with non-standard domains and subdomains, possibly for exfiltration), encoding MAC addresses before sending, no validation or filtering of URLs, and silent exception handling during HTTP requests.",
  "analysis": "The script collects host-specific data including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. MAC addresses are base64 encoded, possibly to obfuscate raw hardware addresses. It then sends this information to three external URLs via HTTP GET requests with parameters. The URLs are suspicious, possibly malicious, designed for tracking or exfiltration. No data validation or encryption beyond base64 encoding. The exception handling suppresses errors, which may hide failures or malicious activity. The code does not perform any obvious malicious actions like modifying files or executing arbitrary code, but it gathers and transmits system identifiers, which can be used for tracking or profiling. The URLs suggest command and control or data exfiltration points, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects system identifiers and transmits them to external suspicious domains, which indicates potential privacy violation or data exfiltration behavior. While no direct malicious code execution is observed, the intent appears to be to stealthily gather and send system info, possibly for malicious purposes. The presence of suspicious URLs and data collection behavior raises security concerns.",
