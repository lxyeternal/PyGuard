  "conclusion": "The code exhibits privacy-invasive behavior through system info collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains, but lacks active malicious payloads or destructive actions. It should be considered a moderate security risk primarily due to privacy concerns and covert data transmission. The malware score should be low, around 0.2–0.3, reflecting the absence of active malware, while the security risk remains moderate (~0.6). The code is not obfuscated."
