  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses), encodes MAC addresses in base64, and transmits this data via HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function executing system commands (getmac, ifconfig), and the URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls sending HTTP GET requests with system info parameters to external domains.",
  "flows": "System info sources feed into URL parameters, which are then sent via network requests to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious external domains, encoding MAC addresses in base64 (not true obfuscation), silent exception handling hiding errors, no user consent prompts, data transmitted over plain HTTP, no obfuscation or encryption beyond base64.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system identifiers and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data to several suspicious external URLs via HTTP GET requests. No malicious payloads, destructive commands, or code injection are present. The behavior indicates privacy-invasive data exfiltration or fingerprinting. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and exception handling silently ignores errors, which could hide malicious activity or failures. The URLs used are suspicious, suggesting potential tracking or exfiltration. Overall, the code's behavior is privacy-invasive but does not contain active malware or payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits privacy-invasive behavior through system info collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains, but lacks active malicious payloads or destructive actions. It should be considered a moderate security risk primarily due to privacy concerns and covert data transmission. The malware score should be low, around 0.2–0.3, reflecting the absence of active malware, while the security risk remains moderate (~0.6). The code is not obfuscated.",
