  "purpose": "Collect system information (host, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "Platform and getpass modules for hostname and username; os.getcwd() for current directory; get_mac_addresses() function for MAC addresses; random.randint for generating a number; base64 encoding for MAC addresses; URLs with urllib.parse.urlencode for data transmission.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen calls for sending data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) is gathered, encoded, and appended as URL parameters; data flows from sources through encoding, then to the URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits potentially identifiable system info to external servers without user consent, using base64 encoding which is not encryption, potentially hiding the data's nature. The URLs appear suspicious and are unlikely legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to three specified URLs. The data collection includes system-specific identifiers, which could be used for tracking or profiling. The URLs appear malicious or suspicious, as they are unusual and possibly used for command and control or data exfiltration. The code does not include any obfuscation, malicious payload, or backdoor code, but the behavior of exfiltrating system info to unknown endpoints is suspicious. There are no evident attempts to conceal the data or perform harmful actions beyond data transmission. The code's intent appears to be gathering system info potentially for tracking or malicious surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "The code gathers system identifiers and transmits them to external URLs without user knowledge, which is suspicious. While it does not perform destructive actions or malicious payloads directly, its data exfiltration behavior and suspicious URLs suggest potentially malicious intent or at least privacy violation. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to potential privacy violations.",
