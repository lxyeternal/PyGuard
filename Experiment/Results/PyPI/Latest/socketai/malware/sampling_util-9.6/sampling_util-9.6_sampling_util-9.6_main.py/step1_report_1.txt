{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (host, user, current directory, MAC addresses) and send it to external URLs for monitoring or data collection purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading system information via platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which executes system commands to retrieve MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "Sending HTTP GET requests with collected data encoded in URL parameters via urllib.request.urlopen to external domains.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, MAC addresses) are encoded and included as URL parameters in HTTP GET requests sent to third-party domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domain URLs, encoding MAC addresses in base64, and sending data without encryption or user consent. The code collects MAC addresses via system commands which may vary across OS, potentially indicating attempts at fingerprinting or tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are encoded in base64 and sent via GET requests to multiple suspicious domains. The use of external, untrusted URLs and encoding MAC addresses without user knowledge suggests potential privacy invasion or data exfiltration. The code does not include obfuscation or malicious payloads like system damage, remote control, or data theft beyond info gathering. However, the communication to third-party domains for system data collection is suspicious and can be used maliciously. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious system commands are present. The network activity to suspicious domains indicates potential malicious intent or privacy violation.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system info including MAC addresses and transmits it to suspicious domains, indicating potential privacy invasion or data exfiltration. No active malware behavior like damage or remote control is evident, but the data collection and transmission patterns are suspicious.",
