  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send it to multiple external URLs as encoded parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), obtaining MAC addresses via subprocess calls, generating random number, and encoding MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests to external URLs with encoded system data as URL parameters via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered, encoded in base64, assembled into URL parameters, and sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded external URLs with suspicious domain names, encoding MAC addresses and other system info, and sending data without user consent or obvious purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code collects various system identifiers and environment info, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data to external URLs. The domains used are suspicious and appear to be for tracking or exfiltration. There are no apparent obfuscation techniques, and the data transmission is direct and unencrypted (via HTTP). No malicious payloads or destructive actions are present, but the behavior resembles potential fingerprinting or privacy invasion activity. The code’s intent is possibly malicious if used without user consent, as it exfiltrates device-specific info to unknown servers.",
  "conclusion": "The script gathers system information and transmits it to suspicious external domains without user consent, indicating potentially malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. It does not contain direct malware like payloads, but the data exfiltration pattern is suspicious. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to privacy concerns and external communication to untrusted domains.",
