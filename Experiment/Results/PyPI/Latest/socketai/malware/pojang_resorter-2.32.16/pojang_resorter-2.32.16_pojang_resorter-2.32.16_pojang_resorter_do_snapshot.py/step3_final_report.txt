  "purpose": "Capture a screenshot and upload it to a Discord webhook URL.",
  "sources": "ImageGrab.grab() for screenshot; hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending image data to external server.",
  "flows": "Screenshot captured -> saved into memory -> sent via POST request to webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL; no input validation; straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code captures a screenshot using PIL's ImageGrab and uploads it via requests.post() to a fixed Discord webhook URL. It includes proper error handling and logging. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The main concern is the privacy implication of the hardcoded webhook URL, which could be exploited for data exfiltration if misused. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code clarity. The security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, primarily due to the privacy concern related to the exposed webhook URL.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for taking and uploading screenshots. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary risk stems from the hardcoded webhook URL, which could be misused for privacy invasion. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
