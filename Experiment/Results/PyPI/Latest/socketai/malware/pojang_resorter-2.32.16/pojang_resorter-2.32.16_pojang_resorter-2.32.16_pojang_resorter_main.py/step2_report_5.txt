  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a command-line dispatcher that executes other scripts based on user input.\n- It uses a fixed command map, limiting commands to a predefined set.\n- It executes scripts via subprocess.run() without executing arbitrary code.\n- No secrets, obfuscated code, or network activity are present.\n- The primary concern is the external scripts it calls, which could be malicious if compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Benign dispatcher, relies on external scripts, no malware.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 — somewhat cautious, considering external scripts.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; the code itself is not malicious, but the external scripts could be.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes safety and controlled execution.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, given the whitelist approach.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Comments:** The analysis correctly notes the safety of command mapping and subprocess control.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, highlights that execution is limited to whitelisted scripts.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — cautious but justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Also emphasizes that only predefined scripts are run, reducing risk.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Comments:** The report recognizes the controlled nature of script execution.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same overall conclusion, safe command dispatcher.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, given the limited scope.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Comments:** The analysis is accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code within this script.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.3, reflecting the potential risk if external scripts are malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — moderate, mainly due to external script trustworthiness.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, safe command dispatcher, with the main supply chain risk stemming from the external scripts it executes. The scores are appropriate given the information.",
