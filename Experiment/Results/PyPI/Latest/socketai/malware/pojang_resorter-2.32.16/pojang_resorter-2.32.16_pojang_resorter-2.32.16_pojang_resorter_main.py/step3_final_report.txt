  "purpose": "A command-line dispatcher that executes predefined scripts based on user input.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse; determines script names from a command map.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.run() to execute scripts in the same directory based on command input.",
  "flows": "Command input -> command map lookup -> script path -> subprocess.run() to execute script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward command dispatch; no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static command dispatcher that restricts commands to a predefined set, executing corresponding scripts via subprocess. It employs logging and error handling. The main security concern is executing external scripts, which could be malicious if those scripts are compromised. However, the dispatcher itself is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or secrets. The subprocess calls are limited to whitelisted scripts, reducing arbitrary execution risk. The code's clarity and whitelisting approach suggest low inherent risk, with the primary supply chain concern being the integrity of the external scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign command dispatcher with no malicious or obfuscated code. The main risk depends on the trustworthiness of the external scripts it executes. The code itself is safe, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2–0.3) are appropriate. Maintaining these scores is recommended, with attention to external script security.",
