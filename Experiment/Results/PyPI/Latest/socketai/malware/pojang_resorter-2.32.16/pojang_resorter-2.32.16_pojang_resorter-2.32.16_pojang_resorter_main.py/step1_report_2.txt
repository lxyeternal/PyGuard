  "purpose": "A command-line interface tool that executes specific Python scripts based on user commands.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, reading command choices.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution of external scripts, logging errors, printing messages.",
  "flows": "User command input -> command parser -> script name lookup -> subprocess.run() to execute scripts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging and parses command-line arguments for predefined commands. It maps commands to script filenames and executes these scripts via subprocess.run(). The scripts are expected to be in the same directory. Error handling is present, logging failures to execute scripts or missing scripts. No user data is read beyond command arguments. There is no indication of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious activities. All subprocess calls are to other scripts within the same project directory, which appears intended for modular script execution. The code does not perform any insecure operations such as insecure SQL, environment variable leaks, or arbitrary code execution beyond the predefined scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a command dispatcher for executing specific scripts based on user input. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate CLI tool designed to invoke other scripts safely, assuming those scripts themselves are benign.",
