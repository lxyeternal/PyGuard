{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'pojang_resorter' Python package, including dependencies, package info, and entry point.",
  "sources": "Reads package dependencies from 'install_requires' list and package metadata from the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "Installs dependencies, sets up console scripts, and specifies Python version requirements; no direct data leaks or unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Dependencies and metadata are processed during package installation; the entry point executes the main function in 'pojang_resorter.main'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious operations detected. Usage of common packages is typical for GUI automation, HTTP requests, and image processing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. Dependencies include GUI automation, HTTP, image processing, and testing libraries, all of which are legitimate and commonly used. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The structure follows typical Python packaging conventions. No unusual or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manages dependencies and package entry points for a legitimate application.",
