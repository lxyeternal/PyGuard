  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup script, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The confidence is high (1), and the malware score is 0.\n- The security risk is low (0.1), which seems reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n- No issues with the reasoning or scoring here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similarly, it correctly states that the setup script is legitimate, with dependencies and entry points that are typical.\n- The analysis notes that potential malicious behavior could exist in the 'main' module, but since it's not shown, no suspicion is assigned here.\n- The confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- The security risk score (0.2) is acceptable given the context.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- The review confirms the script's legitimacy, with no suspicious elements.\n- The confidence is perfect (1), malware score is 0, security risk is 0.\n- The reasoning is consistent and sound.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- The assessment again finds no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Confidence is 1, malware is 0, security risk is 0.\n- The conclusion is appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- The analysis is consistent with previous reports, confirming the script's benign nature.\n- Confidence is 1, malware score is 0, security risk is 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious behavior:** No. All reports agree the code is a typical setup script.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware:** None detected; all scores are 0.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as expected.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, benign setup configuration for a Python package. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the nature of the code.",
