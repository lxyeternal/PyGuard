{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pojang_resorter', specifying its dependencies, entry points, and Python version requirement.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and dependencies from the 'setup' function parameters, including 'install_requires' and 'entry_points'.",
  "sinks": "Dependencies are installed via 'install_requires', and the entry point runs a main function within the package; no external data sources or sinks are explicitly used in this script.",
  "flows": "The script does not process untrusted data; it only sets up package metadata and dependencies, with no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are detected in the code structure or content. All dependencies are commonly used packages, and the code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package details, dependencies, console scripts, and Python version requirements. No user input, external data reading, or network interactions occur within this script. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. All dependencies are common, and there are no suspicious code flows.",
