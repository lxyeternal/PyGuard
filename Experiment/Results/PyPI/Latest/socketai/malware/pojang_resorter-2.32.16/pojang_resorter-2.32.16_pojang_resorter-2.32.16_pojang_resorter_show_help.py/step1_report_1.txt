{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface (CLI) help display for a tool named 'Pojang Resorter'.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input via command-line arguments using argparse.",
  "sinks": "The code potentially outputs help information through parser.print_help().",
  "flows": "User inputs a command argument which is processed by argparse; the show_help() function then prints help information.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no unusual or suspicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or hidden data flows are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports argparse to parse command-line arguments, defines a function show_help() that creates an ArgumentParser with specific command choices, and then prints help. No untrusted data processing, external network activity, or malicious code is present. The script only displays help info and terminates. No security risks or malware behavior are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI help display script with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies detected. It appears to be a benign utility for user guidance.",
