  "purpose": "Provides a CLI help interface for a tool called 'Pojang Resorter', displaying help information about commands.",
  "sources": "argparse.ArgumentParser initialization and command argument definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute commands with user input.",
  "flows": "User input (command argument) flows into the argument parser, but is only used for displaying help and command choices; no execution based on input occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple command-line interface that offers help information for predefined commands. It creates an ArgumentParser, adds a positional argument with specific choices, and prints help information. There is no code that executes commands, accepts untrusted input for execution, or interacts with external systems. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward CLI help display with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply defines and shows help information for a set of commands.",
