  "flows": "User invokes the script, which runs show_help() to print usage information",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports argparse, defines a function to display help information with specific command choices, and executes this function if run as main. There is no data input, output to external systems, or execution of untrusted code. No malicious behavior or malicious code patterns are present. It appears to be a benign CLI help display implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign CLI help display script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
