{
  "purpose": "Provides a CLI help interface for the 'Pojang Resorter' tool with commands such as 'screenshot', 'botserver', 'do-snapshot', and 'help'.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line input via argparse to determine user commands.",
  "sinks": "The argparse library handles command-line arguments; no direct sink for untrusted data exists in the current code.",
  "flows": "User inputs command-line arguments; argparse processes these inputs to guide program behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely defines a help display function without performing any actions or executing commands. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports argparse for argument parsing. It defines a function to show help information, including the command choices, which are standard CLI commands. The script runs this help function if executed directly. There are no data sinks, no external data fetches, no suspicious behaviors, and no obfuscated or malicious code present. The code appears to be a straightforward CLI help utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely provides usage information for predefined commands without executing any commands or handling sensitive data.",
