  "purpose": "Display help information for a CLI tool with predefined commands.",
  "sources": "argparse.ArgumentParser setup, command argument definition",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external effects",
  "flows": "Input command -> argparse parsing -> help display",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward help display, no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports argparse, defines a function to create an argument parser with specific command choices, and prints help when run. It does not process commands or perform any external actions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help utility with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are accurate and consistent with its behavior.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
