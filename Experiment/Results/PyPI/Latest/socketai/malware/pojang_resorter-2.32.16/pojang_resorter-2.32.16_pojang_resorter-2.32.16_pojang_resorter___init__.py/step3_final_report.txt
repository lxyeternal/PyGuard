{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a minimal package initialization module, providing metadata and importing a main function from a local module for a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .main import main' reads the local module '.main'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports a local module and sets metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package setup with a docstring, a local import, and metadata variables. It does not contain any dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The only potential concern is the imported '.main' module, but without evidence of malicious content, the code appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no malicious or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
