  "sources": "Import statement from .main import main, and package metadata assignments (__version__, __author__).",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or external communication in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since the code only imports a function and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; minimal code with no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a main function from a local module, sets version and author metadata. There is no user input, no external data fetching, and no suspicious or malicious code present. The structure and content are typical for a package's __init__.py or module metadata setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward package initialization script with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It does not contain obfuscation or malware indicators.",
