  "purpose": "Defines package metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only module metadata and import statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code only sets metadata and imports a function.",
  "anomalies": "Lacks suspicious or unusual code; minimal structure, straightforward metadata and import.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal package initialization file, setting version and author metadata and importing a main function from a relative module. No input handling, no execution of untrusted data, and no malicious patterns detected. The import could potentially bring in malicious code if the imported module is compromised, but there is no evidence of that here. Overall, the code is benign and appears to be standard package boilerplate.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initialization file with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It simply sets metadata and imports a main function, with no evidence of sabotage or malicious code.",
