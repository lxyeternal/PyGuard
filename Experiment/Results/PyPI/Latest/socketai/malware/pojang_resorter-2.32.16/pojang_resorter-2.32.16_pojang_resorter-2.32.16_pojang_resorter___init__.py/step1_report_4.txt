  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool by importing main functionality and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No potential data leaks or untrusted data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets metadata and imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated content.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a package docstring, an import statement, and metadata variables (__version__, __author__). There are no data inputs, outputs, or code execution flows that could lead to security issues. The import statement references a local module (.main), which appears standard for package organization. No signs of malicious behavior or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and standard for a Python package module. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks based on its content.",
