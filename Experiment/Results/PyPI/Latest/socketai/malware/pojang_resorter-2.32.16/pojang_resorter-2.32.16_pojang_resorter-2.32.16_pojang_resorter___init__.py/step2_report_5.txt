  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code snippet is minimal, consisting solely of:\n  - A package docstring.\n  - An import statement: `from .main import main`.\n  - Metadata variables: `__version__` and `__author__`.\n- No input/output, network activity, environment variable handling, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or embedded malicious code.\n- The import is from a local module (`.main`), which is typical for package setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of code**: The code is straightforward and does not contain any malicious or suspicious constructs.\n- **Malware**: All reports assign malware score 0, which aligns with the code content.\n- **Obfuscation**: All reports assign obfuscated score 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk**: All reports assign security risk 0, consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5**:  \n- **Purpose**: They all describe the code as a minimal package setup, importing a main function and defining metadata.  \n- **Analysis**: Correctly states that there are no data flows, no suspicious code, and no malicious intent.  \n- **Conclusion**: All conclude the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Scores**:  \n- **Malware**: 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (correct)  \n- **SecurityRisk**: 0 (correct)  \n- **Confidence**: 1 (appropriate given the simplicity and clarity)  \n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- The reports do not assume malicious intent beyond the code snippet; they are consistent.\n- The only potential concern is the import from `.main`. If the `.main` module is malicious, that could be problematic, but the report rightly notes that there's no evidence here.  \n- The code's minimal nature and lack of suspicious features support a benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score**: 0 — No signs of malicious code or behavior.  \n**Obfuscated score**: 0 — Clear, straightforward code.  \n**Risk score**: 0 — No security risks detected.\n\n**Additional considerations**:\n- The import of `.main` could be a vector if the module is compromised, but since this is just a code snippet, there's no evidence of that.\n- No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no network calls.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nBased on the provided code and reports, **the scores assigned are appropriate and consistent**. The code is benign, standard package boilerplate, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways consider the contents of the imported module (`.main`) when assessing the overall security posture, but based solely on this snippet, the package appears safe.",
