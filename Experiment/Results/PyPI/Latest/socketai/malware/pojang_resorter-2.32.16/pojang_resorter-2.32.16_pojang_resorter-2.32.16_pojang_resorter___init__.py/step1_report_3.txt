  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool by importing main functions and setting metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main import main, and metadata variables (__version__, __author__).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data handling, no network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only imports and defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports a main function from a relative module and defines version and author metadata. It does not perform any input/output, network activity, or data processing. There are no indications of malicious intent or unusual behavior. The code is minimal and typical of Python package __init__.py files.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply sets up module metadata and imports a main function, consistent with standard package initialization. No security concerns identified.",
