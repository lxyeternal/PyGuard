  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `main` from `.cli` and `__version__` from `.version`.\n- Sets `__all__` for exports.\n- Attempts to import `run_pre_install` from `.installer` and execute it during import, suppressing `ImportError`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code executes `run_pre_install()` during import if the module is available.\n- This pattern is somewhat unusual because side-effect functions are typically run during setup or installation scripts, not during module import.\n- However, there is no evidence of malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or external communication.\n- The `try-except` pattern is standard for optional dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, benign setup routine.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. The code is standard, and no issues are identified.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the optional pre-install check, no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The execution during import is atypical but not malicious.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Recognizes the pattern of executing `run_pre_install()` during import but considers it not inherently malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (slightly higher due to potential risk)\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. The concern about executing code during import is valid but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Highlights the unusual pattern of executing `run_pre_install()` during import, noting the potential risk.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7 (lower, perhaps due to less certainty)\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.3\n- **Verdict:** Slightly conservative but justified. The pattern is potentially risky if `run_pre_install()` is malicious, but there's no evidence here.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, considers the pattern standard but noteworthy.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`, which aligns with the evidence—no malicious code or behavior is observed.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign `0`, consistent with the clear code.\n- **Risk scores:** They vary from 0.1 to 0.3, reflecting the concern about executing code during import.\n\n**Given the code:**\n- The execution of `run_pre_install()` during import is somewhat unconventional but not inherently malicious.\n- Without inspecting the actual implementation of `run_pre_install()`, we cannot definitively say it is safe, but the pattern alone is not malicious.\n- The risk score should be moderate, perhaps around 0.2, reflecting the potential concern but not a high threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated:** Keep at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Should be **around 0.2**, acknowledging the unconventional pattern but no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                                                                   |\n|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                   | No malicious activity detected.                                                                |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                   | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation observed.                                               |\n| Risk             | 0.2                 | Execution of setup code during import is unusual but not malicious; moderate concern.          |\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign but with a pattern that warrants caution.**",
