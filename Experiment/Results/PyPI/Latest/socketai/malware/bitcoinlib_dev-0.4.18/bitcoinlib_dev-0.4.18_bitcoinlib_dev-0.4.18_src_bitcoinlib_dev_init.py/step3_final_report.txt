  "purpose": "Initialize package modules and optionally run pre-install checks during import.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'cli', 'version', and optionally 'installer'; execution of 'run_pre_install()' if available.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'run_pre_install()' during import, which could run arbitrary code if compromised.",
  "flows": "Import of modules -> execution of 'run_pre_install()' if present.",
  "anomalies": "Running 'run_pre_install()' during import is unconventional; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package initialization with a conditional pre-install hook. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The invocation of 'run_pre_install()' during import could pose a security risk if the function is malicious or has side effects, but there is no evidence of this. The pattern is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk between 0.1 and 0.3) are consistent with the analysis, considering the moderate concern about executing code during import. Overall, the code appears benign, with a potential but unconfirmed risk associated with the execution of setup routines during import.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup module with a conditional pre-install step. No malicious or obfuscated activity is detected. The main concern is executing code during import, which warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
