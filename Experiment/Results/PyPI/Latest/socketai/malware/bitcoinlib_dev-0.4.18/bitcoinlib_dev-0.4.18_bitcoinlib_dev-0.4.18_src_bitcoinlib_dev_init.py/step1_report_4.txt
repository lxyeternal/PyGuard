  "flows": "Import of run_pre_install() -> execution during import if module exists",
  "anomalies": "Execution of run_pre_install() during module import is unusual, as it runs code at import time which could be exploited if run_pre_install() contains malicious code or unintended side-effects",
  "analysis": "The code imports main components and version info, then attempts to run run_pre_install() from installer module if available. This pattern can be used to perform checks or setup actions. The call to run_pre_install() during import is not inherently malicious but is unconventional and could be risky if the function contains malicious code or side effects. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior directly visible. The try-except block prevents import errors from breaking execution but does not mitigate the potential risk of executing code during import.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard module setup with an optional pre-install check. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the execution of run_pre_install() during import is a potential risk point. Without inspecting run_pre_install(), the risk level cannot be fully determined, but based on this snippet alone, it appears to be a standard pattern with moderate concern.",
