{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package by importing modules and executing a pre-install check if available.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'cli', 'version', and 'installer'; execution of 'run_pre_install' during import.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'run_pre_install' if present; no other untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Importing modules, then conditionally executing 'run_pre_install' which may perform checks or setup actions.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import and execution of 'run_pre_install' is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up the package exports, then attempts to run a pre-install hook if available, suppressing errors if not. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The only dynamic behavior is the optional invocation of 'run_pre_install', which appears to be a normal setup routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package initialization script with a benign optional pre-install check. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is identified.",
