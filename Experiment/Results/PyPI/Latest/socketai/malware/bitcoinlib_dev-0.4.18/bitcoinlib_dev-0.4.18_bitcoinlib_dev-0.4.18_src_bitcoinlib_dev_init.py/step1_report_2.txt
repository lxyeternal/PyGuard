{
  "purpose": "This module appears to set up exports for CLI main function and version info, and conditionally runs pre-install checks.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .cli, .version, and optionally .installer",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external effects observed",
  "flows": "Import statements lead to module loading; run_pre_install() may execute code during import",
  "anomalies": "Conditional execution of run_pre_install() during import is unusual; potential side effect at import time, but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports core components and exports them via __all__. It attempts to run run_pre_install() if available, which suggests some setup or checks occur during import. The try-except block suppresses ImportError, avoiding crashes if installer module is missing. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The run_pre_install() function’s behavior cannot be assessed here, but its invocation during import is somewhat atypical but not necessarily malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup module with a conditional pre-install hook. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected in this fragment.",
