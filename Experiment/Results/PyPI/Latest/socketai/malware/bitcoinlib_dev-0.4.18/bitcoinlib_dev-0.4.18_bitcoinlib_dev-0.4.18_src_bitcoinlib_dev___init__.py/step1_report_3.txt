{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a basic utility or module functionality, but without specific context, its overall purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from environment variables and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via print statements, and potentially writes or executes code via eval or exec, if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or parameters to print statements or dynamic execution points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are visible. However, potential use of eval/exec (if present) could be a concern if untrusted data is processed.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with imports and environment variable access, possibly to configure behavior. The main functions are straightforward, handling data processing and output. No suspicious network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are evident. If eval or exec are used on untrusted input, that could be risky, but in their absence, the code is benign. The structure and formatting appear normal, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The overall behavior suggests a standard utility with no malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no clear signs of malware or malicious intent. It appears to be a benign utility module, assuming no hidden eval/exec or malicious payloads not visible in the provided snippet.",
