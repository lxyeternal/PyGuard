{
  "purpose": "The code collects system info, IP geolocation, environment variables, and files, then transmits this data via multiple external channels (Telegram, Discord, custom API).",
  "sources": "Environment variables, platform system info, file system reads, network requests to external services.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external APIs (Telegram, Discord, custom API), file reads for attachments, environment variables for credentials.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (credentials, system info, files) are gathered and then sent via network requests to external endpoints without validation or user consent.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded sensitive credentials (tokens, webhooks, API endpoints), excessive blank lines, no input validation, no error handling for network requests.",
  "analysis": "The code uses hardcoded secrets for messaging and API endpoints, collects system and IP info, and transmits data covertly. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The functions operate silently, exfiltrating data without user awareness. The high potential for data theft and privacy invasion, combined with embedded secrets, indicates malicious intent or high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a covert data exfiltration tool with hardcoded credentials and extensive external communication, representing a high security threat. It lacks obfuscation but is designed for stealthy information gathering and transmission, justifying high malware and risk scores.",
