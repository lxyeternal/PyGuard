  "purpose": "CLI tool for managing BitcoinLib wallets and database updates, forwarding command-line arguments and file contents to a database interface.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, especially file paths and sensitive data like passwords and private keys.",
  "sinks": "The method self.db.send_to_all, which transmits data, potentially over the network or to logs.",
  "flows": "Arguments and file contents are validated and then sent via send_to_all; sensitive data is masked in logs but forwarded in raw form.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling suppresses errors; printing sys.argv may leak invocation details; no encryption of sensitive data before transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code processes CLI arguments, identifies file paths, and forwards both file contents and argument descriptions to send_to_all. Sensitive data such as passwords and private keys are masked in logs but sent unencrypted. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The main concern is potential data leakage if send_to_all transmits data insecurely. No signs of malware or backdoors are detected. The code's behavior aligns with legitimate CLI handling, but privacy practices are weak.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate CLI handler with potential privacy risks due to unencrypted forwarding of sensitive data. No malware or obfuscation is evident. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily from data handling practices, not malicious intent.",
