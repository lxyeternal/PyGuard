  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, standard use of bitcoinlib, no suspicious network activity, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears legitimate. The security risk is low, primarily due to the potential privacy concern of printing sensitive info.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious code, standard operations, but notes that printing passphrases can be a privacy concern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is standard and not malicious. The privacy concern is noted but does not elevate the security risk score.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no malicious behavior, standard use, sensitive data printed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments; no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar, with emphasis on sensitive data exposure via print statements. No malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the main concern is data leakage, not malicious intent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard wallet functions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious code, no backdoors, no suspicious network activity. The scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports show no obfuscation, which aligns with the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** The main concern across reports is the exposure of sensitive data (passphrases, private keys) via print statements. While this is a security concern, it is not malicious or indicative of an attack. The risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate, reflecting a low but noteworthy concern about data leakage.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at **0**. No evidence suggests malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Remain at **0.2**, considering the privacy implications but no active malicious threat.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code's core functions are standard for wallet management.\n- The potential for data leakage via logs or console output should be addressed in production but does not indicate malicious intent.\n- No signs of supply chain compromise or malicious payloads are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The overall assessment aligns with the reports: the code is legitimate, with minimal security concerns related to data exposure, but no malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or specific recommendations for mitigating the privacy concerns.",
