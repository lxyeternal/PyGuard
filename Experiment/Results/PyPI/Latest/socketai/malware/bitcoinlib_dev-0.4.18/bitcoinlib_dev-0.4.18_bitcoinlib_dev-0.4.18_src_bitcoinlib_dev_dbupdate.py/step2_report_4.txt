  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script manages database versioning, backups, and data migration with standard practices. No suspicious behavior or malicious code detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the assessment.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, considering the script's functions.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies the script's purpose, flow, and lack of malicious activity. The only minor concern could be the use of `input()` for confirmation, but it's standard and not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard database operations, user confirmation, and data migration.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — low.\n- **Comments:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, straightforward data handling.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also aligns with previous assessments. Highlights standard data migration, version checking, and safe file operations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — still very low.\n- **Comments:** No malicious patterns or suspicious activities detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with emphasis on data handling, backups, and version management.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Comments:** No malicious activity or obfuscation observed.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also consistent, noting standard database and file operations, user prompts, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Comments:** No suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Code Analysis:** The code is a typical database migration utility for a cryptocurrency library. It performs version checks, backups, data migration, and version updates. All operations are standard, with no network activity, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious routines.\n\n- **Malware Score:** Given the absence of any malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior, the malware score should remain at **0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Risk Score:** While the script involves file operations and user prompts, these are standard for such utilities. The risk score should be **very low**, perhaps around **0.1 to 0.2**, consistent with the reports.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — low, considering the context.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate.\n- The code is safe, standard, and performs expected functions without malicious intent.\n- No adjustments to the scores are necessary based on the provided analysis.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThese reflect a low-security risk, consistent with the detailed review.",
