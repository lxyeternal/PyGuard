{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script configures a Python package named 'pojang_resorter' with specified dependencies and entry points. It serves to facilitate package installation and execution, with no runtime code or malicious behavior embedded.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependencies, and entry point definitions from static declarations within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data handling within this script; it solely defines package configuration.",
  "flows": "The script flows from static declarations to package installation procedures; no data flows or external data processing occur within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration using setuptools, specifying package info, dependencies, and entry points. It does not include runtime logic, network activity, or data handling. Dependencies are common libraries that could be used at runtime but do not indicate malicious intent in this static context. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The dependency list and static configuration do not pose security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
