  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pojang_resorter' Python package, defining dependencies, entry points, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools; package configuration data within setup() including package requirements, entry points, and Python version constraints.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no code execution or data handling beyond package configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this is a static setup configuration without data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or unusual code patterns detected. Usage of standard setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and console script entry points. All dependencies are common libraries used for GUI, HTTP requests, version control, image processing, and Windows automation. No obfuscated code, hidden functions, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not include runtime code execution or network communication within this script. It appears to be a typical setup configuration for a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal setup configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only manages package installation parameters and entry points. No malware or security concerns identified.",
