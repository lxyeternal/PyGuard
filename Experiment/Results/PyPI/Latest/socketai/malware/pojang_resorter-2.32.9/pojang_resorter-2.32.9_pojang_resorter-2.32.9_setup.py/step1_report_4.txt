{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the installation of the 'pojang_resorter' Python package, specifying dependencies and entry points for command-line execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads package requirements from the 'install_requires' list and the entry point 'pojang-resorter' from 'pojang_resorter.main:main'.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks for untrusted data, system modification, or data exfiltration. No functions indicate data leakage or system manipulation.",
  "flows": "Dependencies are installed from package specifications; the entry point executes a function from the package. No external data flows are explicitly indicated.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments are present. The code appears to be standard setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' modules for package setup. It specifies package name, version, dependencies, and entry points. Dependencies include common libraries, some that interface with system or network functions, but their usage is not shown here. The script's structure and content are typical for a Python package setup. No signs of malicious intent such as backdoors, data theft, or suspicious network behavior are present. The dependencies themselves do not imply malicious activity, as they are standard libraries used in many legitimate projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. It simply defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
