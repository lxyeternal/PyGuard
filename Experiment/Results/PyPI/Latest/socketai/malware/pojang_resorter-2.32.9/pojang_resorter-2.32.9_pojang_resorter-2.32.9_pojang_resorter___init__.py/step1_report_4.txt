{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, acting as an entry point and version/author metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports 'main' from a local module '.main'. No other data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code primarily imports and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials (beyond version and author info), or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a main function from a local module and setting metadata variables. No data processing, user input handling, or external communication present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The structure appears typical for a Python package's __init__.py or main module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security concerns. It functions as a simple package initialization with metadata.",
