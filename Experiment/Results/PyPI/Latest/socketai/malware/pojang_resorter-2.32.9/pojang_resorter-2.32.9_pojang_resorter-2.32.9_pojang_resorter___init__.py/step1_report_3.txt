{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, mainly importing the main function and defining version and author metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.main' to access the main function, and module-level metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no network, file, or environment interactions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily imports and metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a main function from a local module and setting version and author metadata. No external inputs, data processing, or network activity present. The structure is straightforward and does not show signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module setup with metadata. No malicious behavior, security threats, or anomalies detected based on this fragment.",
