{
  "purpose": "Defines metadata for the Pojang Resorter CLI package, including version, author, and main module import.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module '.main'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data processing or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only imports a module and sets metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of code execution, no dynamic code, no hidden or suspicious constructs; the code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports the main function from a local module. There are no input sources, data processing, or network communications. The import is from a relative module, which is standard for package structure. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple metadata and import declaration for a Python package, with no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks identified.",
