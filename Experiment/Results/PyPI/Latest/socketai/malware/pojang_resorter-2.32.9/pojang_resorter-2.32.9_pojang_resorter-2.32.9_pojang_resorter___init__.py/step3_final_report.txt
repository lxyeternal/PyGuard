  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal package module, setting metadata and importing the main function for a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a local module '.main'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports a module and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that defines version and author metadata, then imports a local 'main' function. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package entry point with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified.",
