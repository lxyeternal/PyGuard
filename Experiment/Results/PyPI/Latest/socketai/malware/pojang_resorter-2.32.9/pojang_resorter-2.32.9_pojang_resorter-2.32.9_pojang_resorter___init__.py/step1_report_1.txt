  "anomalies": "Lack of any suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual patterns. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports a main function from a local module. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no network activity. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious instructions are present. The import from a local module is standard practice for CLI tools, not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a package entry point and metadata definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
