  "sources": "Code snippets, dynamic eval/exec usage, obfuscation patterns, data input points.",
  "sinks": "Network functions, file operations, system calls, data transmission points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec or input data passing into network or system functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic execution, obfuscation, complex or suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits suspicion primarily due to dynamic eval/exec usage and obfuscation patterns, which could be exploited for malicious purposes. The absence of explicit malicious payloads keeps the malware likelihood moderate. The scores across reports are generally consistent with their descriptions: reports with code snippets showing obfuscation or dynamic execution have moderate malware scores (~0.3), while those without code or with benign code have scores near zero. The confidence levels reflect the certainty based on available information. No evidence suggests active malicious behavior, but the potential for misuse exists in suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates low to moderate risk, with the primary concern centered on Report 1's suspicion of dynamic eval/exec and obfuscation. The scores are justified and consistent with the evidence. No significant adjustments are necessary; the current scoring accurately reflects the analyzed data.",
