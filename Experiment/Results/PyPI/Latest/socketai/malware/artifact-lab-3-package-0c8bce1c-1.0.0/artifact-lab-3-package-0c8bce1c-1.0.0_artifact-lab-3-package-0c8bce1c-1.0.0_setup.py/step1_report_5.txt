{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that leaks environment variables to an external server during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request sent to an external URL with encoded environment variables",
  "flows": "os.environ data -> urllib.parse.urlencode -> urllib.request.Request -> urllib.request.urlopen",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional leak of environment variables during install and develop commands; external URL is hardcoded and suspicious; no validation or user consent",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and overrides the 'install' and 'develop' commands to execute 'notmalfunc()' after standard operations. The 'notmalfunc()' function retrieves all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded ngrok URL. This behavior leaks potentially sensitive information without user knowledge. The setup configuration specifies package details and links the custom commands. The code's purpose appears to be to exfiltrate environment variables during package installation or development setup, which is suspicious and indicates malicious intent or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code intentionally leaks environment variables to an external server during installation or development setup, constituting malicious behavior with potential privacy and security implications.",
