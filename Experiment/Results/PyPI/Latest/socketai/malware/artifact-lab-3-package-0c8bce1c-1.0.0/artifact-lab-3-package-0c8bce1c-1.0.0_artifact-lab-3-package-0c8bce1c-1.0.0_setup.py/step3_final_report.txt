{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates environment variables during package installation or development setup by sending them to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.environ during the notmalfunc() function execution.",
  "sinks": "Sending encoded environment data via HTTP POST request to 'https://29c2aa2421c8.ngrok.app'.",
  "flows": "The environment variables are collected in notmalfunc(), URL-encoded, and transmitted over the network during the run() methods of custom install/develop commands.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional exfiltration of all environment variables during setup, use of a transient ngrok URL, no user notification or consent, and straightforward malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly collects all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them to an external server during package install and development setup, which is abnormal and malicious behavior. The URL used is suspicious, and the activity constitutes data leakage. The code is clear, not obfuscated, and the behavior is consistent with malicious exfiltration. The high malware score (1) and security risk score (1) are justified given the data leakage of potentially sensitive information. The logic is sound, with no false assumptions or errors. The activity poses a severe privacy and security threat, aligning with supply chain attack characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, exfiltrating environment variables during package setup, representing a severe security and privacy breach. The high malware and risk scores are justified and consistent with the behavior.",
