{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup process that leaks environment variables by sending them to an external URL during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The function `notmalfunc()` reads environment variables from `os.environ`.",
  "sinks": "The environment variables are URL-encoded and sent via HTTP POST request to 'https://29c2aa2421c8.ngrok.app'.",
  "flows": "Input source: `os.environ` -> encoding with `urllib.parse.urlencode` -> HTTP request to remote server via `urllib.request.urlopen()`.",
  "anomalies": "The code intentionally exfiltrates environment variables during install/develop commands; usage of a seemingly malicious URL (`ngrok.app`) for data exfiltration; no validation or restrictions are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and overrides the `develop` and `install` commands to include a function `notmalfunc()` that captures and sends all environment variables to an external URL. This behavior is not standard for package setup scripts and indicates malicious intent related to data leakage. No other suspicious or malicious code is present beyond this environment variable exfiltration. The URL used is an ngrok endpoint, which is often used for transient or malicious data transfer. The code runs during package installation and development setup, making it capable of capturing environment variables on every installation or setup, posing a significant privacy and security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables during installation or development setup, indicating a high security risk. The code is not obfuscated but intentionally designed to leak data to an external server, which is malicious activity.",
