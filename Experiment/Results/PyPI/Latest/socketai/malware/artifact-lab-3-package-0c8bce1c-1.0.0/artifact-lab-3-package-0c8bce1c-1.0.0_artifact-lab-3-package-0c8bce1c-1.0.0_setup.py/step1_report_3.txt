{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to package a Python project and includes custom installation and development commands that leak environment variables to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Environment variables are read via os.environ within the notmalfunc() function.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via urllib.request.urlopen to an external URL ('https://29c2aa2421c8.ngrok.app') in the notmalfunc() function, which acts as a network sink.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (source) are encoded and sent through an HTTP request (sink) during the run of the custom install and develop commands.",
  "anomalies": "The function notmalfunc() is invoked during both installation and development setup, which is unusual and suspicious. The URL used ('ngrok.app') indicates a potentially insecure or malicious external endpoint. The code leaks all environment variables, which can include sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and defines custom commands that extend the default install and develop classes. The function notmalfunc() collects environment variables, encodes them, and sends them over HTTP to a remote server. This behavior occurs during both installation and development, which is atypical and indicates an intentional data exfiltration. The URL is suspicious, potentially malicious. The code does not perform any other functions or validations, focusing solely on leaking environment data. No other malicious behavior, such as backdoors or file manipulations, is present. The overall intent appears to be to exfiltrate environment data during package setup, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables to a remote server during package installation and development. It appears intentionally designed for data leakage, likely malicious. The use of an ngrok URL suggests a malicious actor controlling the endpoint. Overall, this package poses a security risk and should not be used.",
