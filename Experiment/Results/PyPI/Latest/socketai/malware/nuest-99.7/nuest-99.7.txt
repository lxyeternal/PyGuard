      "conclusion": "The pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially if 'main.py' is untrusted. While no malicious code is confirmed, this practice poses a high security risk. The scores should reflect this concern, with a malware score around 0.7 and a security risk score around 0.8, indicating high potential for malicious activity and security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert collection and transmission of system information to external, suspicious domains, indicating malicious or highly suspicious behavior. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75-0.8, security risk ~0.8-0.9) are justified. Minor score adjustments, such as increasing malware score in report 4 from 0.3 to around 0.7, would better reflect the behavior. Overall, the code should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious due to its privacy-invasive exfiltration activities."
