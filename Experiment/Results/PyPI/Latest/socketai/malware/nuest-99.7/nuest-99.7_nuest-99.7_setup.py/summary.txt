  "conclusion": "The pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially if 'main.py' is untrusted. While no malicious code is confirmed, this practice poses a high security risk. The scores should reflect this concern, with a malware score around 0.7 and a security risk score around 0.8, indicating high potential for malicious activity and security threat."
