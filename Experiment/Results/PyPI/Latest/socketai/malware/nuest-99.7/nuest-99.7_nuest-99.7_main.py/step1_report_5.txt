  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() which transmits data to remote URLs",
  "flows": "system info (hostname, user, current path) and a random number are encoded and sent via HTTP GET requests to external servers",
  "anomalies": "The code sends system information to suspicious external domains without any user consent or clear purpose; the URLs appear obfuscated or malicious. The use of random numbers in URL paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or track requests.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, current directory, and generates a random number. It constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends system details via GET requests. The URLs are associated with known suspicious or malicious domains, indicating potential data exfiltration. There is no user interaction, no validation, and no clear benign purpose. The code could be used to track or identify systems secretly. No malicious code injection, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present, but the behavior of exfiltration to suspicious domains is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be collecting and exfiltrating system information to external servers with suspicious domains, which indicates malicious intent or at least malicious behavior. The code does not perform any harmful actions directly but facilitates data leakage. It is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
