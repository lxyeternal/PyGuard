  "purpose": "The code collects system information such as hostname, username, and current directory, then sends this data to multiple remote URLs with a random identifier as a parameter.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP requests to external URLs with embedded system info and a random number via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, username, current path, random number) is encoded as URL parameters and sent via HTTP GET requests to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "The code silently reports failure to reach URLs and repeatedly contacts external servers with system info; use of multiple suspicious domains (oast-cn, oast.fun). No user input is involved, but data exfiltration is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code collects basic system information and constructs URLs with this data, then attempts to send HTTP GET requests to three external domains. The use of oast domains suggests possible testing or malicious exfiltration. No malicious payload or backdoor code is present, but the consistent data sending to untrusted domains indicates potential privacy violations or tracking behavior. No code obfuscation or malicious backdoor mechanisms are visible; the code appears straightforward but suspicious due to its external data transmission pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code gathers system info and sends it to external URLs without user consent, indicative of data exfiltration or tracking. While no explicit malware actions are detected, its behavior is suspicious and could be used maliciously for privacy invasion or system reconnaissance.",
