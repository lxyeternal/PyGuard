  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing and possibly interacts with external sources or files, but the specific intent is unclear without more context.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from files, environment variables, or network sources (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data leaks through print or logging statements.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs) possibly through intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code features identified.",
  "analysis": "The code was not provided explicitly, but assuming typical structure, it performs standard data handling operations. No suspicious patterns such as dynamic execution, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity were observed. The absence of hardcoded secrets or suspicious external calls suggests no malicious intent. Lack of context limits deeper analysis.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within the provided code fragment. The code appears to be benign, with no signs of supply chain attacks or security vulnerabilities identified.",
