  "conclusion": "The majority of the code appears benign with low security risks, except for report 2, which indicates suspicious activity justifying higher threat scores. The scoring aligns well with the descriptions; minor adjustments could be made if actual code evidence contradicts suspicion. Overall, the reports are appropriately rated, with no significant revisions necessary."
