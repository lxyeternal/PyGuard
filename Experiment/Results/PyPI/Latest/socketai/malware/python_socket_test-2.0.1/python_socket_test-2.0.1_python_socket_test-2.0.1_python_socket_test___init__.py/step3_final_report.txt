  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, network/file operations, dynamic code execution points, package metadata, hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, subprocess calls, environment variable access, file modifications, eval()/exec() execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user/env) -> processing functions -> sinks (network, subprocess, eval/exec).",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), obfuscated strings, dynamic code execution, suspicious network/subprocess activity, hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical patterns of benign data processing in reports 1, 3, 4, 5, with no suspicious indicators. Report 2 describes dynamic execution, obfuscation, and network activity, suggesting potential malicious intent. Scores are aligned with the suspicion levels: benign reports have malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0 or low; report 2's higher scores (malware 0.6, obfuscated 0.7, risk 0.75) are justified if such patterns are confirmed. Confidence levels reflect the certainty based on available descriptions. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the provided summaries and reasoning.",
  "conclusion": "The majority of the code appears benign with low security risks, except for report 2, which indicates suspicious activity justifying higher threat scores. The scoring aligns well with the descriptions; minor adjustments could be made if actual code evidence contradicts suspicion. Overall, the reports are appropriately rated, with no significant revisions necessary.",
