{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the Python package 'python_socket_test', including package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "The package reads the README.md file for long description; find_packages() dynamically retrieves package modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious behavior; setup configuration is standard.",
  "flows": "The code reads 'README.md' during setup, which is a static file, and dynamically determines packages via find_packages(). No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs. The setup script is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script utilizes setuptools for package setup, reading a markdown file for description and defining entry points for console scripts. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The use of find_packages() is typical for dynamic package discovery. No obfuscation, hidden code, or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious code or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
