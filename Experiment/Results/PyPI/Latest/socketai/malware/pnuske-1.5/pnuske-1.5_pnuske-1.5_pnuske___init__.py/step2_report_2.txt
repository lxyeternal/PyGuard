  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the code in the snippet:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement: `from .main import run`. There are no other code constructs, data flows, or execution logic present.\n\n2. **Malicious activity or obfuscation:**  \n   - All reports agree that the code is minimal and straightforward.  \n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.  \n   - The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, environment variable manipulations, or dynamic code execution.\n\n3. **Errors or flaws in the reports:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate given the snippet.  \n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate for such a minimal snippet.  \n   - Report 5 has a slightly lower confidence (0.7), which is reasonable considering the minimal context.\n\n4. **Scores and their justification:**  \n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.  \n   - Security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate given the lack of evidence for vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential for higher risk scores:**  \n   - Since the code is only an import statement, raising the risk score would be unjustified unless additional context indicates malicious use (e.g., if the imported module is known to be malicious, but that is outside the scope of this snippet).  \n   - The reports do not assume malicious intent beyond the minimal code, which is correct.\n\n6. **Overall assessment:**  \n   - The code is benign and typical in modular Python projects.  \n   - The reports are accurate and do not overstate any risk or malicious activity.\n\n**My own estimates for the scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, just a benign import statement, but as a best practice, any import could be slightly risky if the imported module is compromised, but that is outside this snippet's scope)\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary. The code snippet is benign, with no malware or obfuscation, and poses minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a simple, standard import statement.  \n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.  \n- Scores are justified and consistent across reports.  \n- I recommend maintaining the current scores with a very low risk score of around 0.1 for completeness.",
