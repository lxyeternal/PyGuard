{
  "purpose": "The code imports a 'run' function from a local module named 'main', likely to execute main functionality of a package or script.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .main import run' is a source where code references another module within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks in this snippet, as no data is processed or output is generated.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing 'run' from '.main'; no further data flow or execution occurs in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident. It appears as a standard import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement referencing a local module. It does not perform any actions, process data, or execute code beyond importing. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The snippet is too small to determine any malicious intent or security issues, but based on its simplicity, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a basic import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a larger script that uses the imported 'run' function. No malware indicators or anomalies are detected.",
