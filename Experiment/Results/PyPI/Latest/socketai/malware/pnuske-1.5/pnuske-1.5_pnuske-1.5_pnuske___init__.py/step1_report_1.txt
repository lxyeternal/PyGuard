  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from a local module named 'main' to execute some functionality defined there.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package/module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in this snippet; potential sinks depend on what 'run' does when called elsewhere.",
  "flows": "N/A (no function call or data flow present in this snippet)",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious constructs visible.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports a function named 'run' from a local module 'main'. There are no data inputs, environment variable usage, or code execution beyond the import statement. Without additional context or function calls, no malicious activity can be inferred. The snippet alone is too minimal to determine any malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger program, and on its own, it does not pose security concerns.",
