  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from the local 'main' module, likely to execute or expose functionality defined elsewhere.",

  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow present within this single line.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; minimal code provided.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a function from a local module named 'main'. There are no indications of input reading, data processing, or output. Without additional context or code, there is no evident malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risk. The minimal structure suggests this is a simple import statement typical in modular Python code.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this single import statement, there is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The code appears standard and benign.",
