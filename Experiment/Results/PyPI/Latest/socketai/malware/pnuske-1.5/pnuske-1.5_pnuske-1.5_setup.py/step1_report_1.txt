  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and installing the 'pnuske' Python package.",
  "sources": "N/A (standard setup parameters, no input reading).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data sinks or external data handling).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flows or source-to-sink paths).",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward use of setuptools for packaging; no suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' to define package metadata and entry points, specifically setting up a console script 'pnuske' that invokes 'pnuske:run'. All elements are standard for Python packaging; there are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors such as network activity or data leakage. The use of 'find_packages()' dynamically detects packages in the directory, which is common. No external data inputs, environment variables, or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a typical package configuration for a Python project with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
