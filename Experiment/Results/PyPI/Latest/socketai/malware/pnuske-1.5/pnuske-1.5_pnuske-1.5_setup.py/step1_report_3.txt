  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package named 'pnuske' for distribution, including entry point for command-line execution.",
  "sources": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, and reads package configuration data such as name, version, packages, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external resource usage that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from package metadata to installation setup parameters, with no dynamic or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and typical of Python package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and install configuration, including an entry point for a CLI command 'pnuske'. There are no signs of code injection, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior. The code does not read external input, handle untrusted data, or include any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a standard package configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
