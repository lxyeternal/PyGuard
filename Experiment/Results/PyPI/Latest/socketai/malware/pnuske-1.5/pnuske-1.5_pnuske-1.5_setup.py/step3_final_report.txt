  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and CLI entry point for 'pnuske'.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including 'name', 'version', 'packages', and 'entry_points'.",
  "sinks": "The 'pnuske:run' function call invoked when the CLI command is executed.",
  "flows": "Execution flow from package installation to invoking 'pnuske:run' via CLI.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools. It specifies package name, version, packages, and a console script entry point. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external data handling are present. The entry point references 'pnuske:run', which is standard for CLI tools, but its implementation is outside this scope. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no malicious intent or security issues. All reports agree on this assessment, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with full confidence. The scores are justified given the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. It poses no security risks based on the provided snippet. The package appears safe and legitimate.",
