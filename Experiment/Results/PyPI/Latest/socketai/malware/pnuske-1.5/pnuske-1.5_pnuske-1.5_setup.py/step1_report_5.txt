  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'pnuske' Python module, defining package metadata and entry point.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools; 'find_packages()' to locate packages; 'entry_points' for command-line interface",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'pnuske:run' function when the command-line script is invoked",
  "flows": "User runs 'pnuske' command -> invokes 'pnuske:run' as entry point; no other data flows or external data sources identified",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs detected. The script is standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for a Python package, utilizing setuptools. It imports necessary functions, specifies package metadata, and sets up a console script entry point. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The entry point references 'pnuske:run', which would execute a function named 'run' in the 'pnuske' module, but that code is not included here for review. The setup script itself does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscated code. It appears to be a straightforward package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for a Python package with a command-line interface. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
