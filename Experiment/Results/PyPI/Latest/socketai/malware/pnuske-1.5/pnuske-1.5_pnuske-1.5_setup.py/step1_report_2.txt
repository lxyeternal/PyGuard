  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python project 'pnuske' with entry point for command-line execution.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools; find_packages() function; setup() arguments including name, version, packages, entry_points.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'pnuske:run' via command line (depends on 'pnuske' module implementation).",
  "flows": "User executes 'pnuske' command -> invokes 'pnuske:run' function (if present) in package.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of standard setup tools and straightforward configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools. It specifies package information and creates a console script entry point. No malicious behavior, no unusual code patterns, and no obfuscated code. The entry point references a 'pnuske' module's 'run' function, which is typical for CLI tools. No suspicious network activity or code injection detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with a command-line interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
