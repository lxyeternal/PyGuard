  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks detected",
  "flows": "Import setuptools -> call setup() with package info and entry point",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded strings appear standard; no suspicious behaviors or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata and entry points. The entry point 'pnuske=pnuske:run' indicates a CLI command linked to the 'run' function in the 'pnuske' module. All elements are standard for Python package setup scripts, with no signs of malicious code or obfuscation. No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with a console entry point. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks.",
