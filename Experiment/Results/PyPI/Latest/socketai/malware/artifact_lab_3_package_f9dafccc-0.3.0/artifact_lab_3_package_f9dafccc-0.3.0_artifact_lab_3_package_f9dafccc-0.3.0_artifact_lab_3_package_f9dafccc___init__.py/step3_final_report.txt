  "purpose": "This is a minimal __init__.py file serving as a package initializer or placeholder with no executable code.",
  "sources": "None; the file contains only comments and no data input or external data reads.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows, external interactions, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist due to lack of code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the file is a standard, empty __init__.py with only comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, empty __init__.py file with only comments indicating it can be left empty or used for initialization. All reviews agree that there is no executable code, data processing, or suspicious activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, standard nature of the file. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The code serves as a placeholder for package initialization, which is common practice in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the scores reflect the true security posture. No changes are necessary.",
