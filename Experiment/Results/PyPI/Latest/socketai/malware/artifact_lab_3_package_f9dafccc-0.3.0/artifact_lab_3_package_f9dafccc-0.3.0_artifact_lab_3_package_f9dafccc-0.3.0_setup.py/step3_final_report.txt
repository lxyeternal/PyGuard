  "purpose": "The code retrieves a Google Cloud metadata token during package installation and exfiltrates it to an external server, indicating malicious intent to steal cloud credentials.",
  "sources": "Fetching token from 'http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token'",
  "sinks": "Sending token data via POST request to 'https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log'",
  "flows": "Code executes 'send_token_to_server()' during setup, which reads the token source and transmits it directly to the external sink",
  "anomalies": "Code runs during package setup, exfiltrates sensitive cloud metadata, and uses an external suspicious URL; straightforward code with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly retrieves a GCE instance token and sends it to an external server during package installation, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. The network requests are direct, with no validation or user consent, and occur in a context that suggests credential theft. The code is clear, not obfuscated, and the activity aligns with known supply chain attack patterns. The scores assigned in reports (malware 0.9, security risk 0.9, obfuscated 0) are consistent with this malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a malicious exfiltration of cloud credentials during package installation, constituting a high-security threat. The scores of 0.9 for malware and risk are justified and appropriate given the activity.",
