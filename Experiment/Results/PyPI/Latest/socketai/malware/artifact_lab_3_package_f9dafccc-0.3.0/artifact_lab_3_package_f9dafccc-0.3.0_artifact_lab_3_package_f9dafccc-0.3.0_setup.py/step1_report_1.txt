  "purpose": "The code attempts to retrieve an instance token from Google Compute Engine metadata and exfiltrate it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Retrieves token from 'http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token' and user environment during execution.",
  "sinks": "Sends the retrieved token to 'https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log' via an HTTP POST request.",
  "flows": "Token is fetched from GCE metadata service (source), then transmitted over the network to an external server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Code executes a network request during package setup, which is unusual behavior for a typical package installation. It attempts to access cloud metadata and exfiltrate sensitive data without user consent. The URL used for exfiltration is suspicious and indicates potential data theft.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'requests' to perform HTTP requests, then defines 'send_token_to_server()' which attempts to retrieve an access token from the Google Cloud metadata server. Upon successful retrieval, it immediately posts this token to an external server, likely for malicious purposes. The function is invoked during the package setup process, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. The URL used for exfiltration is not a standard API endpoint and suggests malicious intent. The code does not validate the token before sending, and the network activity occurs during installation, indicating potential unauthorized data collection and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating sensitive cloud instance tokens during package installation. It is highly suspicious, likely malicious, and poses a security risk. The code attempts to steal cloud instance credentials, which can be used for unauthorized access. It should be considered malicious malware.",
