  "purpose": "The code attempts to retrieve a metadata token from a Google Cloud instance and exfiltrate it to a remote server during package setup.",
  "sources": "Requests token from http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token",
  "sinks": "Sends token data via POST request to a suspicious external URL: https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log",
  "flows": "Code retrieves token from local metadata server -> token stored in variable -> token sent to external server via POST request",
  "anomalies": "The script performs network communication during package installation, exfiltrating potentially sensitive metadata token. The target URL appears suspicious and unrelated to legitimate package functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'requests' and uses it to access the Google Cloud metadata server to obtain an access token. It then attempts to send this token to an external URL, which is a known pattern for data exfiltration. The token retrieval is conditional on a successful response, but the purpose of sending this token is not related to the package's setup or functionality. The network activity occurs during the installation process, which is unusual and potentially malicious. No other suspicious code or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to perform malicious exfiltration of metadata tokens during package installation, indicating likely malicious intent. It leverages the setup process to silently exfiltrate sensitive cloud metadata to an external server. Therefore, it poses a significant security risk and should be considered malicious.",
