  "purpose": "The code attempts to retrieve an access token from Google Compute Engine metadata and send it to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the URL 'http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token' to obtain a token.",
  "sinks": "The code sends the retrieved token via an HTTP POST request to 'https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log'.",
  "flows": "Source: Token obtained from the GCE metadata URL; Sink: Token sent to the external server via POST request.",
  "anomalies": "The code runs a network request to obtain a sensitive token from GCE metadata and exfiltrates it without user consent, which is suspicious behavior. It also executes during package setup, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing modules, then defines a function 'send_token_to_server' which attempts to access the GCE instance metadata URL to retrieve an access token. Upon success, it exfiltrates the token to an external domain using a POST request. This function is called immediately during the package setup process. The package setup appears normal, but the network activity and exfiltration of potentially sensitive tokens during installation are malicious behaviors. The code does not obfuscate its purpose but engages in suspicious network activity, indicating an intent to steal instance credentials. No other malicious code or backdoors are present, but the behavior is clearly malicious in intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script exfiltrates GCE instance tokens during package installation, indicating malicious intent related to credential theft. This behavior constitutes a supply chain attack or malicious package behavior. The overall security risk is high due to the secret exfiltration during setup.",
