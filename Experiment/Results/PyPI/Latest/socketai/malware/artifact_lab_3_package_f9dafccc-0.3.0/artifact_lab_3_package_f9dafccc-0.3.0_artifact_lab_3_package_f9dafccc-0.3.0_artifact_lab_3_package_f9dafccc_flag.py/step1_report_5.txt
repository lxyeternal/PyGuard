  "purpose": "The script attempts to retrieve a Google Cloud instance metadata token and exfiltrate it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token' to obtain the token.",
  "sinks": "POST request to 'https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log' with the token as data.",
  "flows": "Token fetched from local metadata URL (source) flows directly into a POST request to an external domain (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Code automatically retrieves a cloud instance token and exfiltrates it to an external server without user consent. No input validation or user interaction involved.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to obtain a cloud instance's access token via the metadata server and then send this token to an external server. This behavior resembles credential theft or secret exfiltration, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The code does not perform any benign or intended functionality beyond this exfiltration. It does not contain obfuscated code, but the behavior itself is indicative of malicious activity. The try-except blocks are standard, but they do not mitigate the malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to steal a Google Cloud instance's metadata token and send it to an external server, indicating malicious intent. It acts as a credential exfiltration tool, which is a high security risk.",
