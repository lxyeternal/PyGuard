  "purpose": "The script retrieves a Google Cloud instance token from the metadata URL and exfiltrates it to an external server, indicating malicious credential theft.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to 'http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token'",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to 'https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log' with the token data",
  "flows": "Source: metadata URL fetch -> Sink: external URL POST with token data",
  "anomalies": "Automatic execution upon script run, exfiltration of sensitive cloud credentials to a suspicious external domain, no input validation, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code fetches a cloud metadata token and immediately sends it to an external server, indicating credential theft. It runs automatically without user input, with no obfuscation, and uses a suspicious URL. The behavior is clearly malicious, designed to exfiltrate sensitive cloud credentials. Error handling is minimal but present. The external URL is associated with testing or tracking services, further indicating malicious intent. The code's straightforward nature and the exfiltration pattern confirm malicious activity. Scores of malware and security risk are high (0.9), consistent with credential theft and exfiltration, while obfuscation score is 0 due to lack of obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious credential exfiltration from cloud metadata, representing a high security threat. It is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and exfiltrates sensitive tokens to a suspicious external URL. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The code should be flagged as malicious with a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9.",
