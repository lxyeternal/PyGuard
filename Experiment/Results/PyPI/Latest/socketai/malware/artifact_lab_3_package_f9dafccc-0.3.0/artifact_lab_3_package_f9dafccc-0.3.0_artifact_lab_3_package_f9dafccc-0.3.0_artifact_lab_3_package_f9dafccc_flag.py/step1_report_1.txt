{
  "purpose": "The script attempts to retrieve an identity token from Google Cloud metadata service and then exfiltrates it to a remote server, possibly for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the metadata URL 'http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token'.",
  "sinks": "The token is sent via an HTTP POST request to 'https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log'.",
  "flows": "Source: metadata URL fetch → token stored in variable → sink: token sent via POST request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code fetches a token from the cloud metadata service and exfiltrates it without any user interaction or explicit permission. The external URL is suspicious and likely malicious. No input validation or checks are performed before exfiltration. The code runs upon import, indicating potential malicious automation.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to access the Google Cloud metadata service to retrieve a service account token. It then immediately posts this token to an external domain controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates an intent to steal cloud instance credentials. The code handles errors gracefully but does not restrict or log its actions beyond print statements. The URL used for exfiltration is suspicious, consistent with malicious data theft. There are no obfuscation techniques or malicious payloads beyond this exfiltration process. The function executes automatically when the script is run, increasing the likelihood of malicious activity.\n\nOverall, this code performs credential theft by exfiltrating a cloud instance token, which could be used for further malicious access or lateral movement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to steal cloud instance tokens and exfiltrate them to a remote server. It does not contain obfuscation but performs suspicious operations that indicate malicious intent, specifically credential theft from cloud environments.",
