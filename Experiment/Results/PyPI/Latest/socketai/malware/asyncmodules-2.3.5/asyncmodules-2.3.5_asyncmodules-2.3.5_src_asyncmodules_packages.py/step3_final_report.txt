  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by aliasing modules ('urllib3', 'idna', and optionally 'chardet') under the 'requests.packages' namespace through manipulation of sys.modules.",
  "sources": "Imports modules ('urllib3', 'idna', 'chardet') and reads from sys.modules to perform aliasing.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.modules entries to redirect module references under 'requests.packages'.",
  "flows": "Imports modules, then updates sys.modules entries to alias these modules under a different namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual manipulation of sys.modules for namespace aliasing; no malicious code or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs namespace aliasing for legacy support, which involves importing specific modules and reassigning their entries in sys.modules. This pattern is known but unconventional, and while it can be exploited if environment is compromised, it is not inherently malicious. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or contain obfuscated/malicious code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the pattern. The confidence levels are high, reflecting a clear understanding of the code's benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a compatibility function with no malicious intent. The manipulation of sys.modules is unusual but not malicious. The low risk score (around 0.2) is justified, considering potential misuse if environment security is compromised. Malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The overall assessment indicates a safe pattern, with a cautious stance due to the unconventional module aliasing.",
