{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for the Requests library to handle various HTTP and network errors.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data; it only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing or leakage are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exception hierarchies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for the Requests library. It imports standard exceptions, defines subclasses for various network errors, and includes docstrings for clarity. No data input, output, or external interactions are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The structure and content are consistent with standard Python exception definitions. The presence of specialized exceptions like ConnectionError, HTTPError, and Timeout aligns with typical network error handling patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a typical set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign component meant for error handling, with no hidden or harmful functionalities.",
