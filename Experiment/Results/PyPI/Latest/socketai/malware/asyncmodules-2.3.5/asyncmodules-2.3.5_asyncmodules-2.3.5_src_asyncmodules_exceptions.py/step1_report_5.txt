  "purpose": "Define a set of exception classes for handling errors and warnings in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code defines exception classes and imports external exceptions from urllib3 and compat modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; exceptions are used for error handling only.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code primarily defines exception classes with standard inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for various exceptions related to HTTP requests, errors, and warnings. It imports external exception classes and extends them appropriately. The __init__ methods and __reduce__ methods are standard for exception handling and pickling, with no signs of malicious logic. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. Overall, the code is straightforward and conforms to common Python practices for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a set of exception definitions for the Requests library without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It contains no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is standard and secure.",
