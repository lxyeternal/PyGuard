  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward exception class hierarchy for the Requests library. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks are observed.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (or lower).  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues found. The risk score could be 0 since there's no potential for harm.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the standard nature of the exception definitions, with no suspicious behavior. Slight mention of potential data leakage if untrusted data influences exception handling, but no actual evidence of such.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The low risk score reflects the standard exception definitions with minimal concern.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports—standard exception classes, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above—standard exception hierarchy, no malicious code or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, a standard exception module with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code only defines exception classes, imports external exceptions, and uses standard inheritance. No code execution, no embedded payloads, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.  \n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports. No evidence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscation:** 0 across all reports. The code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign very low or zero risk, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical exception hierarchy for a Python HTTP request library.  \n- No suspicious patterns, no external command execution, no embedded malicious code, and no obfuscation.  \n- The exception classes serve error handling purposes only, with no indication of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### **Estimated final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0** (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.1 at most, but zero is justified)  \n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard exception module with no security risks or malicious intent.",
