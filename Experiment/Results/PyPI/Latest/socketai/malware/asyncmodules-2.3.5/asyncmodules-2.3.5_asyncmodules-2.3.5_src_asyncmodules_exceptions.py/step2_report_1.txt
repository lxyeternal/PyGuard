  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward set of exception class definitions for the Requests library.\n- They highlight the import of external exceptions, inheritance structures, and standard Python exception handling patterns.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is identified.\n- The code does not process untrusted data beyond standard exception handling, nor does it perform any external or network operations.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1.0), indicating strong agreement that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws.\n- It solely defines exception classes, with no evidence of code injection, backdoors, or data leaks.\n- No untrusted data flows, external code execution, or secrets are present.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws are apparent; the code is standard for exception class definitions.\n- The inheritance and __init__ methods are correctly implemented.\n- The use of __reduce__ for pickling is appropriate and standard.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low or zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The **malware score** is 0 because there's no malicious activity, code injection, or backdoors.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0 because the code is clear, standard, and not obfuscated.\n- The **risk score** is near zero, reflecting that this code does not introduce security risks.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- No discrepancies are observed; the scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but a slight margin for residual uncertainty)  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- The code is a standard exception hierarchy, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior.  \n- The minimal security risk (0.1) is acceptable as a conservative estimate, considering the potential for misused exception data, but overall, it's benign.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe code is a typical, well-structured exception class module for the Requests library, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate, and there is no need for adjustments.",
