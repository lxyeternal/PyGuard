  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling errors and warnings in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exceptions from urllib3 and compatibility modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external output occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines exception classes and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code strictly defines exception classes and imports, with standard inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code imports external exceptions and defines various custom exception classes for the Requests library. All classes inherit from standard Python exceptions or other defined exceptions, with no evidence of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The code structure and naming are consistent with standard exception handling modules. No signs of code injection or security flaws are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward exception class hierarchy for the Requests library, with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a structured way to handle errors in HTTP requests and related warnings without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
