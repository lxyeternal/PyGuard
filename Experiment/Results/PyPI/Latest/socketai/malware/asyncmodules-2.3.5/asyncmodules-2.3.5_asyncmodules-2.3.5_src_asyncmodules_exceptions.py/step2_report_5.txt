  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard exception class hierarchy for the Requests library.\n- It imports exceptions from external modules (urllib3.exceptions, .compat.JSONDecodeError).\n- All classes inherit from standard Python exceptions or other defined exceptions.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, or external outputs are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for error handling modules.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of exception class definitions**: All reports correctly identify that these are exception classes, with no malicious code.\n- **Imports from external modules**: Import statements are standard and do not introduce malicious behavior.\n- **No data flows or external outputs**: The code only defines classes; no data is processed or leaked.\n- **No obfuscation or suspicious patterns**: The code is clear and follows standard practices.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere are **no malicious behaviors, security flaws, or obfuscation** in this code.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|----------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0              | 0                | 0            | Standard exception class definitions; no malicious code. |\n| 2       | 0              | 0                | 0.1          | Slightly higher due to potential data in exceptions, but still benign. No malicious intent. |\n| 3       | 0              | 0                | 0            | Straightforward, standard exception classes. |\n| 4       | 0              | 0                | 0            | No suspicious patterns; standard exception hierarchy. |\n| 5       | 0              | 0                | 0            | Typical exception definitions; no issues. |\n\n**Note:** The small security risk score (~0.1) in report 2 is likely due to the possibility of exception objects containing sensitive data (like request/response objects). This is standard and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and obfuscation scores:\n- All reports correctly identify **malware = 0**.\n- All reports correctly identify **obfuscated = 0**.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in each report are reasonable.\n- The overall assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.05, considering potential data sensitivity but no malicious intent)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical, well-structured exception hierarchy for an HTTP request library, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The reported scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain component is safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and minimal security risk inherent to exception class definitions.",
