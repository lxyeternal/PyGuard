{
  "purpose": "This module defines various exception classes related to HTTP requests and network errors for a requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the Python standard exceptions, external library imports (urllib3.exceptions, .compat.JSONDecodeError), and class initialization parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous if untrusted data influences exception handling or logging; no explicit sinks are present, but misuse of exception data could leak information.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated with data possibly originating from network responses or request parameters, but no data flows to external systems or network in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes related to HTTP and network errors, extending from standard Python exceptions and external library exceptions. It imports exceptions, defines custom exceptions, and manages inheritance carefully to preserve exception behavior. The __init__ methods assign response/request objects, which could contain sensitive data, but this is standard for exception handling. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious logic is evident. The code structure and comments suggest it is a standard, well-maintained exception module without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of exception class definitions for an HTTP request library. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. There are no signs of supply chain attacks or hidden malicious logic.",
