{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of exception classes for the Requests library, handling various HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "Import of external exceptions (urllib3.exceptions.HTTPError), internal class initializations, and attributes related to request and response objects.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; exception handling and attribute assignments do not process external inputs or leak data.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and propagation; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; standard error handling pattern.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions for the Requests library. It imports external exceptions, defines custom exceptions, and manages inheritance properly. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The exception classes serve error handling purposes only, with no external data processing or network activity. The code does not process untrusted data beyond standard exception context, and no secrets or backdoors are embedded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard exception hierarchy module for the Requests library, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the analysis.",
