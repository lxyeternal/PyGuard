  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is standard, with no malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It emphasizes proper handling of URL parsing, encoding, hooks, cookies, and response decoding. The confidence is high (0.95), and malware is scored 0.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or network connections to suspicious domains. The functions and classes serve typical request/response handling.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues found. The report's conclusion aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe encoding, request/response handling, and no malicious activity. Confidence is 0.9, malware 0.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code performs standard request construction, encoding, and response parsing. No signs of malicious payloads or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the analysis indicates standard HTTP request/response management with no malicious or backdoor behaviors. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code handles URL parsing, IDNA encoding, header validation, multipart encoding, and response decoding securely and conventionally.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report finds the code to be a typical, well-structured HTTP client component with no malicious intent. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The functions and classes follow expected patterns for request/response handling, with no suspicious logic.\n\n- **Verdict:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is standard, with no backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious routines. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code performs request and response management securely, with no hidden behaviors.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The use of external libraries (urllib3, chardet, json) is standard.\n- No network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration routines, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code handles encoding, URL parsing, headers, cookies, and response decoding properly.\n\n### **Scores Justification:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n- **Risk:** The overall security risk is very low (around 0.1-0.2), which is appropriate.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, given the code's purpose and no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a core component of an HTTP request library, implementing request and response handling securely and transparently. The reports are consistent, and based on the code, there are no signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores; no changes needed.",
