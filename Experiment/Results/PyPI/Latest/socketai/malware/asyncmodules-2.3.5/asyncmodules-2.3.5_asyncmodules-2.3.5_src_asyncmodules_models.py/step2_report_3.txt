  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes core classes/functions for HTTP request/response handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from user inputs to request preparation, and response content is read and decoded.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Usage of standard libraries and encoding practices are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is secure and free of malware aligns with the detailed review. The high confidence (0.95) is justified.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, given the code's purpose and no issues)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard request construction with potential sensitive data in request bodies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into encoding, headers, and response parsing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No backdoors or malicious behaviors. Proper handling of encoding, hooks, cookies, and request formation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a legitimate HTTP client component, with no malicious activity. Confidence of 0.9 is reasonable.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (still low, considering the functions involved)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard request/response handling with input from URL, headers, data, files, cookies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Typical data flow for request encoding and response processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries and practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears secure and standard. Confidence 0.9 is justified.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, standard request/response management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into request setup and response decoding.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation. All functions are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, secure code. Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard handling of request and response data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Typical data flow, no suspicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behaviors or obfuscation. Uses well-known libraries.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity detected. Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an HTTP client library (Requests). No signs of malware, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across all reports. This aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 in some reports (0.1–0.2), which is reasonable given the code's nature—handling sensitive data, but no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to handling of potentially sensitive data but no actual issues)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a secure, standard implementation of HTTP request/response handling within the Requests library. No malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage detected. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
