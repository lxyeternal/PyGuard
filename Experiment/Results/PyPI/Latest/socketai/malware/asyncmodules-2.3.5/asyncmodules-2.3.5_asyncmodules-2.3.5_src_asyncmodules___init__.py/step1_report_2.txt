{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a Python HTTP library named ModernReqs, providing functions for making HTTP requests and managing dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (warnings, base64, urllib3, logging), local modules (exceptions, api, models, sessions, status_codes), and an embedded base64-encoded script executed via exec().",
  "sinks": "Potentially malicious code could be in the executed base64 script, which is decoded and run dynamically with exec(). This code could be a source of malicious behavior if it is intentionally harmful.",
  "flows": "The embedded base64-encoded script (likely some obfuscated or malicious code) is decoded and executed at runtime, creating a source-to-sink flow that can execute arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with dynamically decoded base64 data is highly suspicious, indicating potential obfuscation or malicious intent. The embedded script appears lengthy and complex, which is atypical for standard library code.",
  "analysis": "The main code structure follows standard practices for a Python library, importing dependencies and defining functions. However, at the beginning, a base64 string is decoded and executed with exec(), which is a common tactic for hiding malicious payloads. The rest of the code involves dependency checks and setup routines. The presence of exec() with a base64-encoded payload constitutes a significant anomaly and potential security risk, as it allows arbitrary code execution at runtime. No other suspicious or malicious functions are evident outside this obfuscated segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious or suspicious component—an embedded base64-encoded script executed dynamically—which could be used to perform malicious activities. The rest of the code appears to be standard library setup and dependency checks, but the exec() usage warrants caution.",
