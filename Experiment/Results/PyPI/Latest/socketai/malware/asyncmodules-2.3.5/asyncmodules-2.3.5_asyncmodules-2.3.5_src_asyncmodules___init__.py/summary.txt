  "conclusion": "The code embeds an obfuscated base64 payload executed via exec(), which upon decoding performs malicious activities such as network communication and system manipulation. The consistent pattern across multiple reports and the decoded payload's behavior justify classifying this as highly malicious with maximum security risk. The package should be flagged for removal or further forensic analysis before deployment."
