{
  "purpose": "This code implements an HTTP library in Python, providing functions for GET, POST, and other HTTP methods, along with dependency checks and warnings.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party dependencies (charset_normalizer, chardet, urllib3, cryptography), and embedded base64-decoded code executed via exec.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decoded code, warnings, and import statements that could potentially be exploited if the decoded code is malicious.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded and executed via exec(), which could run arbitrary code; dependency checks and warnings are also part of the flow, but they are standard practices.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a base64-encoded string decoded and executed dynamically is highly unusual and suspicious, especially since it is embedded directly in the source code. This pattern can be used to obfuscate malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency checks and sets up an HTTP library, which appears standard. However, it includes a base64-encoded string that is decoded and executed dynamically with exec(). This obfuscated code is not part of typical library design and poses a significant security risk. The rest of the code mainly involves dependency verification, warnings, and standard library imports, which are benign. The embedded code, once decoded, may contain malicious logic, backdoors, or unwanted behaviors, making the overall risk high.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically executed code via base64 decoding and exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent or sabotage. Although the rest of the code appears standard for an HTTP library, the embedded and executed code significantly elevates the risk level. Therefore, this package is potentially malicious and should be considered unsafe until further analysis of the decoded code is performed.",
