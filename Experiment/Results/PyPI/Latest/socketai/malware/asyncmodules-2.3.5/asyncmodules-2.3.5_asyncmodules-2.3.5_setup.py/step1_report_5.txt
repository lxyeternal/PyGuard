{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, managing dependencies and package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '__version__.py' and reading the README.md file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable misuse detected.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and README content, then passes data into 'setup()' for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads version info via 'exec' without validation; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: verifying Python version, handling publish command, reading package metadata, and configuring package installation requirements. The use of 'exec' to load version info is common but can be risky if the file is tampered with, though no malicious activity is evident. There are no network connections, hidden code, or unusual behaviors. All operations are typical for a setup script, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious behavior. It performs typical package configuration tasks securely, with no suspicious patterns or malware indicators.",
