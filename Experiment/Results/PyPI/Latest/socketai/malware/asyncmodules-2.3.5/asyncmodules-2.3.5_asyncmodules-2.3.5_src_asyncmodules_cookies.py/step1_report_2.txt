{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities and a cookie management implementation for the requests library, including cookie extraction, setting, and manipulation.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules, standard libraries (calendar, copy, time, threading), and external modules (`_internal_utils`, `compat`, `cookielib`, `urlparse`, `urlunparse`).",
  "sinks": "Methods that handle cookie headers, cookie extraction, cookie setting/removal, and cookie iteration. Notably, `extract_cookies_to_jar`, `get_cookie_header`, and cookie manipulation functions.",
  "flows": "Input data from HTTP request objects and HTTP response headers flow into cookie extraction, cookie setting, and cookie header generation functions. Cookie data is stored/modified in CookieJar instances, which are used in these flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation. No code that executes external commands or network connections. Usage of standard library functions appears normal and appropriate for cookie management.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily offers utility classes and functions for cookie handling, including mock request/response wrappers, cookie extraction from responses, cookie header construction, and cookie jar manipulation. The implementation is consistent with standard cookie management practices. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden network activity, or code injection is evident. The functions do not perform any actions outside typical cookie operations, and external inputs are confined to cookie-related data. The code does not contain obfuscated logic or unusual control flows that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of cookie handling utilities for the requests library, designed to support cookie management and compatibility. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears legitimate, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
