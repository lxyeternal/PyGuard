  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies with the requests library, including mock request/response objects, cookie extraction, and cookie jar management functions.",
  "sources": "Code reads request URLs, headers, cookies, and cookie attributes; functions accept external request objects, cookie dictionaries, and response headers.",
  "sinks": "Cookie header construction, cookie storage/modification, cookie extraction, and cookie deletion. No external network or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Request data (URL, headers, cookies) flows into cookie extraction and header generation functions; cookies are stored/modified in cookie jars; no network or external system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; all functions perform standard cookie handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code offers standard cookie handling utilities compatible with requests and urllib3. It includes mock request/response classes, cookie extraction from responses, cookie header generation, cookie removal, and cookie jar manipulation. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses standard Python libraries and well-documented approaches for cookie management. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior observed. The functions serve legitimate purposes in cookie handling within the context of HTTP requests.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, legitimate utility for cookie management in HTTP client libraries. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior identified. The implementation aligns with common practices for handling cookies and maintaining compatibility across libraries.",
