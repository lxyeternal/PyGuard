{
  "purpose": "Provides cookie management utilities, including mock request/response classes, cookie extraction, creation, and jar manipulation for compatibility with http.cookiejar.",
  "sources": "Reads request URL, headers, and cookie attributes; no external data sources or network activity.",
  "sinks": "Generates cookie headers, extracts cookies into jar, modifies cookie jar, and deletes cookies by name.",
  "flows": "Request URL and headers -> cookie extraction and header creation -> cookie jar updates and cookie deletion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie handling functions, mock classes for compatibility, and cookie jar management. No external network calls, no obfuscation, and no malicious logic are present. The functions follow typical patterns for cookie extraction, creation, and management, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of cookie utilities for the requests library. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation.",
