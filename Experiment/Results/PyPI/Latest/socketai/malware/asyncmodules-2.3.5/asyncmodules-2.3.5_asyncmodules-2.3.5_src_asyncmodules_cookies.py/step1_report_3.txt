  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and utility functions for managing cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, manipulation, and conversion between different formats.",
  "sources": "Reading request URL, headers, and cookies; reading response headers; accessing cookies via iteration and dict-like access; converting cookies and cookie jars.",
  "sinks": "Adding headers to requests; setting, removing, or updating cookies; extracting cookies into jar; converting cookies to string headers.",
  "flows": "Request URL and headers -> MockRequest methods; response headers -> MockResponse; response objects -> extract_cookies_to_jar; cookie data -> create_cookie / morsel_to_cookie -> CookieJar; cookie jars -> get_cookie_header / set / update / remove.",
  "anomalies": "Use of mock classes to interface with request/response objects; extensive cookie management functions that do not appear to perform any malicious activity; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution observed; cookie handling appears standard for the purpose of managing cookies.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of classes and functions for cookie management within the requests library, including wrapping request and response objects for cookie processing, creating and manipulating cookie objects, and converting between formats. The implementation includes custom classes to ensure compatibility and functionality, with no evident malicious logic such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or backdoors. The use of mock classes is to facilitate cookie handling and appears consistent with standard practice. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code is well-structured, primarily focused on cookie management, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured utility module for managing cookies in the requests library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The functions and classes serve to facilitate cookie extraction, storage, and transfer without performing any suspicious or harmful actions.",
