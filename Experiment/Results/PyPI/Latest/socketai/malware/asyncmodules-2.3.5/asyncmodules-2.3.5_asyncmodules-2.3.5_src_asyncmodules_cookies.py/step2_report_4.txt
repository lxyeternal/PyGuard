  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code provides compatibility utilities for cookie handling, with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity. The functions serve legitimate purposes, and no obfuscation or backdoors are evident.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard cookie management, compatibility, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code is primarily utility functions for cookie handling, with no suspicious logic.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on cookie extraction, creation, and manipulation, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The functions perform typical cookie operations. No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights standard cookie management, with emphasis on the lack of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The only point is a slightly elevated securityRisk score (0.1). Given the code's purpose, this seems overly cautious.\n- **Recommendation:** The code does not perform any risky operations; the minor securityRisk score should be lowered to 0.0 for consistency and accuracy.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no external system calls, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates standard cookie handling, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard, legitimate cookie management utilities.\n- The only point of contention is the slightly elevated securityRisk score in Report 4, which should be adjusted downward.\n\n### Final malware and obfuscated scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no signs of malicious code across all reports)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** Considering the code's nature, I would assign a risk score of **0.0** overall, as it’s purely utility code with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     (adjusted from 0.1) |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores should reflect this, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.",
