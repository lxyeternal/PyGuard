  "purpose": "Provides utility classes and functions for managing cookies compatible with requests, including cookie extraction, creation, and manipulation within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Reads input from request objects (e.g., request URL, headers, cookies), and from response objects (headers and message).",
  "sinks": "Generates Cookie headers for requests, modifies or clears cookies in the CookieJar, extracts cookies from responses into the jar.",
  "flows": "Request data flows from request headers and URL to cookie extraction; response headers flow into cookie extraction into jar; cookie creation functions generate cookies based on inputs; cookie manipulation functions alter or read cookies in the jar.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution; all functions perform standard cookie management operations. No network or system commands are executed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation for cookie management compatible with the requests library. It defines classes for wrapping requests and responses for cookie processing, functions for extracting cookies from responses, generating cookie headers, and managing cookie jars. The CookieJar subclasses support dictionary-like operations, with methods for setting, getting, deleting, and copying cookies. The create_cookie and morsel_to_cookie functions generate cookies from input parameters and Morsel objects respectively. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All functions appear to serve legitimate cookie handling purposes. No external network activity, code injection, or system manipulation code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It facilitates cookie handling but does not contain any harmful or sabotage-related functionality.",
