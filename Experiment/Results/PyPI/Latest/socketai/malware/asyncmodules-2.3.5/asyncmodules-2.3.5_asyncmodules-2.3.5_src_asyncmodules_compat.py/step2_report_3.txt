  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code is primarily a compatibility and utility setup module for Python 2/3, handling imports, version detection, and optional dependencies such as chardet, charset_normalizer, and simplejson.\n- None of the reports identify any malicious behavior, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.\n- The code performs standard environment detection, safe dynamic imports, and sets up compatibility variables.\n- No untrusted data is processed, and no network or file operations are performed with untrusted inputs.\n- The reports consistently assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risks of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code matches exactly what is described in the reports.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No apparent errors; fallback mechanisms and version checks are standard.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n  - Risk: 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- The dynamic import via `importlib.import_module()` is standard and controlled.\n- No data is processed from untrusted sources.\n- No network or file operations involve untrusted data.\n- The code's purpose is environment setup, not data handling or processing.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\n\nThe scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and align with the code's functionality. There are no indications of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe compatibility module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
