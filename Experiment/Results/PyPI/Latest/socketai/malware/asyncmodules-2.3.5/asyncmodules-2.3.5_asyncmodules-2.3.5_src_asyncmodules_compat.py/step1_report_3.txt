{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and utility functions for handling different Python versions and HTTP-related operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as importlib, sys, urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, json/simplejson, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request",
  "sinks": "Potential import errors or fallback imports, no direct data sinks or external outputs present",
  "flows": "Import modules -> assign variables based on imports -> define functions -> assign flags based on environment -> fallback imports if necessary",
  "anomalies": "None of the code performs any unusual actions; fallback imports are standard practice, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, module import compatibility, and version handling in a standard manner for cross-version Python support. It employs typical try-except blocks to handle optional dependencies, and assigns module references accordingly. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or suspicious logic. The module's design aligns with common compatibility shims, with no indication of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility module for handling different Python versions and HTTP library variations. It performs safe imports and environment detection without any suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no security concerns or malicious code present.",
