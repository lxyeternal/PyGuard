  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to verify the claims, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly states that the module handles compatibility, imports modules, detects versions, and sets variables accordingly. No data sinks or external data processing are present. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is standard for compatibility handling, with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes safe imports, environment detection, and no processing of untrusted data. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are identified.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. All operations are safe and standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on import statements, version detection, and fallback mechanisms. Finds no suspicious behavior or anomalies.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's import and version detection logic are typical and safe. No malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the dynamic import via `importlib.import_module()` in `_resolve_char_detection()`. Recognizes that dynamic import is controlled and safe here, with no user input or external data involved.\n\n- **Assessment:** The dynamic import is standard for optional dependencies and is safely contained. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes the import statements, version detection, and lack of data leaks or malicious code. Finds no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code. No malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is straightforward, performing compatibility imports, version detection, and optional module imports. No data processing, no network operations, no user input handling, and no obfuscated or malicious code are present.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify the absence of malware and obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risk:** The code is purely setup and compatibility logic, with no evident security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n**Additional note:** The dynamic import via `importlib.import_module()` is standard practice for optional dependencies and does not introduce security concerns in this context.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is a standard, safe compatibility module with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
