  "purpose": "Compatibility handling and utility functions for Python 2 and 3, including version detection, optional library imports, and environment setup.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info, imports optional modules (chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson), detects urllib3 version.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; only internal setup and import resolution.",
  "flows": "Import statements and version detection logic; controlled dynamic import of optional modules.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard import and environment detection patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, manages optional dependencies via controlled importlib.import_module(), and sets compatibility variables. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated/malicious code. The dynamic import is safe and limited to known modules. No security issues or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe compatibility and utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate benign, routine setup code.",
