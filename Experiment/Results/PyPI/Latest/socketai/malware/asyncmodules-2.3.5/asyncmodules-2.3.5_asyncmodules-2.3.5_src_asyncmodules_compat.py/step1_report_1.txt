{
  "purpose": "This module handles compatibility and utility functions for HTTP requests, character detection, and Python version differences.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information from urllib3 and sys modules, attempts to import character detection libraries ('chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'), and loads various standard library modules such as json, collections, http, io, urllib, and built-in types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; no data is being sent over the network or written to disk. No functions that handle user input or untrusted data directly are invoked in this code.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, detecting library versions, and defining compatibility variables. There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; it mainly sets up environment and compatibility checks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors detected. The code strictly performs imports, version checks, and defines constants for compatibility. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily focused on environment setup, compatibility, and module imports. It attempts to import optional libraries with fallbacks and defines variables for Python version detection. It does not process or handle external or untrusted data, nor does it contain suspicious or malicious logic. All actions are standard for such compatibility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard compatibility and utility setup module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports necessary modules, detects environment details, and sets compatibility variables, with no indication of any malicious intent or malicious code.",
