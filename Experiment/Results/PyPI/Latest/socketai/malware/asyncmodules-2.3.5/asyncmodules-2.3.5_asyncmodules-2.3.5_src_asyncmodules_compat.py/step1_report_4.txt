{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility utilities and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and for importing certain libraries conditionally.",
  "sources": "Import statements (importlib, sys, urllib3, simplejson, json, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request). Function _resolve_char_detection() which dynamically imports either 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic imports within _resolve_char_detection(), use of importlib.import_module() - potential risk if importlib is manipulated, but generally safe in this context.",
  "flows": "Dynamic import of chardet/charset_normalizer via importlib.import_module(), no other untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The only dynamic code execution occurs via importlib.import_module(), which is controlled and safe here. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation. No signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles compatibility issues with different Python versions and tries to import modules like simplejson, chardet, or charset_normalizer. All dynamic imports are limited to known, safe modules. No user input or external data sources are involved. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The dynamic import mechanism is standard practice for optional dependencies. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility and import utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs safe imports and version detection without any suspicious activity.",
