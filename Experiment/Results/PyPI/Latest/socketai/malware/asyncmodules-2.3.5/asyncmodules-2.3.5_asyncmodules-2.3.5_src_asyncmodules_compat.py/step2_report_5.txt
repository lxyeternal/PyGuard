  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a compatibility and utility module primarily for handling differences between Python 2 and 3, managing optional dependencies like chardet and simplejson, and importing standard libraries.\n- It performs version detection, conditional imports, and sets up environment variables.\n- There are no data processing, network operations, or user input handling within this snippet.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The dynamic import via importlib is controlled and limited to known modules.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **No issues are present.** The code is standard for such compatibility modules.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **None detected.** The code is straightforward, well-structured, and follows common practices.\n\n### Scores given in reports:\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0 or very close to zero\n- These are reasonable, given the code's nature.\n\n### Justification for risk and malware scores:\n- **Risk score (0):** The code only performs imports and environment detection; no external data handling or network activity occurs.\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious behavior, payload, or backdoors are present.\n\n### Potential assumptions or vulnerabilities:\n- Some reports mention the dynamic import via importlib, but this is safe here since the modules are known and controlled.\n- No evidence of code obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent with the code's nature and content.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, and standard.\n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, well-implemented compatibility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. All scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' assessments.",
