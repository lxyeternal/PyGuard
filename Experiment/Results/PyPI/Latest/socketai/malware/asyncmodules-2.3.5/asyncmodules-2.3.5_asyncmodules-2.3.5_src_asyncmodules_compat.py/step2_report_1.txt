  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Compatibility and utility functions.\n- Sources: Reads version info, imports optional libraries, sets environment variables.\n- Sinks: No data processing or external data handling.\n- Flows: Import and setup only.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Standard import and environment detection code, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, routine setup code.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Compatibility handling and utility functions.\n- Sources: Version info, optional modules.\n- Sinks: No data sinks, just imports.\n- Flows: Setup code, no data flow.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Straightforward compatibility code, safe imports.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Compatibility utilities.\n- Sources: Imports, dynamic import of chardet/charset_normalizer.\n- Sinks: Dynamic import via importlib, but safe in context.\n- Flows: Dynamic import controlled, no untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard pattern for optional dependencies, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard compatibility code.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Compatibility functions, import management.\n- Sources: Standard libraries, version detection, dynamic import.\n- Sinks: No data leaks or external effects.\n- Flows: Import and setup only.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Routine import handling, no suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Compatibility and import setup.\n- Sources: Imports, version detection, dynamic import.\n- Sinks: No data flow or external data processing.\n- Flows: Import statements, no untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard cross-version support code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard compatibility and utility setup module.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is detected.\n- The code performs safe imports, version detection, and environment setup.\n- The malware scores in all reports are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**My final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, safe compatibility module with no issues from a security perspective.",
