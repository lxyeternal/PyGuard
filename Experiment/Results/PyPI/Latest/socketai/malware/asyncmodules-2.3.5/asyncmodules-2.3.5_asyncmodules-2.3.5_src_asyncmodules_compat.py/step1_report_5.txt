{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions for different Python versions and manages imports for various libraries used in HTTP requests and data handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (importlib, sys, collections, http, io, urllib), version detection for urllib3, dynamic import of chardet or charset_normalizer, optional import of simplejson.",
  "sinks": "None of the sources lead to data leaks or external effects directly; import statements do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and sets up variables, with no data flow from external untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code performs standard compatibility and import handling.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses on compatibility and import management, using try-except blocks to handle optional dependencies and version differences. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling is observed. The import patterns and version checks are standard for cross-version support. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a compatibility module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs routine setup tasks for a larger project without any suspicious or harmful logic.",
