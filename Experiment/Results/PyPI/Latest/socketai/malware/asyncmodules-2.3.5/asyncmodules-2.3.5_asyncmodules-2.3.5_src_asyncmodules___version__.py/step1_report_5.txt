  "purpose": "Define metadata for the Python library 'asyncmodules'.",
  "sources": "Constants defining package metadata (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks for untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code simply assigns metadata strings.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of decorative ASCII art and emoji characters, but no malicious code or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments for package metadata, including version, author, license, and descriptive fields. The URL points to 'https://google.com', which is a generic placeholder and not suspicious. No input reading, data leaks, or external communication occurs. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as metadata definitions for a Python package. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies detected.",
