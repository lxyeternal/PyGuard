  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments that describe metadata about the package such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright. There are no functions, external input handling, or dynamic code execution. The ASCII art comment is decorative and not suspicious. All variables are static strings or integers, with no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
