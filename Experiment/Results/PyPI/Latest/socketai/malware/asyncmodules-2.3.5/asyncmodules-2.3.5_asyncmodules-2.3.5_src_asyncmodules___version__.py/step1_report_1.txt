  "purpose": "Define metadata attributes for the Python package 'asyncmodules'.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input; only assigns string and numeric values to module-level variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause harm are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets static attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected. The use of Unicode characters in '__cake__' is benign and decorative.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and consists solely of variable assignments defining package metadata. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no code execution, and no third-party library usage. The URLs, email, and other data appear legitimate and standard. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as package metadata definitions. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
