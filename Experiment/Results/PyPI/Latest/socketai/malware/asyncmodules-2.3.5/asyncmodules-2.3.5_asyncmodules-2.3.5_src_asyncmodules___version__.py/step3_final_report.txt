  "purpose": "Define package metadata including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, copyright, and decorative elements.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments; no external input or data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative ASCII art comment and Unicode emoji in __cake__, but these are benign and purely decorative.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with no functions, dynamic code, or external data handling. The ASCII art and Unicode characters are decorative. The URL points to 'https://google.com', a benign placeholder. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, with confidence scores of 1. The reasoning is consistent and accurate. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm the absence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package metadata declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
