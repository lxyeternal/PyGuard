  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'asyncmodules' Python library, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and other information.",
  "sources": "Constants assignment statements setting module-level variables (__title__, __description__, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code only assigns string and numeric values to variables.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources or flow of data from input to output; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code appears to be straightforward metadata definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module-level metadata variables using static string and numeric literals. There are no function calls, no input handling, nor dynamic code execution. The URL points to 'https://google.com', which is benign and unlikely to be malicious. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors are present. Overall, the code is a simple metadata declaration typical for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata for a Python package and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign module definition.",
