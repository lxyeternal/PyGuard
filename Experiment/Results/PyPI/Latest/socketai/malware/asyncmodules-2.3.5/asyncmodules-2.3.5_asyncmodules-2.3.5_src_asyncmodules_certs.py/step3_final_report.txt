{
  "purpose": "Outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' and the call to 'where()' function.",
  "sinks": "The code prints the path; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' -> call to 'where()' -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, minimal code with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a trusted function from a well-known library and prints its output. It does not process untrusted input, perform network activity, or execute dynamic code. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious logic are present. The purpose is utility, and the code is benign. All signals indicate no malware or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe utility script that retrieves and prints the trusted CA bundle path. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero; the security risk is negligible. Overall, the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
