  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code simply imports `where` from `certifi` and prints it. No untrusted data, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward, benign code.\n- **Scores:** All scores are 1 for confidence and zero for malware, obfuscated, securityRisk.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; no issues.\n- **Scores:** All zero or one as appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous; simple utility.\n- **Scores:** All scores at 1 for confidence, zero for malware, obfuscated, securityRisk.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Slightly higher securityRisk score of 0.1, which might be overly cautious given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The code outputs a static path from a trusted library; there's no risk involved in printing this path.\n- **Conclusion:** The securityRisk score could be slightly reduced to 0, as no real risk exists.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the simplicity and benign purpose, a risk score of 0 or very close to 0 is appropriate. The one report with 0.1 could be lowered.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward utility script that retrieves and prints a trusted, static file path from a well-known library. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores are reasonable, with the exception of the slightly elevated securityRisk in report 5, which should be adjusted to 0.\n- The overall code is benign and poses no security threat.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
