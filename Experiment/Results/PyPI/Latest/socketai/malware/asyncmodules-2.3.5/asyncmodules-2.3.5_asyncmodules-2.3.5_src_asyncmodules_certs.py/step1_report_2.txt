  "purpose": "Return the default CA certificate bundle path using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from certifi; executing 'print(where())' if run as main.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' outputs the CA bundle path to stdout.",
  "flows": "The code reads the CA bundle path from certifi and outputs it; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted library (certifi) to get the default CA bundle location. The only operation is printing this path if executed as a script. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data manipulation, and no suspicious logic. The code serves a straightforward utility purpose without any signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and secure, solely intended to output the default CA certificate bundle location. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
