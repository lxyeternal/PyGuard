{
  "purpose": "The code provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the requests library, primarily for use in packaging or environment configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package through the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it only prints the CA bundle path.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'where' from certifi to printing its output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function from a trusted library (certifi) and prints the path to the CA bundle. It does not process user input, execute untrusted code, or perform network operations. The purpose is configuration, not security-sensitive processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a simple configuration purpose. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
