  "purpose": "Return the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' library.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the certificate bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function retrieves a trusted CA bundle path; this data is printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and uses a well-known library without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' to obtain the default CA bundle path. It prints this path when executed directly. No user input, network communication, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code does not include any obfuscated logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors. The overall structure is simple and aligns with standard practices for such utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for printing the default CA bundle location from certifi. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
