{
  "purpose": "This module returns the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle path from the 'where' function imported from certifi.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code only outputs a file path and does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "The source (certifi.where) provides a static file path, which is printed when the script runs; no flow of untrusted data occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code simply prints a known, static path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a well-known, trusted package (certifi) and outputs its CA bundle path. It contains no user input handling, no data processing, and no network activity. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to output the default CA bundle path from certifi. It poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
