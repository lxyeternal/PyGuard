  "purpose": "This script returns the path to the default CA certificate bundle provided by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package and its invocation in the main block.",
  "sinks": "Printing the path to stdout; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function provides a trusted certificate bundle path; this path is printed when the script runs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known and trusted package (certifi) and uses its API to retrieve the path to the CA bundle. It includes a main block that prints this path. No untrusted data sources, external network calls, or potentially malicious code are present. The purpose appears to be utility, facilitating CA bundle retrieval. There are no signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, legitimate, and has no indicators of malicious intent. It functions solely to output the trusted CA bundle path from certifi. No security issues or malicious behaviors are evident.",
