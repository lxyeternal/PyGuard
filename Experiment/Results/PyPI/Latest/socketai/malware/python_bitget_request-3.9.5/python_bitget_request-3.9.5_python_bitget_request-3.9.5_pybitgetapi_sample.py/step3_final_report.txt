  "purpose": "A simple addition function that sums two inputs.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'a' and 'b' as input data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; function returns the sum directly.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow directly to the return statement without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward addition function with no external dependencies, no input/output beyond parameters, and no suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence scores, and assign zero malware and security risk scores. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior justify these assessments. No anomalies or obfuscation are present, and the code does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and free of security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
