{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'python-bitget-request' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file to provide a long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads a file (README.md) during package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() to read a file directly during setup without validation; however, this is a common pattern in setup scripts and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for packaging. It specifies package metadata such as name, version, packages, description, URL, author info, and classifiers. It reads 'README.md' content for long_description. No external data sources or untrusted input handling are present. The code performs standard package setup tasks with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs package configuration and file reading during installation.",
