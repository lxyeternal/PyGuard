  "anomalies": "Uses open() without a context manager; no exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script utilizing setuptools. It reads a local README file directly, which is common practice, though not ideal. There are no signs of malicious code, network activity, obfuscation, or handling of untrusted data. The minor concern about file handling does not constitute a security risk. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk scores. The confidence in these assessments is high, given the straightforward nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The minor file reading pattern does not pose a security risk. All reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
