{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools, including a custom install command that loads and executes code from a ZIP archive during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'README.md' for long_description; loads 'my.zip' file via zipimport; imports modules dynamically using importlib.util; executes 'hello()' function from the loaded module.",
  "sinks": "The dynamically imported module's 'hello()' function could potentially contain malicious code. The code itself executes code from 'my.zip' without validation or verification.",
  "flows": "The code reads 'my.zip' (source) during installation, imports a module from it, and executes its 'hello()' function (sink), which could be malicious if 'my.zip' is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes executing code from a ZIP archive during installation without any verification or signature check; no security checks on the imported module; dynamic execution from an external archive is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code reads external files ('README.md' and 'my.zip') during setup. The 'test()' function dynamically loads and executes code from 'my.zip', calling its 'hello()' function. This behavior is inherently risky because 'my.zip' could contain malicious code. The setup process does not verify the integrity or authenticity of 'my.zip' before executing its code. This pattern is suspicious, especially if 'my.zip' is not controlled or verified. The overall structure is standard for setup scripts, but the dynamic code execution from an external archive during installation is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior potential by executing code from an external ZIP archive during package installation without verification. This could allow malicious code to run automatically on install, representing a serious security risk.",
