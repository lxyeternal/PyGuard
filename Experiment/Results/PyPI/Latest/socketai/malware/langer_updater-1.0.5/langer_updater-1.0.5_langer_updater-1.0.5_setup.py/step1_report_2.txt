{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools, defines a custom installation step that loads and executes code from a zip archive during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; dynamically loads a module from 'my.zip' using zipimport during installation.",
  "sinks": "The zipimported module 'my' is executed with 'hello()' function call, which could be an entry point for malicious code if 'my.zip' contains harmful code.",
  "flows": "The code reads 'my.zip' from the filesystem, imports and executes 'hello()' from it during the install process, potentially executing untrusted code at install time.",
  "anomalies": "Executing code from an external zip archive ('my.zip') during installation is unusual and potentially dangerous; no validation of 'my.zip' contents or security checks are performed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures but introduces a risk by executing arbitrary code from 'my.zip' during installation. This can be exploited to run malicious code if 'my.zip' is maliciously crafted. There are no safeguards, validation, or checks against tampering. The rest of the setup appears typical. The dynamic execution during install is the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary risk is executing code from an external zip archive during installation without validation, which could be malicious. This behavior should be reviewed and secured to prevent potential supply chain attacks.",
