{
  "purpose": "The code loads 'my.zip' during setup using zipimport, creates a module, and executes its 'hello()' function without validation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'my.zip' via zipimport and executing 'hello()' from the imported module.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'module.hello()' which runs code from 'my.zip' during installation.",
  "flows": "zipimport.zipimporter loads 'my.zip' -> creates module spec -> loads module -> executes 'hello()' -> potentially malicious code runs.",
  "anomalies": "Code executes external ZIP archive during setup without any signature verification or sandboxing, which is highly unusual and risky.",
  "analysis": "The script loads 'my.zip' dynamically during installation and executes its 'hello()' function without validation, creating a potential vector for malicious code execution. This pattern introduces a significant supply chain security risk, as untrusted code could be run automatically. The scores assigned in reports (malware around 0.75, security risk above 0.8) are justified given the behavior. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The main concern is executing unverified external code during setup, which can be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern presents a high security risk due to executing external code during installation without validation, making it susceptible to supply chain attacks. The behavior warrants a high malware and security risk score, and it should be revised to include validation or sandboxing before deployment.",
