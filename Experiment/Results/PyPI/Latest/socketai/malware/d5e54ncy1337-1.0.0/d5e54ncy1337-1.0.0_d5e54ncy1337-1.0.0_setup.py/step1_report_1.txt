{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that customizes the installation process to include data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "A GET request is sent to an external URL with system information as parameters, which can leak sensitive data.",
  "flows": "The data collected from socket, os, and getpass modules flows directly into an HTTP GET request to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during installation without user consent, and the URL appears suspicious. No other malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the setuptools 'install' command to include a request that sends hostname, current directory, and username to an external URL during package installation. This behavior is unusual for a legitimate setup script and indicates potential data theft. The URL used is suspicious and likely controlled by an attacker. There are no signs of obfuscation or other malicious payloads. The code’s purpose appears malicious, aimed at capturing environment info covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior intended to exfiltrate system data during package installation, representing a security risk. It is highly suspicious and should not be used in production.",
