  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to include system information reporting to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during the custom install process.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends collected data to an external URL, which could be malicious or tracking in nature.",
  "flows": "System information (hostname, cwd, username) is collected during install, then sent via HTTP GET request to the specified external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code reports system info to an external domain without any apparent legitimate purpose; the URL used appears suspicious and similar to a known malicious or testing setup. The request is embedded directly within a custom install class, which is unusual for benign setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation class that, upon execution, gathers hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking. The URL used is not a standard package repository or known service but appears malicious or used for command-and-control. The code does not perform any actual package setup logic before or after this request. No other malicious activity is evident; the primary concern is the unauthorized data transmission during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code includes a suspicious external data transmission during package installation, indicating potential malicious intent or privacy violation. The data exfiltration aspect makes this highly risky for supply chain security.",
