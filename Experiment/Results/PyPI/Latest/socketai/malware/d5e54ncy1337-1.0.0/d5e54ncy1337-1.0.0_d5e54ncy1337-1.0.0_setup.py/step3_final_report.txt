{
  "purpose": "The code modifies setup.py to include a custom install command that, during installation, collects system information (hostname, current directory, username) and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL, indicating malicious data theft during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external URL",
  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> requests.get() with parameters",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration during setup without user consent, suspicious URL, no obfuscation, embedded directly in setup.py",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert data exfiltration by sending system info to an external server during package installation. The URL is suspicious, indicating potential malicious activity. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack tactics, and scores reflect high malicious intent. The malicious activity is clear and unambiguous, with no other payloads or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration embedded in setup.py, representing a serious supply chain security threat. The scores should reflect high malicious intent and risk, with malware and security risk scores set to 1, and obfuscation score at 0.",
