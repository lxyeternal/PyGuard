{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation process that collects system information during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during the custom install process.",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected system information via an HTTP GET request to an external domain, which could be used for data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "flows": "During installation, system information (hostname, cwd, username) is gathered and sent to an external server through a GET request.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system information to an external domain during package installation. The URL appears obfuscated and suspicious. The code overrides the default install command, which is uncommon and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard setup.py behavior by defining a CustomInstall class that extends the install command. Within the run method, it calls the base run method, then gathers system data: hostname, current working directory, and username. Subsequently, it makes an HTTP GET request to an external, obfuscated URL with the collected data as parameters. This behavior suggests data exfiltration or user tracking, which is suspicious in a package installation context. No other malicious actions or code obfuscation are present; the main concern is the external communication during installation, which can be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes malicious behavior by transmitting system information to an external server during package installation, indicating potential data collection or tracking without user consent. The external URL is suspicious, and the override of the installation process is unconventional and potentially harmful.",
