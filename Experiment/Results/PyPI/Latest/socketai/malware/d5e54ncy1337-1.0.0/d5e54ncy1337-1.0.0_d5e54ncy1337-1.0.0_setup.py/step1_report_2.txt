{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process that includes a custom installation step which reports system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() - gathering system hostname, current directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() - sending data to an external URL.",
  "flows": "System information collected at installation (hostname, cwd, username) is sent via HTTP GET request to an external server during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of code that transmits system details to a remote server during package installation; hardcoded external URL; no user consent or transparency; the URL appears suspicious and possibly malicious. The code is embedded in setup.py, which is commonly used during package installation, making this potentially covert data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command in setup.py that, upon installation, gathers system hostname, current working directory, and username. Immediately after, it sends these details via an HTTP GET request to a specified external URL. This behavior occurs transparently during package installation, which is suspicious and may be used for tracking, reconnaissance, or malicious purposes. The URL appears suspicious and could be controlled by an attacker or malicious actor. The code does not provide any user notification or consent, and it leverages common modules in an unusual way for data exfiltration. No other malicious code or backdoors are evident beyond this data collection and transmission. The overall intent aligns with malicious data harvesting without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it secretly collects system information and transmits it to an external server during package installation, representing a supply chain attack or data exfiltration. This code should be considered malicious and potentially harmful.",
