  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it to a remote server during package installation.",

  "flows": "Collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via HTTP GET request to a remote server during installation",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration during setup installation; use of hardcoded URL for data transmission; no user consent or notification; no validation or sanitization of data",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that extends the setuptools install command. During installation, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a remote URL. This behavior is suspicious as it exfiltrates potentially sensitive system information without user knowledge or consent, which could be malicious or part of a supply chain attack. The URL used appears to be a Burp Collaborator or similar testing server, indicating possible malicious intent or testing/debugging code that should not be in a production package.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation without user consent. It is likely malicious and should be considered dangerous, especially in the context of supply chain security. This code is intended to spy or gather system info surreptitiously.",
