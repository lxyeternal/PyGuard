{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to monitor Windows system and browser data, package it into ZIP files, and transmit it via sender objects, potentially for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Data is read from browser profiles, system info, processes, and specific applications (Discord, Telegram, Steam, Wallets). It also reads environment variables and configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Data is compressed into ZIP files, previewed, and sent through sender objects' run methods; network transmission occurs with SSL verification disabled.",
  "flows": "Sources (sensitive data collection modules) feed into packaging functions, which then transmit data via sender objects, with SSL bypass potentially facilitating covert exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Disabling SSL verification (`ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context`), extensive data collection from sensitive sources, use of modules named 'Multistealer', no obfuscation, and complex module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive user data from browsers and system modules, packages it, and transmits it over network connections with SSL verification disabled, which is suspicious. The structure and modules suggest spyware or stealer malware. The SSL bypass and data exfiltration focus are key indicators. No obfuscation or destructive payloads are present, but the overall pattern aligns with malicious surveillance tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with spyware or data-stealing malware, primarily due to extensive sensitive data collection, insecure SSL handling, and data exfiltration mechanisms. While no explicit malicious payloads are visible, its design indicates high malicious potential.",
