  "purpose": "Initialize and start platform-specific system monitoring and input monitoring threads.",
  "sources": "platform.system() to determine OS, instantiation of MacMonitor, InputMonitor, and WindowsMonitor objects.",
  "sinks": "Thread start methods executing monitoring functions, which could potentially collect system data.",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> conditional checks -> instantiation of platform-specific monitor objects -> threads started to run monitoring functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code, no unusual or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system, then starts threads for input monitoring and platform-specific system monitoring. The classes imported appear to be dedicated monitoring tools, likely intended for legitimate system health or activity tracking. The code structure is straightforward, with no hidden code, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or unauthorized data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. It appears to be a typical system monitoring setup, assuming the imported modules are legitimate and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cross-platform system and input monitoring, with no evident malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain compromise indicators.",
