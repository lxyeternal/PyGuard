  "purpose": "Initialize platform-specific system monitoring and input monitoring threads based on the operating system.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call to determine OS; instantiation of InputMonitor, MacMonitoring, and WindowsMonitoring classes.",
  "sinks": "Start methods of InputMonitor, MacMonitor, and WindowsMonitor classes, which may perform system monitoring tasks.",
  "flows": "platform.system() determines OS -> Threads invoke start_monitoring and run methods of monitoring classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. Imports and threading usage are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system (macOS or Windows) and starts corresponding monitoring threads. No suspicious logic, data leaks, or malicious behavior is evident. The imports and threading are typical for monitoring applications. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious data transmission are present. The code appears to be a legitimate monitoring setup with platform-specific components.",
  "conclusion": "The code sets up platform-dependent monitoring threads in a typical manner without any suspicious or malicious intent. It appears to be part of a monitoring or logging application, with no indicators of malware or malicious behavior.",
