  "purpose": "Initialize and start system monitoring based on the current operating system, including input monitoring and platform-specific system monitoring.",
  "sources": "platform.system() to determine OS; InputMonitor().start_monitoring to start input monitoring; platform-specific monitor classes (MacMonitoring, WindowsMonitoring) to perform system monitoring.",
  "sinks": "Starting monitoring threads that run potentially system-level monitoring functions.",
  "flows": "platform.system() determines platform -> threads start input and system monitors based on platform -> potentially continuous monitoring activities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. Usage of threading for monitoring tasks is standard; no apparent malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system and initiates input and system monitoring threads accordingly. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious backdoors are evident. The code relies on legitimate monitoring classes. It properly handles platform-specific imports and starts threads for monitoring tasks. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The overall structure appears to be standard system monitoring setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs platform-dependent initialization of monitoring routines in a typical manner, with no indicators of malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a straightforward implementation of system monitoring starting procedures.",
