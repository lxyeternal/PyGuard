  "purpose": "Define an abstract template for sending data, including SSL handling and data management functions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, class constructor, abstract methods, static method for SSL context modification.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, no network or system calls in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Not fully implemented; flow would involve calling __get_sender_data and __send_archive, but not shown here.",
  "anomalies": "Disabling SSL certificate verification via _create_unverified_https() can be risky, but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with methods to handle data sending, including disabling SSL verification which could be exploited if misused, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. There are no apparent suspicious data flows, no network or file operations in this fragment, and no hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a template for a data sender module with SSL handling. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware as-is. The SSL disabling method is potentially risky but is a common practice in controlled testing environments. Overall, no malicious intent is evident in this fragment.",
