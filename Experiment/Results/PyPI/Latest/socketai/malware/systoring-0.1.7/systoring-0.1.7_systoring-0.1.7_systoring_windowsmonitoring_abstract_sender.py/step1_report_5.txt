  "purpose": "Define an abstract template class for sending data, likely for monitoring or reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "Config object from 'systoring.windowsmonitoring.helpers.config', which may contain sensitive configuration data.",
  "sinks": "The method '_create_unverified_https' disables SSL verification, which could be misused to accept insecure certificates; potential data transmission over HTTPS.",
  "flows": "Data to be sent (from __get_sender_data) is likely processed and transmitted via __send_archive, with SSL verification disabled to bypass security.",
  "anomalies": "Disabling SSL verification via '_create_unverified_https' is a security risk; no input validation or sanitization is evident. Use of abstract methods indicates this class is meant to be extended, but no implementation details are provided.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with methods for data retrieval and sending, including a method to disable SSL verification, which is a security concern. The class imports external configurations and encoders, and the only potentially suspicious feature is the SSL context override, which can allow man-in-the-middle attacks if misused. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present. The class appears to be a base for a data transmission module, potentially used for monitoring or reporting. No actual malicious behavior is visible, but the SSL override can be exploited if not used carefully.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself does not contain malware or malicious intent, but the method to disable SSL verification poses a security risk if misused. It is a base class meant for data sending, with no immediate malicious behavior detected. Care should be taken when implementing '_create_unverified_https' to avoid insecure data transmission.",
