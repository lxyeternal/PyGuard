{
  "purpose": "This code defines an __all__ variable for module exports, indicating that only AbstractSender should be publicly accessible.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.sender import AbstractSender)",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data output or network communication present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only imports and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; the code is straightforward and does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports AbstractSender from a local module, then explicitly specifies that only AbstractSender is exported when the module is imported elsewhere. There are no dynamic features, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The structure is typical for a Python module aiming to control its public API.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple module interface declaration without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
