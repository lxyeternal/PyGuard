  "purpose": "This code defines a module that imports the AbstractSender class from a local sender module and exposes it via __all__ for public API control.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .sender module",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "Import of AbstractSender from sender module; no data flow beyond import",
  "anomalies": "None; minimal, straightforward code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module interface declaration with an import and an __all__ definition. No data flows, network activity, or external interactions are present. The code is standard, benign, and free of security issues or malicious behavior. All reports confirm its benign nature, assigning high confidence and zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions strongly suggest it is safe and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python module interface with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
