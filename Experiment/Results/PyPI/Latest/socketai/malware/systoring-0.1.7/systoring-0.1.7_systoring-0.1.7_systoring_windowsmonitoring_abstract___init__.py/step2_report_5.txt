  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward import and export declaration. All reports correctly identify that there are no data flows, sinks, or sources beyond the import statement.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present in any of the reports.\n   - The code is minimal, standard practice, and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a risk of 0, and the code is purely an import/export declaration with no suspicious activity, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security concerns.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - No malicious behavior is observed or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on observable code patterns.\n   - No unwarranted claims about vulnerabilities are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's actual content.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThis code snippet is a standard module interface declaration. It imports a class and defines what to export, with no data processing, network activity, or suspicious constructs. The scores assigned are appropriate, and there are no reasons to adjust them.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and secure.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The current scores accurately reflect the code's nature.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nMaintain the current scoring as is; no further action needed.",
