{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that re-exports the AbstractSender class from a local sender module, likely part of a larger package's public API.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing AbstractSender from a relative module, and the __all__ list defining exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs are visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident in this minimal code snippet; it only sets up exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious patterns, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a local module and specifies what symbols to export. There are no inputs, no data processing, no network activity, and no insecure operations. The structure indicates standard Python module practice. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module export statement with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions solely to expose the AbstractSender class for external use.",
