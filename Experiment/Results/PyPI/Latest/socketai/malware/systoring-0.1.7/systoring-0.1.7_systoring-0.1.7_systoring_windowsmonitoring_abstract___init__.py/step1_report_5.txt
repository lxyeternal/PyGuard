  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; no input or output handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with straightforward import and export; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class 'AbstractSender' from a local module and exposes it via '__all__'. There are no data processing, user input handling, or external communications. The code is minimal and appears to be part of a package's interface definition. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module interface declaration with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It appears safe and standard for a Python package.",
