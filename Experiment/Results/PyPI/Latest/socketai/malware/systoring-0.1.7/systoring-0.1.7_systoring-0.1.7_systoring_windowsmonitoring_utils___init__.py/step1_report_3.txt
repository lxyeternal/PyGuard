{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports specific classes from local submodules and defines an export list for these classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission observed",
  "flows": "Import statements to module export list, no data flow involving external inputs or untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple import statements from relative modules and defines an __all__ list. It does not process user input, access environment variables, or perform any network or file operations. The structure and syntax are straightforward and typical for a Python module meant to organize and expose classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign piece of code primarily used for organizing class imports.",
