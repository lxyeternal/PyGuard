{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a simple module that imports specific classes from local modules and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb)",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data processing, network, or file operations",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports classes and exports them",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from local modules, likely part of a larger package, and exposes these classes for external use via __all__. There are no inputs, network operations, or data handling present. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an initializer for module exports with no malicious intent or security risks.",
