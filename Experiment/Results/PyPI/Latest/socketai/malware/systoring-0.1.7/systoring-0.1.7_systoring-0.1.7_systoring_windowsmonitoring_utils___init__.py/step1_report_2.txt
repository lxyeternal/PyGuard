{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes from relative modules and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports classes and defines an export list without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious instructions are present",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports classes from sibling modules and declares an __all__ list for module exports. It does not process input, handle data, or execute any logic that could be malicious. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module file, intended for namespace management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a simple module aggregator without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
