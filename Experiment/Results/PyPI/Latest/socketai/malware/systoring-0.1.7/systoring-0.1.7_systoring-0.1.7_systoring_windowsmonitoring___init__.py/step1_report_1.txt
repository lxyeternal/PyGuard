{
  "purpose": "Module exports importing classes and constants for monitoring and utilities",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or system modifications",
  "flows": "Imports serve as references to external classes/constants but do not process untrusted data here",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; simple module export statements",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes and constants from relative modules and defines __all__ for exports. No data processing, user input handling, or network activity occurs in this fragment. No suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent. The code appears to be part of a package's __init__.py or module entry point, solely setting up exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import/export pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
