{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an import and export module that consolidates various components and enums for use elsewhere in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs; straightforward import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enums from local modules and defines __all__ for export. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modification. No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns are evident. Usage of relative imports suggests modular design, but nothing indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module aggregator with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It simply re-exports components for use in other parts of the project.",
