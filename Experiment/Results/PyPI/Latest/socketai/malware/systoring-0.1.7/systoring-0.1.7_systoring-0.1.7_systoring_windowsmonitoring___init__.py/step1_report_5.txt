{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that re-exports specific classes and enums from internal modules, likely for use in a larger package or application.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and specific classes or enums from within the package: 'windowsmonitoring', 'enums', and 'utils'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks or places where untrusted data is processed or could cause harm within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident in this code snippet; it only imports and defines what to export.",
  "anomalies": "The code structure is straightforward with standard import and export statements. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports modules and specific classes/enums, then declares an __all__ list for exports. There are no operations, data processing, or external interactions. This is a typical __init__.py or module export pattern. No signs of obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions as a simple re-export module, which is common in Python packages.",
