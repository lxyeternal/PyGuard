  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward module export pattern, importing classes/constants and defining `__all__`. No data flows, sinks, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign and typical for a package's `__init__.py`. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing no external data flows or suspicious patterns. Slightly lower confidence but still high.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (minimal).  \n- **Assessment:** Also consistent; no malicious activity, just module setup.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—imports and exports with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues; benign code.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard module re-export pattern, no anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same conclusion—no data flows, no suspicious constructs.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple module export pattern, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The risk scores are minimal or zero, reflecting no security concerns.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- The code snippet is a standard `__init__.py` or module export file, common in Python packages.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- No changes needed; the assessments are appropriate.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's purpose and the detailed analysis provided.",
