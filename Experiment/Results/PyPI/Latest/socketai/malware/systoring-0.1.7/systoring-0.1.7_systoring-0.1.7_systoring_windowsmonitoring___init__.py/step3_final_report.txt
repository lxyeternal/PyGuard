  "purpose": "Module exports for monitoring and utility classes/constants in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ definition, no data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports specific classes and constants from internal modules and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no data processing, network activity, or system modifications. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or module setup. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module export pattern with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
