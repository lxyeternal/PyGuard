  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code only performs module imports and sets `__all__`.\n- No data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Confidence is high (1), and malware/obfuscated scores are zero.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes straightforward imports and no suspicious activity.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent.\n- No malware or obfuscation.\n- Security risk is minimal (0.1), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: imports and exports only, no suspicious activity.\n- Confidence is perfect (1), and all scores are zero.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, standard import/export pattern with no anomalies.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Confidence is 1; all scores zero.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above: module re-export pattern, no suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence is 1, all scores zero.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple module export pattern.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code content.\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- The code snippet is benign, straightforward, and typical for Python package initialization.\n- The scores across all reports are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the reports accurately reflect its benign nature.",
