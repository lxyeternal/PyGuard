  "purpose": "This code module appears to import classes and constants from internal modules and then exports them for external use, likely as part of a larger monitoring or utility package.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external or untrusted sources are observable in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are evident",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and defines an export list. It imports specific classes and constants from internal modules without any external input or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The structure is typical for Python packages setting up public API exports.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears standard for module import/export configuration without any suspicious behavior.",
