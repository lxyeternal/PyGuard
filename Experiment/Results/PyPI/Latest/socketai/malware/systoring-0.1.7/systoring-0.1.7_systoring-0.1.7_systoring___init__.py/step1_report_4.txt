  "purpose": "Import platform-specific monitoring classes and functions for system monitoring setup",
  "sources": "platform.system() call to determine OS; imports from local modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no output or external data operations",
  "flows": "platform.system() influences conditional import of WindowsMonitoring; imports of functions and classes",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import based on platform is standard; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system to conditionally import Windows-specific monitoring class. It imports modules for macOS and other system monitoring functions, and defines an exported API list. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The import statements and platform check are typical for cross-platform modules. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, benign module for system monitoring setup, with proper platform detection and standard imports. No malicious or security-threatening behavior identified.",
