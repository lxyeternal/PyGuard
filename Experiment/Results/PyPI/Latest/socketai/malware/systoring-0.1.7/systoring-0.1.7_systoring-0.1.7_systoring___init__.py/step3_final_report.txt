  "purpose": "Platform detection and conditional import of monitoring modules based on OS.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call for OS detection.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> conditional import of WindowsMonitoring -> import of other modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward platform check and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard platform check using platform.system().lower(), conditionally imports WindowsMonitoring if on Windows, and always imports MacMonitoring, initialize_system_monitoring, and InputMonitor. The code is simple, with no obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior. No data leaks, network activity, or code injection present. The import pattern is typical for cross-platform modules. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard platform detection and module imports, and shows no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk and malware scores are appropriately zero, with a very low security risk. The code is safe for use in a supply chain context, assuming the imported modules are trustworthy.",
