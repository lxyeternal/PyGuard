{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'systoring', including metadata, dependencies, and packaging details.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; no other data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no execution of external or untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README.md file into the long_description variable, then into setup parameters. No other data flows or external data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The package description mentions 'For Educational Purposes ONLY!!!' but this is informational. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file for packaging a Python project using setuptools. It reads a README file for long description and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and optional requirements for different OS. There are no dynamic code executions, network connections, or embedded secrets. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors. All dependencies are well-known packages. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup configuration script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
