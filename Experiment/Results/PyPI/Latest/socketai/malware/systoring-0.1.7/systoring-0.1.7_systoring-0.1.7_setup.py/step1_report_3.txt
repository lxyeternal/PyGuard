  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'systoring' intended for monitoring system events, aimed at educational use.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; no other input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no data transmission or processing based on external input.",
  "flows": "N/A – no untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard setup procedures and well-known dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup using setuptools, reading a README file and defining dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious imports or behaviors. The dependencies listed are common for system monitoring tools, and no malicious patterns are observed. The code appears typical for a Python package distribution script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It does not perform any network operations, data collection, or obscure actions. The package appears to be for legitimate system monitoring purposes.",
