  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'systoring', providing package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description, and includes package dependencies specified in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the script primarily manages package configuration and dependencies without executing untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script does not process untrusted input or data flows that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic detected. The script follows standard setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for description and specifies package dependencies and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, external commands, or handling of untrusted input present. The dependencies listed are typical for a monitoring library, with no indications of malicious intent. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code observed. The script appears safe and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is intended for package configuration and dependency management. No signs of malware or security issues detected.",
