  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- No reports identify any malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior.\n- All dependencies are common and relevant for system monitoring tools.\n- No external or untrusted data is processed at runtime.\n- The script reads a README.md for description, which is standard practice.\n- No network operations, code execution, or data leaks are evident.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The package name \"systoring\" and description mention system monitoring and educational purposes.\n- The only potential concern is the package description: \"For Educational Purposes ONLY!!!\" — this is informational and does not imply malicious intent.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The reports' confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware score: all reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated score: all 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- Security risk: all 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical, benign setup script.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent, malware, or security risks.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:**\nThe reports are thorough and consistent. Given the evidence, the package appears safe and legitimate, intended solely for distribution of a system monitoring library.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard setup.py script.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.\n- Scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**This concludes the review.**",
