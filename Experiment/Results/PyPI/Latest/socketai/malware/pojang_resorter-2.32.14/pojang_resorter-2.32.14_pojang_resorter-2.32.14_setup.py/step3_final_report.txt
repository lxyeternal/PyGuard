  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration for 'pojang_resorter'.",
  "sources": "Dependencies listed in 'install_requires' and the 'main' entry point in 'entry_points'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'pojang-resorter' script via console, installation of dependencies.",
  "flows": "The setup process installs dependencies and registers the console script; no untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with standard dependencies used for automation, image processing, network requests, and Windows-specific tasks. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network communication occurs within this script. Dependencies are common and do not indicate malicious intent. The entry point is a straightforward console script. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious code. The dependency list and configuration are typical for a project of this nature. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately zero, with a very low risk score reflecting potential misuse of dependencies but no actual malicious activity detected.",
