  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for 'pojang_resorter' including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static code defining dependencies, package metadata, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'pojang_resorter.main:main' entry point; dependencies may perform various actions.",
  "flows": "Setup configuration data flow; potential runtime flow depends on 'main' function execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard libraries and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses setuptools to configure a Python package with specified dependencies and entry points. Dependencies include common libraries for image processing, automation, network requests, Discord integration, and Windows-specific functionality. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident. The presence of 'discord.py' and 'pyautogui' could enable automation or communication features, but on their own, they are not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard package configuration script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based solely on this script.",
