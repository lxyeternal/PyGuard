  "conclusion": "The script is straightforward but performs covert screen capture and data exfiltration to an external server, indicating high malicious potential. The hardcoded webhook and silent operation are suspicious. The scores in the reports are appropriate; a malware score of approximately 0.8-0.9 and a security risk around 0.85 accurately reflect the threat level. The code itself is not obfuscated but exhibits behaviors characteristic of spyware or malicious surveillance tools."
