  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `main` from a local module (`from .main import main`)\n- Defines static metadata: `__version__` and `__author__`\n- Contains a brief docstring describing the package purpose\n- No dynamic code, user input, data processing, network activity, or obfuscation\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign and serves as a package initializer.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- None identified. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Scores:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent.\n- Since the code does not perform any dynamic operations, network communication, or data handling, the risk scores should remain at zero.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is typical for a package's `__init__.py` or main module, serving as a simple entry point.\n- The import of a local `main` function suggests that actual application logic resides elsewhere, not in this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nBased on the detailed review, **all scores are appropriate**. The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern signals.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **malware:** 0\n- **obfuscated:** 0\n- **risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's actual content.",
