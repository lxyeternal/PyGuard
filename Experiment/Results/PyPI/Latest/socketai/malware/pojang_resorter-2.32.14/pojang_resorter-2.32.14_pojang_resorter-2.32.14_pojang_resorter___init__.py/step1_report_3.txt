  "sources": "Import statement for '.main', version string, author string",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets metadata and imports a module",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a local module, and setting package metadata. No input reading, data processing, or network operations present. The structure appears typical for a package's __init__.py file, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward package initialization code with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
