  "purpose": "Package initialization for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, providing metadata and importing the main function.",
  "sources": "Static metadata variables (__version__, __author__), import statement from local module (.main import main)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no data flow involving external inputs",
  "flows": "Import statement and static variable assignments; no dynamic data flow or untrusted data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static package initializer with a standard import and metadata. No dynamic behavior, input handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these scores. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident, and the code aligns with typical package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
