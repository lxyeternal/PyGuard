  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is minimal, straightforward, and only performs package initialization tasks: importing a local module (`main`) and setting static metadata variables (`__version__`, `__author__`).\n   - There are no indications of dynamic code execution, network activity, data processing, or any form of input/output handling that could be exploited.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or anomalies are detected.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Code and Reports:**\n   - The code snippet is typical for a Python package's `__init__.py` or similar setup file.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and does not contain any security risks or malicious intent.\n   - The consistent confidence score of 1.0 across all reports is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, consistent with the clear, unobfuscated code.\n   - **Risk Score:** Given the lack of any vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious activity, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The only potential concern might be the import of `main`, but since it is a local module and there's no evidence of malicious code within the provided snippet, this is not a risk.\n   - The reports do not mention any external dependencies or network activity, which could be relevant in other contexts but are not present here.\n\n5. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard package initialization script.\n   - The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n   - No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n**Based on the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments.**  \n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is benign and poses no security risks.",
