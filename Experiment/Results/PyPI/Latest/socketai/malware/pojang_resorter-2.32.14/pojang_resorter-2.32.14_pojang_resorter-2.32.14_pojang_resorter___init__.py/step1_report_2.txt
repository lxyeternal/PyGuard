{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, mainly importing the main function and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement for .main, module-level variables __version__ and __author__",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "Import statement does not involve data flow; package metadata is static",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal package initialization script. It imports a main function from a local module and defines static metadata variables. There are no user inputs, data reads, or external data sources. The code does not perform any dynamic execution, network operations, or data processing that could pose security risks. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward package setup file with no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple package initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It only imports a local function and defines static metadata, posing no threat.",
