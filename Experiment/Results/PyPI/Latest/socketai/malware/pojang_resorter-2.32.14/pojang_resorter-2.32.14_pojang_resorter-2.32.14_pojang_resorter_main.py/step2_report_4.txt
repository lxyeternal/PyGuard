  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The script is a CLI wrapper that maps user commands to specific Python scripts.\n- It checks for script existence before executing via subprocess.\n- Commands are limited to a predefined set, reducing injection risk.\n- The external scripts' safety depends on their integrity; the main code itself is straightforward and safe.\n- No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Targets:** Correctly notes that executing external scripts could be malicious if those scripts are compromised.\n- **Flows & anomalies:** No issues.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; the main code is safe, external scripts are the risk vector.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.  \n  **Verdict:** Reasonable. The low risk reflects reliance on external scripts.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- Correctly identifies the subprocess execution as a potential risk if scripts are malicious.\n- Scores are the same, reflecting the same conclusion.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Similar analysis, consistent with previous reports.\n- Slightly lower security risk score (0.1), which is reasonable given the controlled command set.\n- Malware score remains 0, as no malicious behavior is observed.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Same reasoning, consistent.\n- Slightly higher risk score (0.2), justified by the fact that external scripts are executed based on user commands.\n- Malware remains 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Similar analysis, with a note on potential exploitation if command map is altered.\n- Still, the command choices are limited and controlled.\n- Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **External scripts:** The primary attack surface; if those scripts are malicious, the overall system could be compromised, but the main code is not malicious.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code snippet.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, but generally low, reflecting reliance on external scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — due to external scripts being executed, which could be malicious if compromised, but the main code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are appropriate given the code's nature. No modifications needed. The main risk lies in the external scripts, not the main code itself.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0.2**  \n\nThis reflects a controlled, safe CLI wrapper, with external script integrity being the main concern.",
