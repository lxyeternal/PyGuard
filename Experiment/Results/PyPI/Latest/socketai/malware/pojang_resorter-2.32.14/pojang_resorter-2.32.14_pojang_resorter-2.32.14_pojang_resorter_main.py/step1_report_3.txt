  "purpose": "A CLI tool that executes predefined Python scripts based on user commands, primarily for automation tasks like screenshots and bot server initialization.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse; constructs script paths relative to the current file location.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.run to execute other Python scripts based on the command; logs errors to a file.",
  "flows": "User inputs command -> command is mapped to a script name -> script path is constructed -> subprocess.run executes the script.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code. Use of subprocess to run scripts dynamically based on user input could be risky if the script names or commands are manipulated, but currently they are fixed and mapped. No network activity or data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles command-line input and executes other scripts accordingly, with error logging. The script map limits execution to known scripts, reducing risk. No user input is directly executed as code; commands are validated against a predefined set. The subprocess call is standard for executing scripts but could be risky if the command map is altered or if the scripts themselves are malicious, but within this context, it appears controlled. No malware signatures or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or backdoors are detected. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a command dispatcher executing specific scripts based on user input, with proper logging and input validation. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
