  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured CLI wrapper that safely executes predefined external scripts. The primary risk lies in the external scripts' trustworthiness, not the code itself. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) reflecting external dependency considerations."
