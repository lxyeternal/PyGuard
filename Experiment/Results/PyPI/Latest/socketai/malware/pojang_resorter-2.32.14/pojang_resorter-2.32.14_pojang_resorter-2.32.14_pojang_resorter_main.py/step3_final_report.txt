  "purpose": "A CLI tool that maps user commands to specific Python scripts and executes them via subprocess.",
  "sources": "User command input processed through argparse; command mapping dict; script existence check.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing external scripts based on user commands.",
  "flows": "User input -> argparse -> command_map lookup -> script path verification -> subprocess.run() to execute script.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or secrets; controlled command choices; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward command dispatcher that limits commands to predefined options, checks for script existence, and executes scripts via subprocess. It logs errors but does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The main security concern is external scripts' integrity, which is outside this code's scope. No vulnerabilities, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code follows best practices for controlled execution and input validation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured CLI wrapper that safely executes predefined external scripts. The primary risk lies in the external scripts' trustworthiness, not the code itself. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) reflecting external dependency considerations.",
