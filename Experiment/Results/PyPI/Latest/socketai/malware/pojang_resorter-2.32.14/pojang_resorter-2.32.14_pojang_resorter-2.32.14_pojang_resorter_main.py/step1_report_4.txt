  "purpose": "A CLI tool for executing predefined scripts based on user commands, primarily for automation or management tasks.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line argument ('command'), script files located in the same directory as the main script.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run executing external Python scripts based on user commands.",
  "flows": "Command input → command_map lookup → script path resolution → subprocess.run execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run with dynamically determined script paths; no evident hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. Logging setup is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code reads user commands via argparse, maps commands to script filenames, and executes them using subprocess. It logs errors if scripts are missing or execution fails. No data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network activity are present. The subprocess execution could potentially run arbitrary scripts if the directory contains malicious scripts, but the code itself does not contain malicious behavior. No obfuscation or malware indicators are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward CLI dispatcher that runs specific scripts based on user input. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks itself but depends on the scripts it executes. No malware or obfuscation detected. The security concern mainly relates to trusting the scripts in the same directory. Overall, the code appears benign.",
