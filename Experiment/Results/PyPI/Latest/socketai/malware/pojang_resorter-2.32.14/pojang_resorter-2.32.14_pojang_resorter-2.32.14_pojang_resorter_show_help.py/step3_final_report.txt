  "purpose": "Display help information for the CLI tool 'Pojang Resorter' with predefined commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines a static argument parser with hardcoded choices.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only prints help messages.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only displays static help info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports argparse, defines a function to create and display a help message with specific command choices, and calls this function if run as main. It does not process user input beyond argument validation, nor does it perform any network or system actions. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's simple, transparent nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious intents are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help utility with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
