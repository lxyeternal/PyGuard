  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CLI help utility.\n- No untrusted data processing, no external data sinks, no network activity, and no command execution beyond displaying help.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.\n- The code only defines a function to show help and invokes it if run as main.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is simple and static; it doesn't process user input beyond argparse's validation.\n- The command choices are hardcoded and do not lead to any further actions.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- The **malware score** is correctly 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, matching the straightforward, clear code.\n- The **security risk score** is 0, given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The **confidence** is 1 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No issues detected; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code does not process or execute commands; it only displays help, which is safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign CLI help utility.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The analysis correctly reflects the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's behavior.\n\n**Final note:** No evidence suggests any malicious intent or security vulnerability in this code snippet.",
