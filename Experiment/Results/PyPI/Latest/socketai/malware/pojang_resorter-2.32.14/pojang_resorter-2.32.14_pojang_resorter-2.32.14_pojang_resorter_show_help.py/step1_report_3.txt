  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool for 'Pojang Resorter' with options for commands like 'screenshot', 'botserver', 'do-snapshot', and 'help'.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse from sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Uses argparse's internal mechanisms to process inputs; no direct output or network connections are present",
  "flows": "Input (command-line arguments) flows from sys.argv to argparse parser, which validates and displays help messages",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and limited to argument parsing and help display.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an argument parser with specific command choices and provides a help message. It does not process or execute the commands beyond showing help. There are no external data sources, no data leaks, or network activity. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The script appears to be a benign CLI utility setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI help display for a set of commands related to 'Pojang Resorter'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks present.",
