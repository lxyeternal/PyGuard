{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool for 'Pojang Resorter', allowing users to execute commands like screenshot, botserver, do-snapshot, or help.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from command-line arguments via argparse.",
  "sinks": "None of the input data is used in a way that could lead to data leakage or security vulnerabilities; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (source) is processed by argparse to determine the command to execute; the flow ends with printing help if the script is run directly.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and contains no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated sections.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes an ArgumentParser with a description and adds a 'command' argument with specific choices. It then prints help information if executed as the main module. No data is transmitted externally, and no sensitive operations are performed. There are no malicious behaviors such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The logic is simple and typical for CLI help functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI help script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply displays help information based on command-line input.",
