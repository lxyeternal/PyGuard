{
  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface (CLI) help message for a tool called 'Pojang Resorter'. It displays help information about available commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via the argparse.ArgumentParser, specifically the 'command' argument.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data or input is processed beyond displaying help messages; no data is sent or stored.",
  "flows": "Input (command-line argument) -> argparse parser -> display help message.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports argparse to handle command-line arguments, defines a function to show help information, and invokes this function if run as the main program. The command choices are static, and the code only displays help without executing commands or performing operations that could be malicious. There are no data leaks, environment variable misuse, or suspicious activities.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be a standard CLI help display without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI help utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply presents help information for predefined commands. No suspicious or malicious code detected.",
