{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL and executes it silently on the system.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current working directory, and the remote URL (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/zwerve.exe).",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file is executed via PowerShell, which can potentially run malicious code if the file is harmful.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a curl command to download a file from a remote URL, saves it locally, then executes the downloaded file using PowerShell's Start-Process cmdlet.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically downloads and executes a potentially unverified executable from a remote source without user consent or verification. No integrity checks or validation are performed on the downloaded file. The use of PowerShell to execute remote content can be indicative of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script uses subprocess to run PowerShell commands for downloading and executing a file. The download URL points to a raw file on GitHub, which could host malicious content. The process proceeds to run the downloaded executable without any validation or user confirmation, representing a high risk of executing malicious code. The code structure is straightforward, but its behavior aligns with typical dropper or downloader malware patterns, especially given the automatic execution of an unverified executable from an external source.",
  "conclusion": "This code is potentially malicious as it downloads and runs an executable from an untrusted source without validation. It resembles common downloader malware techniques, posing high security risks. It should not be used without further validation and safeguards.",
