{
  "purpose": "This script is used to set up and configure the packaging information for a Python project named 'pyvantq'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statement (`from setuptools import setup`) and the parameters supplied to the `setup()` function.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the `setup()` function parameters, which could be exploited if they include malicious or maliciously crafted data, but in this case, the parameters are static and controlled.",
  "flows": "Input sources are static data used in `setup()` parameters; there are no external inputs or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The author name 'skibidiohiosigma123' appears as a hardcoded string; no other anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, using setuptools to define package metadata. There are no dynamic or external data inputs, no code injection, no network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious code. The author name seems arbitrary but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
