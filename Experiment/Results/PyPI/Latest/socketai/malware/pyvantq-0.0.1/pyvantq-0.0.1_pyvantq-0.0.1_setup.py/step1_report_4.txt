{
  "purpose": "Setup script for Python package 'pyvantq' to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded package name, version, author, description, and package list in the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sources; no external network or file I/O operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration with no dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The author name 'skibidiohiosigma123' appears unusual but is not inherently malicious; description is 'None' which is unconventional but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward call to setuptools.setup with static package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code does not contain any runtime code execution, network activity, or credential handling. The only notable aspect is the unusual author name and empty description, which do not indicate malicious intent but could be considered non-standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The author and description are unconventional but not malicious. The package appears safe based on this script alone.",
