  "purpose": "To define package metadata and setup configuration for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static package metadata provided within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code solely executes setup configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A — static configuration with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Author name 'skibidiohiosigma123' appears unusual or potentially fabricated; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python module named 'pyvantq'. It uses setuptools to specify package name, version, author, description, and package list. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden payloads, or suspicious behaviors. The author name may be considered unusual but not malicious. No external data sources, network activity, or code execution beyond package configuration are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for packaging a Python module. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The author name appears unconventional but does not indicate malicious intent.",
