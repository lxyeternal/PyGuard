  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'pyvantq' Python module.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and packages list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not execute or pass untrusted data to dangerous functions.",
  "flows": "The setup() function uses static inputs; no data flow from external sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Author name 'skibidiohiosigma123' appears unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious data handling. The author name is unconventional but not suspicious. No external input handling, no network activity, or code injection present. The script is straightforward and typical for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
