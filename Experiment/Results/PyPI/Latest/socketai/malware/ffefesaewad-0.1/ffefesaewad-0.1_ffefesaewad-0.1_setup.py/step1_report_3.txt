  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package, specifying its name, version, and included packages.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package configuration data within the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data affects system behavior; the code solely defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the hardcoded package metadata into the setup() function, which is standard for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'ffefesaewad' appears random and possibly obfuscated, but this alone is not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, then calls setup() with basic metadata. There are no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated logic, or malicious behavior. The package name seems arbitrary, but this is common in placeholder or intentionally obscure package names and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with an unusual package name but no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate configuration file.",
