{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports modules and defines setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; no sinks for data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: import modules, define setup parameters, and execute setup.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'ffefesaewad' is unusual and potentially obfuscated, but no malicious or obfuscating code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard setup script with no dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The package name's randomness raises minor suspicion but does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, malicious functions, or obfuscation techniques are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated≈0.1, securityRisk≈0.1) are justified given the context. The code's benign nature is confirmed by all reports, and no anomalies are found beyond the package name.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with an unusual package name that does not suggest malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate; the minimal suspicion about the package name does not warrant higher risk or malware scores. Overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible.",
