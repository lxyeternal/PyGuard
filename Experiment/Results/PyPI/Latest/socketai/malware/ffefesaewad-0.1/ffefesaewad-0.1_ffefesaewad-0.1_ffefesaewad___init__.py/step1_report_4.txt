  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding followed by dynamic execution, which is commonly used to obfuscate malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code decodes a base64 string which translates to 'print(\"test\")', then immediately executes it via exec(). Although the decoded code is simple, the pattern of decoding and executing code dynamically is often employed to hide malicious behavior. This pattern warrants suspicion, especially if the decoded content were more complex or malicious. The current payload simply prints 'test', which is benign, but the structure could be used for malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic example of obfuscation through base64 encoding and dynamic execution. While the decoded content is harmless ('print(\"test\")'), the pattern itself is suspicious as it can conceal malicious code. The risk depends on what the encoded string contains; as-is, it's low, but the pattern should be regarded with caution.",
