  "sinks": "exec() function execution of the decoded string, which runs arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "base64.b64decode() decodes the string -> exec() executes the decoded code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on dynamically decoded data is suspicious; the code is obfuscated intentionally to hide behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the base64 module, decodes a base64 string to 'print(\"test\")', and then executes it with exec(). While in this case the decoded code simply prints 'test', the use of exec() on dynamically decoded data is a common pattern for hiding malicious code. This approach allows malicious code to be concealed and executed at runtime, which is a security risk. The actual decoded code is benign ('print(\"test\")'), but the pattern itself is suspicious and can be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation by decoding and executing base64-encoded data, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts. Although the current payload is harmless, the pattern is potentially dangerous and can be used to execute malicious code. The presence of exec() on decoded data warrants caution.",
