  "conclusion": "The code employs an obfuscation pattern (base64 + exec) that is commonly associated with malicious scripts, but the current payload is benign. Scores should reflect the pattern's inherent risk rather than the specific payload. Overall, the pattern should be flagged for ongoing monitoring, but the current code is not malicious."
