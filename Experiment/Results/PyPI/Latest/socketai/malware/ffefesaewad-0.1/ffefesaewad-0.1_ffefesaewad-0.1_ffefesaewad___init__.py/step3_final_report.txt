  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string which translates to 'print(\"test\")' and executes it using exec().",
  "sources": "The base64 string 'cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==' used as input data.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function that executes the decoded string.",
  "flows": "Decoding base64 -> decoding UTF-8 -> executing with exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding combined with exec() to run dynamically decoded code, which is a common obfuscation pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes a base64 string to 'print(\"test\")' and executes it. The pattern of decoding and executing arbitrary code is suspicious and often used to conceal malicious payloads. However, the current payload is benign. All reports correctly identify the pattern and assign high obfuscation scores. Malware scores are generally low, reflecting the benign payload, but some reports assign higher scores based on the obfuscation pattern. The scores are consistent with the pattern's potential risk. The pattern warrants caution and monitoring, but in this specific case, the payload is harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs an obfuscation pattern (base64 + exec) that is commonly associated with malicious scripts, but the current payload is benign. Scores should reflect the pattern's inherent risk rather than the specific payload. Overall, the pattern should be flagged for ongoing monitoring, but the current code is not malicious.",
