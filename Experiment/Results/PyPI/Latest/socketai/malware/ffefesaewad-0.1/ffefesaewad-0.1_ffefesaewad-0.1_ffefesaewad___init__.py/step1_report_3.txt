  "purpose": "The code appears to decode a base64-encoded string and execute the resulting code.",
  "sources": "base64.b64decode('cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==') reads the embedded base64 string.",
  "sinks": "exec() executes the decoded string, which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "base64.b64decode() decodes to 'print(\"test\")', then exec() executes it.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on decoded data indicates obfuscated or dynamic code execution, a common technique for malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes the base64 string 'cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==', which translates to 'print(\"test\")'. It then executes this code with exec(). While this specific code outputs 'test' and is benign, the pattern of decoding and executing arbitrary code is suspicious and potentially malicious if the base64 string were to contain harmful instructions. The approach is obfuscated, likely to hide malicious intent or evade detection. The code's minimal structure and use of eval-like behavior point toward an attempt at obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code uses obfuscation to execute dynamically decoded code, which is a common trait of malicious scripts. Although the current payload is benign ('print(\"test\")'), the pattern is suspicious and could be used to hide malicious payloads. Due to its obfuscation and dynamic execution, this code should be treated as potentially malicious.",
