  "sinks": "exec() function executing the decoded string",
  "flows": "base64 decoding of the string, then execution of the resulting code via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on decoded data from a hardcoded string; the string decodes to a print statement, which is benign but the pattern suggests obfuscation potential",
  "analysis": "The code imports the base64 module, decodes a hardcoded base64 string to obtain a Python command, and then executes it with exec(). The base64 string decodes to 'print(\"test\")', which is benign. However, the use of exec() on hardcoded decoded data is suspicious, as it can be exploited to run arbitrary code if the base64 string is manipulated or replaced. The code appears obfuscated intentionally, possibly to hide malicious intent, but in this case, it only prints 'test'. Nevertheless, the pattern is common in malicious scripts to hide real payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation by using base64 decoding and exec() to run potentially hidden code. Although the current payload is benign, the pattern is typical of malicious obfuscation techniques. Caution is advised, and this pattern should be monitored for similar future code that could contain malicious payloads.",
