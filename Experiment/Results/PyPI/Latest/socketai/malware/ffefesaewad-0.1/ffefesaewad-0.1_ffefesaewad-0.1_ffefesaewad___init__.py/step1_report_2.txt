  "analysis": "The code imports the base64 module, decodes a base64-encoded string 'cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==' which decodes to 'print(\"test\")', and then executes it via exec(). The decoded code simply prints 'test' to the output, which is benign. However, the use of exec() on decoded data is a common pattern in malicious scripts to obfuscate behavior. In this case, the decoded content is harmless, but the pattern itself is suspicious, as it could be used to execute malicious code if the input changes.",
  "conclusion": "The code dynamically executes a decoded string, which could be malicious if the encoded content changes. Currently, it decodes to a harmless print statement, but the pattern of decoding and executing base64-encoded code is a security concern. Caution is advised if the encoded string could be controlled by an external source.",
