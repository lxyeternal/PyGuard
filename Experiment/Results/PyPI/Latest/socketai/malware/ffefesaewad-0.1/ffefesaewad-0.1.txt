      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with an unusual package name that does not suggest malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate; the minimal suspicion about the package name does not warrant higher risk or malware scores. Overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible."

Scores should reflect the pattern's inherent risk rather than the specific payload. Overall, the pattern should be flagged for ongoing monitoring, but the current code is not malicious."
