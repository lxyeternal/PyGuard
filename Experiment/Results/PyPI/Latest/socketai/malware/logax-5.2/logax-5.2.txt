      "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can lead to namespace issues but does not imply malicious intent. The actual security risk depends on the contents of 'info', which are not provided. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are justified."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors including remote code download and execution, obfuscation, and persistence mechanisms. The high malware score (0.85), obfuscation score (0.75), and security risk score (0.9) are justified based on these behaviors. It should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious, warranting further investigation and caution in deployment."
