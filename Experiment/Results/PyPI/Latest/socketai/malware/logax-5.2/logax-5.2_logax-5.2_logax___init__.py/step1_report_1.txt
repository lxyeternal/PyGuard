  "purpose": "Import all definitions and functions from the 'info' module within the same package",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .info import *' (importing all from a local module)",
  "sinks": "No sinks; this line only performs an import operation",
  "flows": "No data flow; import statement does not process untrusted input or data",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be considered a questionable practice, but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'info'. This is a standard import statement and does not execute any malicious code by itself. There are no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or data leaks present here. Since the code only performs a simple import, it is unlikely to be malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard import from a local module with no evident malicious behavior or security issues. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged but not malicious.",
