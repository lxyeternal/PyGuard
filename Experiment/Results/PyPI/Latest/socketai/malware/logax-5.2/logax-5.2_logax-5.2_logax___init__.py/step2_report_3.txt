  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code performs a relative import of all symbols from the 'info' module.\n- No runtime behavior, data processing, or malicious activity is visible in this snippet.\n- Use of `import *` is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution, but it is not inherently malicious.\n- The actual security implications depend heavily on the contents of the 'info' module, which are not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import all definitions/functions from 'info'.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that this is a standard import and not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.8, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low security risk score is appropriate, and malware score is correctly zero.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes potential risk due to wildcard import but finds no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.4.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score due to potential issues with wildcard import, which is justified. Malware remains zero.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis:** Similar reasoning; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.6.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments; the risk score is justified given the use of wildcard import, though no actual malicious activity is present.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Reiterates that the import is benign but notes the risk of namespace pollution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, confidence=0.5.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score here. Since no malicious activity is detected, a zero risk score could be justified, but a small risk score (e.g., 0.1) might be more precise to reflect the general concern about wildcard imports.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly conservative; the risk score could be adjusted to 0.1, but 0 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the import alone does not indicate malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.25, confidence=0.5.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score is somewhat higher than others, possibly due to the general caution about `import *`. Given no evidence of malicious behavior, a lower risk score (e.g., 0.1) might be more appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly overestimated; consider lowering to 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Scores:\n- **Malware:** All zero, consistent with the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated:** Zero in all cases, correct.\n- **Risk:** Generally low, reflecting the minimal code shown but acknowledging potential namespace pollution.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The malware scores are correct at zero.\n- The obfuscated scores are correct at zero.\n- The risk scores could be slightly adjusted downward, especially in reports 4 and 5, to reflect the benign nature of the code more accurately. A risk score of around 0.1 might be more appropriate than 0 or 0.2, considering that the only concern is the wildcard import practice.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to use of 'import *', which is generally discouraged but not malicious)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence, which shows only a simple import statement with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the contents of the imported module 'info' for a complete security assessment. Without that, we can only evaluate the import statement itself.",
