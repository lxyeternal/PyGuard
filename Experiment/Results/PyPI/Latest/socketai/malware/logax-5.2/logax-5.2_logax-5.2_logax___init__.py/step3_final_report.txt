  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local module 'info' using a relative import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or execution beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious content if 'info' is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import of all symbols from the 'info' module. No malicious code, dynamic execution, or network activity is present. The use of 'import *' is discouraged due to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious. The security implications depend on the contents of 'info', which are unknown. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, indicating no evidence of malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, as there is no obfuscation. The risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the potential concern about namespace pollution but no concrete threat. Confidence in this assessment is high given the minimal code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can lead to namespace issues but does not imply malicious intent. The actual security risk depends on the contents of 'info', which are not provided. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are justified.",
