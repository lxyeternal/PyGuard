  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .info import *`\n- This is a relative import of all symbols from a local module named `info`.\n- No other code, data flows, or suspicious behavior is present in these snippets.\n- The main concern raised is the use of `import *`, which is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The reports correctly identify that the code only performs an import statement and does not execute any malicious code or contain obfuscation. The concerns about `import *` are valid from a best practices perspective but do not imply malicious intent.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:\n- **Malware and risk scores:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the minimal code. The risk scores vary slightly (0.1 to 0.25), mostly reflecting caution about `import *`. These seem reasonable.\n- **Potential overestimation:**  \n  Since the code is only an import statement, assigning a high security risk (e.g., >0.5) would be unjustified unless additional context suggests malicious content in `info`. The reports do not assume this, which is correct.\n\n### Score suggestions:\n- The **malware scores** are appropriately set to 0 across all reports.\n- The **security risk scores** are somewhat conservative but acceptable, considering the potential dangers of wildcard imports, especially if `info` could be compromised. However, without evidence of malicious content, a risk score of 0.2-0.25 might be slightly high but still reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores >0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.25, which aligns with the minimal code. A higher score would require evidence of malicious content or dangerous behavior, which is absent here.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided. The malware scores are all 0, which is correct.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statement.\n- The confidence levels vary but are generally appropriate given the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (caution due to `import *`, but no actual threat)\n\n### Overall recommendation:\nGiven the minimal code and the analyses, I would assign the following scores:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0.2** |\n\n**Note:** The actual security concern hinges on what the `info` module contains. If `info` is malicious or compromised, the risk could be higher, but based solely on this snippet, the current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate in their analysis.\n- No evidence of malware or malicious activity.\n- The use of `import *` is a concern but not malicious.\n- Scores are reasonable and consistent with the evidence.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is benign, and the scores should remain low, reflecting minimal risk.",
