  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .info import *`.\n- The core concern revolves around the use of `import *`, which is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution and potential obscuration of malicious content.\n- None of the reports indicate any dynamic code execution, network activity, or other malicious behaviors within this snippet.\n- The actual content of the `info` module is unknown, which limits definitive conclusions about maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is a simple import statement; no issues are directly present within this snippet.\n- **Malicious code:** No evidence of malicious code, malware, or obfuscation is present here.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Data flows:** No data flow or untrusted input handling is involved.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are demonstrated in this isolated import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning issues:\n- The reports correctly identify that `import *` can be risky due to namespace pollution, but they do not consider that this risk depends on the contents of `info`.\n- Some reports suggest that the use of `import *` could hide malicious functions or variables if `info` is compromised. This is a valid concern but cannot be confirmed without inspecting `info`.\n- The reports appropriately conclude that, in isolation, the code appears benign.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is reasonable given the information.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is consistent.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.25; given the minimal code, these are acceptable but slightly conservative.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since the content of `info` is unknown, the actual security risk hinges on what `info` contains. If `info` contains malicious code, then the risk is higher, but this cannot be inferred solely from the import statement.\n- The use of `import *` is a best practice concern but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal code and no malicious indicators, a risk score of around 0.1-0.2 is appropriate, reflecting cautiousness but acknowledging benign intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code snippet is benign in isolation.\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged but not malicious.\n- The actual security implications depend entirely on the contents of the `info` module, which are not provided.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the evidence at hand.",
