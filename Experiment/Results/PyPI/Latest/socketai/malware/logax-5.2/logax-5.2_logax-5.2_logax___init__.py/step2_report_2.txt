  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate their conclusions, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports are about the same code: `from .info import *`.\n- The code is a simple import statement, with no additional logic.\n- The main concern revolves around the use of `import *` from a local module `info`.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior is present in the code snippet itself.\n- The actual security implications depend heavily on the contents of the `info` module, which is not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- **Issue presence:** The code itself does not execute any malicious code, perform data leaks, or involve dynamic code execution.\n- **Potential concern:** The use of `import *` can obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious functions or variables if `info` is compromised or malicious.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:\n- **No explicit errors** are evident in the reports; they correctly note that the code is benign in isolation.\n- **Overemphasis on `import *`:** While `import *` is discouraged, it is not inherently malicious. The reports correctly identify this but sometimes lean toward caution.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate given the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.25, which seems reasonable considering the potential risks of wildcard imports, but no concrete evidence is provided.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.25, which aligns with the minimal code and lack of evidence for malicious intent.\n- The risk could be higher if the contents of `info` are malicious, but since that cannot be assessed here, the scores are appropriately low.\n\n### Challenge assumptions:\n- The reports assume that the risk depends on the contents of `info`. This is correct.\n- They correctly state that the code alone is benign but could be risky depending on `info`.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal code and no malicious activity, a risk score of around 0.1-0.2 seems reasonable, but perhaps slightly lower than some reports suggest, considering the lack of context.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since the main concern is the use of `import *`, which can be risky but not malicious in itself)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign in isolation. The main concern is the potential for hidden malicious code within `info`, but this cannot be determined from the snippet alone. The current scores are reasonable and justified.",
