  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can lead to namespace issues but does not imply malicious intent. The actual security risk depends on the contents of 'info', which are not provided. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are justified."
