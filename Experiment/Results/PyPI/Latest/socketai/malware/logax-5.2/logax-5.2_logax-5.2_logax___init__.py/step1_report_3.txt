{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a module named 'info' in the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.info'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions are shown.",
  "flows": "N/A – only an import statement, so no data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure actual imported contents, but not inherently malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import from a module named 'info'. There are no further code statements, data processing, network activity, or credential handling. The import statement itself does not indicate malicious intent; it is a common pattern in Python packages. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The simplicity suggests benign behavior, but the actual safety depends on the contents of 'info', which are not provided here.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this single import statement, there is no evident malicious behavior or security risk. The code's potential risk depends on the contents of the 'info' module, which is not accessible here. The code appears benign in isolation.",
