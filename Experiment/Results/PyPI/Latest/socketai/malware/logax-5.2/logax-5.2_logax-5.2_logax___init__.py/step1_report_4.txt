{
  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from the local module 'info', likely to use its functions, variables, or classes.",
  "sources": "The import statement sourcing data or code from the local 'info' module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the imported symbols could be used elsewhere in the project as sinks, but within this snippet, no sinks are directly evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'info' module into the current namespace via import; however, no specific runtime data flow or untrusted input handling is shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import (*) can be considered a bad practice due to namespace pollution, but it is not inherently malicious. No signs of obfuscation or hidden code are present.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a standard import operation, bringing all symbols from a local module 'info' into the current namespace. There is no embedded logic, data handling, or suspicious activity. Since no runtime behavior is shown, potential malicious activity cannot be determined solely from this line. The import could be benign or malicious depending on what 'info' contains, but that is outside the scope of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This line alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior; it is a standard import statement. Without additional context or code, there are no indications of malware or security risks.",
