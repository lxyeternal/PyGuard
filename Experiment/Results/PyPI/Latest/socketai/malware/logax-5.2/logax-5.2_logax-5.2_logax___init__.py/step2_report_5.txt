  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the consistency of their assessments, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports analyze the same code snippet: `from .info import *`.\n- They uniformly conclude that this line alone is benign, with no malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The confidence levels vary between 0.4 and 0.8, generally moderate to high.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low, mostly around 0.1 to 0.25, which seems reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code **does** contain the exact line `from .info import *`.\n- **No** other code, data flows, or runtime behavior are provided.\n- The reports correctly identify that this line alone **does not** execute malicious code or handle untrusted data.\n- The concern about using `import *` is valid, but it **does not** imply malicious intent in isolation.\n\n### Errors or Flaws:\n- No factual errors are evident; all reports correctly interpret the code.\n- Some reports mention potential risks of namespace pollution or obscured contents, which is valid but not malicious.\n- The assessments appropriately avoid overestimating risk based solely on an import statement.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal threat level.\n- The confidence scores are reasonable, given the limited context.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since the code only imports a module, **no** evidence suggests malicious activity or malware.\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged but not inherently dangerous.\n- The actual risk depends on the contents of `info`, which are unknown here.\n\n### Potential improvements:\n- If `info` is a trusted internal module, the risk remains very low.\n- If `info` could be compromised or contain malicious code, the risk could be higher, but this cannot be assessed without further context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the provided code snippet and reports, I concur that:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting minimal risk due to namespace pollution concerns but no malicious activity.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign in isolation, and the scores are appropriate. The primary concern with such import statements is maintainability and namespace pollution, not security per se. No further action is necessary unless additional context or code is provided.",
