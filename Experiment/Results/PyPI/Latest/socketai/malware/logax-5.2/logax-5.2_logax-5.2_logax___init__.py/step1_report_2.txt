  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'info'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.info'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "The import statement pulls in data or functions from the local module, but there are no further data flows shown.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a relative import with '*' can be risky as it imports everything from 'info', which could include malicious or unintended code. No other code present to analyze for malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement using relative import syntax to include all definitions from 'info'. Without additional code, there are no obvious malicious behaviors or suspicious patterns. The import could be used to conceal malicious functions or variables if 'info' contains malicious content, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone. The code itself is minimal and standard, but the context of the 'info' module matters for full assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior. However, the use of a wildcard import from a potentially untrusted module could be risky if 'info' contains malicious code. No direct malware indicators are present in this minimal code fragment.",
