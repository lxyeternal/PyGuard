{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a module named 'info' within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'info' module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this snippet; potential sinks depend on how imported data is used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Potential flow involves importing all data and functions from 'info', which could then be used downstream.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .info import *' can be considered risky as it imports all names into the namespace, potentially overwriting existing variables or importing malicious code if 'info' is compromised. However, this alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a relative import of all contents from a module named 'info'. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs within this single line. The use of wildcard import can lead to namespace pollution, which might obscure malicious behavior, but by itself, it is a common pattern in Python code and not inherently malicious. No other code or context is provided to suggest malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The use of 'import *' is risky in general practice but does not indicate malicious intent here. Additional context is needed to assess overall security risk.",
