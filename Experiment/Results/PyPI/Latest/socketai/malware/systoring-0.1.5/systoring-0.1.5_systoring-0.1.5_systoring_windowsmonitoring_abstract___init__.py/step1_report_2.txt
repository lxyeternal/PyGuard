  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there are no data inputs or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports a class and defines an __all__ list for exports. There are no external data inputs, no runtime data handling, and no security-sensitive operations. The minimal nature of this code reduces risk and suggests standard module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple module declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. It is a typical pattern for Python packages to control exports. No malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
