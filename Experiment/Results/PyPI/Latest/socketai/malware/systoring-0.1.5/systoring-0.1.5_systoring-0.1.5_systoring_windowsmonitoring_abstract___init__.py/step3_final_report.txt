{
  "purpose": "Module exports the AbstractSender class from a local sender module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .sender import AbstractSender",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external data handling present",
  "flows": "Import source to __all__ declaration; no runtime data flow or external communication",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports a class from a relative module and declares __all__ for export. No data processing, user input, or external communication occurs. All reviews agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign module export pattern with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
