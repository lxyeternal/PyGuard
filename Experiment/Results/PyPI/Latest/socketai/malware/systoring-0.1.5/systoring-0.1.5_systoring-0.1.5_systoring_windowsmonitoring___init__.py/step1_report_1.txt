{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define an API interface by importing specific classes and enums from local modules for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing or external outputs are present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or external communication; the code only imports and exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected; simple import/export statements",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of import statements and an __all__ declaration, which defines public API symbols. There are no data manipulations, external network connections, or dynamic code execution. All modules are imported from local files, and no suspicious patterns or embedded secrets are evident. The purpose seems to be structuring the package's public interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely organizes imports and public API exposure. There are no indicators of malware or security issues.",
