  "purpose": "This code defines the public API of a Python package by importing specific classes and enums from local modules and listing them in __all__ for export.",
  "sources": "Imports from .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only performs static imports and exports",
  "flows": "Import statements serve as sources; no data flows to sinks as there are no runtime data manipulations or external communications",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard package initialization file with straightforward import/export statements",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py or module index file that imports classes and enums from local modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no data processing, network activity, dynamic code execution, or embedded secrets. The code's purpose is purely organizational, and it does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions. All reports correctly identify this benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup file with no indicators of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with its simple, structural purpose. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
