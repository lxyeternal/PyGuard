{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an __init__.py module that imports and exposes classes and enums from other modules within the same package for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing are present; the code only performs imports and __all__ declaration",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; this code is only defining exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer that imports specific classes and enums from local modules and defines __all__ for module exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no external data input, and no complex logic. The import statements are standard and only reference local modules, which indicates typical package structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply organizes the package exports. No anomalies, malware, or security concerns detected.",
