  "purpose": "This code appears to define exports for a Python module related to system monitoring and utilities, likely for Windows monitoring tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows; simply imports and an __all__ declaration for module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The code is straightforward and primarily structural.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements and an export declaration (__all__). It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or malicious actions. The imported modules are likely part of a larger project focused on Windows system monitoring and utilities. No suspicious behavior or security risks are identifiable in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export setup with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It functions as an index of publicly accessible components for a monitoring library.",
