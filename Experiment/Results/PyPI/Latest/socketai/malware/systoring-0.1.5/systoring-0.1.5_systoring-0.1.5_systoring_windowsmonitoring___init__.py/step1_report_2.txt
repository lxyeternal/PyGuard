{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and constants for use in a larger application, likely related to Windows monitoring and utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: 'windowsmonitoring', 'enums', and 'utils'. No direct data input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow paths are observable in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and standard for module initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes and variables from local modules and defines the __all__ list for export. There are no suspicious behaviors, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no external communications. The structure suggests typical Python package setup for modular design.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module import and export definition with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any actions beyond defining what symbols are available for import.",
