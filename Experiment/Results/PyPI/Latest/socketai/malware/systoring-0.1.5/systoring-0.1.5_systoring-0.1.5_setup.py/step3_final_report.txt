{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining metadata, dependencies, and optional platform-specific requirements.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata and dependencies specified directly in code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a static README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and optional extras for Windows and macOS. There are no dynamic behaviors, no user input, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code. Dependencies are common for system monitoring tools, aligning with the package description. All signals indicate benign, standard configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned by the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0—are accurate and justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
