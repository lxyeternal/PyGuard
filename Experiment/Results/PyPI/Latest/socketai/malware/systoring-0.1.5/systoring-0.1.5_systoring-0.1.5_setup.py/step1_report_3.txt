{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'systoring' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and packaging information.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long_description; static strings for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; setup process uses static data only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup script with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools to configure a Python package. It reads a README file for long description and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and optional requirements. No user input, network activity, or malicious code is present. Dependencies are standard and relate to the package functionality. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscation. The script follows conventional practices for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign and standard setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks.",
