{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a comprehensive Windows data stealer, collecting passwords, cookies, history, bookmarks, extensions, wallets, and system information, then packaging and exfiltrating this data via external senders. It employs multi-threading and multiprocessing, disables SSL verification globally, and targets multiple browsers and applications, indicating malicious intent for covert data theft.",
  "sources": "Input data is gathered from browser profiles, system processes, command-line arguments, configuration files, and application modules such as Discord, Telegram, Steam, and wallets.",
  "sinks": "Collected data is compressed into zip files and previews, then transmitted through external sender objects, representing data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from various sources (browsers, system info, applications) into storage and packaging modules, then through sender objects over the network, with SSL verification disabled to facilitate covert transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ssl._create_unverified_context to disable SSL verification globally; broad collection of sensitive data without explicit user consent; terminology ('Multi stealer') suggesting malicious intent; no obfuscation detected; no explicit malicious payloads like backdoors or reverse shells.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for extensive data collection from browsers and system components, packaging this data, and exfiltrating it over the network. The disabling of SSL verification and the terminology used strongly suggest malicious surveillance or data theft. No obfuscated code or overt malicious payloads are present, but the behavior aligns with malware designed for covert exfiltration. The structure and scope of data collection, combined with network transmission, justify high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of a data-stealing malware, capable of covertly exfiltrating sensitive user data. While no explicit malicious payloads are visible, its design and techniques strongly indicate malicious intent, warranting high security concern.",
