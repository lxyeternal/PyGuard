{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports specific classes from local submodules and exports them for external use, likely as part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions; no external network or data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports class names",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from relative modules and defines __all__ for export. It lacks any dynamic execution, data processing, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The minimal structure indicates a straightforward module setup without suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module that re-exports classes from submodules, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
