{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or interface, importing specific classes from sibling modules and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from local module files (.ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb) during import statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing classes from local modules; no data flows from sources to sinks as there are no such operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with standard import statements and an __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup that imports classes from sibling modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, data handling, or obfuscation. The class names and import patterns are typical for a package's __init__.py or interface file. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with confidence scores of 1. The code's simplicity and clarity support these conclusions, and no further analysis or action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module interface with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are needed.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
