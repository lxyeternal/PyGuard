  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports classes from other modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data handling or untrusted data processing",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; just import statements and an __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of import statements from sibling modules and an __all__ declaration listing the imported classes. No execution of dynamic code, network activity, or data processing is present. The code appears to be a straightforward module definition meant for organizing exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module that imports classes from other modules and exposes them. No malicious or security issues are detected.",
