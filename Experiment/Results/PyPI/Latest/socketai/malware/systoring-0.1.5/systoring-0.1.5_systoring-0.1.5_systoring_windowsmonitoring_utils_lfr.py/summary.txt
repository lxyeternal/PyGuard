  "conclusion": "The code functions as a downloader and silent executor, with features that can be exploited for malicious purposes. While not inherently malicious, its design enables potential abuse, warranting a high malware and security risk score. The behavior aligns with a high potential for malicious activity if misused, especially in untrusted environments."
