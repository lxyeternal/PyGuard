  "purpose": "Initialize and start platform-specific system monitoring and input monitoring threads based on the operating system.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for OS detection; instantiation of MacMonitor and WindowsMonitor; input_monitor.start() for user input monitoring.",
  "targets": "Methods within MacMonitor and WindowsMonitor classes; InputMonitor's start_monitoring method.",
  "flows": "platform.system() reads OS info -> starts input monitoring thread -> conditionally starts OS-specific monitoring threads.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of threading appears standard for monitoring tasks. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the OS using platform.system(), then spawns threads to run input monitoring and system-specific monitoring classes. All class names and methods suggest legitimate monitoring functions. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, unauthorized access, or obfuscation. The use of threading for monitoring is common. No suspicious inputs or sinks identified. No unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward platform-dependent monitoring initializer with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a legitimate monitoring tool.",
