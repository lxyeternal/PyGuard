  "purpose": "Initialize and run platform-specific system monitoring threads for macOS or Windows.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for platform detection, InputMonitor().start_monitoring() for input monitoring, MacMonitor().run or WindowsMonitor().run for system monitoring.",
  "sinks": "Threads executing monitoring functions, which could potentially be misused if malicious code is present within these monitoring classes.",
  "flows": "platform.system() output determines which monitoring class is instantiated; the start_monitoring method is called for input; run methods are invoked for platform-specific monitoring, all within separate threads.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior evident. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Usage appears standard for a monitoring setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports platform detection, input monitoring, and platform-specific monitoring classes. It starts input monitoring in a thread, then initiates platform-dependent system monitoring in separate threads based on the OS detected. The structure is straightforward and typical for monitoring applications. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration are visible. The classes imported may contain their own risks, but based solely on this code, there is no evidence of malicious intent. The code operates as a simple platform-aware monitoring initializer.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward platform-specific system monitoring initializer, launching input and system monitors in separate threads. There are no indications of malicious behavior or malicious code within this snippet. The monitoring classes' internal implementations should be reviewed separately for potential risks, but this code alone appears benign.",
