  "purpose": "Initialize platform-specific system monitoring and input monitoring in separate threads based on the detected OS.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call for OS detection; InputMonitor().start_monitoring() for input data; imported classes MacMonitoring, WindowsMonitoring for system monitoring.",
  "sinks": "Thread targets executing monitoring functions; potential data leakage if imported modules mishandle data or contain malicious code.",
  "flows": "OS detection from platform.system() → starting input monitor thread → starting platform-specific monitor thread based on OS.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward threading and platform detection logic; no obfuscation or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard platform detection and initializes monitoring threads accordingly. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The imported modules could contain risks, but that is outside the scope of this snippet. The threading and platform logic are correctly implemented, and no suspicious patterns are evident. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. The overall structure aligns with typical monitoring setup code, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard platform-aware monitoring initializer with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis. The main concern would be the trustworthiness of imported modules, which cannot be assessed here.",
