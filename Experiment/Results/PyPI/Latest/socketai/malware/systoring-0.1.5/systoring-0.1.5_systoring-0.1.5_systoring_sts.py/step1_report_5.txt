  "purpose": "Initialize and start system monitoring threads for macOS and Windows platforms.",
  "sources": "Imports from systoring.macosmonitoring.macmonitoring, systoring.kl.input_monitor, and conditionally from systoring.windowsmonitoring.windowsmonitoring; platform.system() call; threading.Thread initialization with monitor methods.",
  "sinks": "threading.Thread target functions: InputMonitor().start_monitoring, MacMonitor().run, WindowsMonitor().run.",
  "flows": "platform.system() output influences which monitor thread is started; input monitoring runs on a separate thread; platform-specific system monitor runs on a separate thread.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior; code mainly manages thread initialization and platform detection.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the OS platform and starts corresponding monitoring threads, which are imported modules presumed to monitor system activity. No signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior are evident. The input monitor and system monitors are started as separate threads, which is typical for monitoring tools. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be designed for legitimate system monitoring functionality. There is no indication of malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward platform-based system monitoring thread initialization. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The structure and functionality align with legitimate monitoring purposes, with no signs of malware or supply chain threats.",
