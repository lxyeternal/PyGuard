  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard platform-aware monitoring initializer with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis. The main concern would be the trustworthiness of imported modules, which cannot be assessed here."
