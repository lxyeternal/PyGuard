  "purpose": "Import platform-specific monitoring classes and functions for system monitoring and input monitoring.",
  "sources": "Reads the system platform information using platform.system()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> condition check -> conditional import of WindowsMonitoring",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import based on platform; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports modules based on the detected operating system, which is standard practice for cross-platform compatibility. It uses platform.system() to determine the OS and conditionally imports Windows-specific monitoring if on Windows. The rest are module imports and defining __all__, with no apparent malicious or suspicious behavior. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The code appears to be straightforward and adheres to typical patterns for modular platform-specific code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module that conditionally imports platform-specific monitoring classes and functions. No malicious intent or security risks are identified based on this snippet.",
