  "purpose": "Import platform-specific monitoring modules and initialize system monitoring functions.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call to determine the OS, import statements for local modules.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sinks or external communication in this code.",
  "flows": "OS detection flow controls which modules are imported; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import based on OS is standard; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports modules depending on the operating system, specifically importing WindowsMonitoring only on Windows systems. The other imports are static. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or data leakage. The modules being imported could contain malicious code, but from this fragment alone, the import logic is straightforward and typical for cross-platform compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard OS-dependent import pattern used in cross-platform Python applications. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident from this snippet.",
