  "purpose": "Platform detection and conditional import of OS-specific modules for monitoring.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call to determine OS; import statements for macosmonitoring, windowsmonitoring, sts, kl modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only module imports and OS detection.",
  "flows": "platform.system() output influences whether WindowsMonitoring is imported; other modules are imported unconditionally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward platform detection and import pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard OS check using platform.system(), conditionally imports WindowsMonitoring if on Windows, and always imports MacMonitoring, initialize_system_monitoring, and InputMonitor. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The code is simple, clear, and follows common cross-platform patterns. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The only potential concern is the imported modules, which are outside the scope of this snippet. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero; the security risk score should be zero given the benign nature of the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for platform-specific module imports with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minimal security risk is justified solely by the code's simplicity; imported modules could pose risks but cannot be assessed here. Overall, the supply chain component appears safe.",
