{
  "purpose": "The code appears to conditionally import platform-specific modules for system monitoring and exposes them for external use.",
  "sources": "Reads the system platform type using 'platform.system()'; imports modules based on platform condition; imports functions/classes from relative modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is written or sent over network; no user input handling or sensitive data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Determines platform type, then conditionally imports modules accordingly; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard platform detection and conditional imports; no suspicious or obfuscated behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports modules based on the system platform, which is standard practice for platform-specific functionality. All imports are local or relative, and there are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or dynamic code execution. The purpose appears to be organizing platform-specific monitoring modules without exposing sensitive data or executing hidden code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward platform detection and module import script, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation for modular system monitoring.",
