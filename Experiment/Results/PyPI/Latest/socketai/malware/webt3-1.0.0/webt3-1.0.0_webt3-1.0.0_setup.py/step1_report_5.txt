  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'webt3' with custom installation behavior, including encrypted code execution during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), imports modules ('os', 'requests', 'fernet'), and executes decrypted code via exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which could run arbitrary or malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Environment check (os.name) -> conditional import of requests and Fernet -> decrypts and executes code via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted string and exec() call, which dynamically executes code obtained at runtime. The use of Fernet for decrypting code indicates obfuscation and potentially malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines setup parameters for a Python package 'webt3'. A custom 'install' command class is implemented, which, during installation on Windows ('nt'), imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts an encrypted payload with Fernet and executes it dynamically using exec(). This behavior is suspicious because it executes decrypted code at install time without transparency. The encrypted payload could contain malicious code, backdoors, or other harmful actions. The encrypted string and dynamic execution are common obfuscation techniques to hide malicious behavior. The use of 'exec' on decrypted code during installation poses significant security risks, as it can run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Overall, the code demonstrates potentially malicious obfuscation and execution of hidden payloads during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains obfuscated and potentially malicious code that executes a decrypted payload during installation on Windows systems. The use of encrypted strings and exec() to run decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent or backdoor functionality. Caution is advised before using this package.",
