{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'webt3' with custom installation behavior that executes encrypted code during installation if run on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, package metadata, and imports external modules such as 'os', 'requests', and 'fernet'. The main source of potentially malicious activity is the 'exec' call with decrypted code.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec' function executes decrypted code which is fetched during installation, representing a sink that executes untrusted code obtained from decryption.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves checking if the operating system is Windows, then importing 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypting an encrypted payload, and executing it via 'exec'. This decrypted code can perform arbitrary actions, including network communication or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a base64-encoded encrypted payload decrypted at runtime and executed via 'exec', which is suspicious. The code does not specify the contents of the payload, making it opaque. The 'long_description' appears random, possibly obfuscation or filler. The 'cmdclass' key uses a highly obfuscated variable name, and the code dynamically executes code based on OS check, which is unusual for standard setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a non-standard, obfuscated class 'eqXEOOWKVvPMMTaTVyBGejYKtWOuEyLzCsaRpSygGAwkTfgSlEVtmTAwvifCiXrEMyeTGdwXfJNUGXJJzXKIYFAxGqFVbeCgAzKAEoELEacliYdCohuMbeVzlOGeYyAplvtRuvFrYxxRYvGIFyknJrfihVhoIWeVmRpnRvZXRBoBnLjZeetXQLsYlDsqv' assigned to 'install'. During its 'run' method, it checks if the OS is Windows, then decrypts and executes code. The use of 'exec' with decrypted payload indicates a potential malicious backdoor or malicious logic execution at install time. The encrypted payload is a clear indicator of obfuscation. The rest of the setup, including package metadata, appears normal. The package setup requires 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used for network and cryptographic operations. Overall, the key concern is the runtime decryption and execution of code, which is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes obfuscated, encrypted payload execution during installation, which poses a significant security risk. It likely serves as a backdoor or malicious component executed on Windows systems. The rest of the setup appears normal but is overshadowed by this suspicious behavior.",
