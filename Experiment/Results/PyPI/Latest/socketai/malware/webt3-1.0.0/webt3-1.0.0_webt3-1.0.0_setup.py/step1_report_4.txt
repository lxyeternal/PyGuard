{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'webt3', including custom install behavior that decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.name), reads setup parameters, imports modules (setuptools, os, requests, fernet). Executes encrypted code within the custom install command.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, potentially malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "During installation, if OS is Windows, decrypts data with Fernet and executes it via exec(), representing a direct execution flow from decrypted payload to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload decrypted at runtime and executed directly; no visible hardcoded secrets but encrypted code indicates obfuscation or concealment of malicious logic; unusual custom installation class name and structure; setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests' without explicit validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, when run on Windows, imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'fernet', then decrypts a payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and executes it via exec(). The payload is encrypted and stored as a byte string, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. The use of exec() on decrypted code is highly suspicious, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The setup process also uses a non-standard class name and obfuscated code, which can be indicative of malicious intent. No other benign purpose for decrypting and executing code during setup is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains a high-risk behavior: it decrypts and executes code at installation time on Windows, which can be malicious. The use of encrypted payload and runtime code execution suggests malicious intent or backdoor capability. The overall security risk is high.",
