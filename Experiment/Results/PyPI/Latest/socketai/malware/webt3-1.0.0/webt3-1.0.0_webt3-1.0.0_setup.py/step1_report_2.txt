{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'webt3', with a custom install command that executes decryption and code execution during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for version, description, and long description; imports from setuptools and os; environment detection via os.name; and performs an import of requests and Fernet during the custom install run.",
  "sinks": "The execution of Fernet-decrypted code via exec() with potentially decrypted data that can contain malicious code. No other explicit sinks detected.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules, then during installation, if on Windows (nt), decrypting data with Fernet and executing it via exec(), which could lead to malicious behavior if the encrypted payload is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted data and dynamic code execution via exec() in the install command, which is suspicious. The long description and description are nonsensical or obfuscated. The code decrypts and executes code conditionally on Windows, indicating a potential backdoor or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and a custom installation class that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload, then executes the payload via exec(). The payload's purpose is unknown but could contain malicious code. The encrypted payload and key are hardcoded, which is suspicious. The code may be designed to silently execute malicious code during installation. The rest of the setup script appears standard, but the dynamic code execution raises a high security concern.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains a likely malicious backdoor mechanism: during installation on Windows, it decrypts and executes arbitrary code, which could be malicious. The encrypted payload and decryption step are typical indicators of obfuscated malicious activity. Overall, this package should be considered dangerous for deployment.",
