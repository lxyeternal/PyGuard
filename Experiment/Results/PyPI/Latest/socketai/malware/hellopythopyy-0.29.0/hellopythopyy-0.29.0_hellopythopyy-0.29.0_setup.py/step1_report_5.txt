{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup process that downloads and executes an external executable during installation.",
  "sources": "The URL in the send() function where an external file is downloaded, and the open() call writing the downloaded content to a file.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call that executes the downloaded executable, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "The send() function retrieves a file from the internet and writes it locally, then os.system() executes the downloaded file, which could be malicious.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically downloads and executes an external executable during package installation without user consent or validation, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and a requests library, then defines a function 'send' that downloads an executable from a specified URL and executes it immediately. This behavior is unusual and malicious in the context of a package setup, as it introduces an external dependency and executes code outside the package's scope during installation. The setup() function uses a custom install command that runs 'send()', ensuring this behavior occurs whenever the package is installed. Such actions can lead to remote code execution, malware installation, or system compromise. No validation, user prompts, or checks are performed before executing the external executable, which is a severe security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external file during package installation without any validation, representing a significant security risk. This behavior indicates an intentionally malicious intent, making this package dangerous to install.",
