  "conclusion": "The setup.py is benign, with no malicious code or obfuscation. The only concern is the 'python_requires' version specifier, which is likely a typo or misconfiguration rather than malicious. The current scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the risk score can be set to 0 or very slightly above zero (e.g., 0.05) to reflect the configuration issue. Overall, the package is safe for use."
