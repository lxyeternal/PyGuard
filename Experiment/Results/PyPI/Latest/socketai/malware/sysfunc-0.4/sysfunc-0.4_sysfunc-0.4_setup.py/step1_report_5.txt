  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'sysfunc' Python library, defining package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration data directly within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the strict Python version requirement '==3.13.*', which may cause installation issues but is not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and configuration. It specifies package name, version, included packages, author, and license information. The Python version requirement is unusually strict but not malicious. No code execution, data handling, or network activity occurs within this script. No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup configuration for packaging a Python library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
