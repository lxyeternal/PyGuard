{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script defines package metadata for 'sysfunc', a Python library for system interactions, with no malicious code or behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata; no external input or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code is static and configuration-based.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script is purely declarative with no dynamic execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the 'python_requires=\"==3.13.*\"' specification, which is an unconventional and possibly non-existent Python version, potentially causing installation issues but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with package metadata. No dynamic code, network activity, or data handling occurs. The 'python_requires' field's unusual version specifier is likely a typo or misconfiguration, not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (mostly 0, with one at 0.1) reflecting the version specification anomaly. The confidence levels are high, and no evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is benign, with no malicious code or obfuscation. The only concern is the 'python_requires' version specifier, which is likely a typo or misconfiguration rather than malicious. The current scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the risk score can be set to 0 or very slightly above zero (e.g., 0.05) to reflect the configuration issue. Overall, the package is safe for use.",
