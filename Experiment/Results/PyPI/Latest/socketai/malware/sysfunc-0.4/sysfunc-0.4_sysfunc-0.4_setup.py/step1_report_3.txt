{
  "purpose": "To define and configure the package metadata and installation parameters for the 'sysfunc' Python library.",
  "sources": "The entire setup.py file, primarily the setup() function call which contains package information and configuration details.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the script primarily prepares package installation metadata. No untrusted data handling or external data flow is present.",
  "flows": "The script flows from importing modules to calling setup() with static parameters. No dynamic or untrusted data flow is detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code uses standard setup tools conventions and static configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script utilizing setuptools to specify package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and compatibility. The Python version requirement specifies 3.13.*, which is a recent or potentially non-standard version, but this alone is not suspicious. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling. All components are typical for Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is legitimate, standard, and contains no malicious behavior. It simply defines package metadata and installation parameters. No malicious intent or security risks are present based on this script.",
