      "conclusion": "The setup.py is benign, with no malicious code or obfuscation. The only concern is the 'python_requires' version specifier, which is likely a typo or misconfiguration rather than malicious. The current scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the risk score can be set to 0 or very slightly above zero (e.g., 0.05) to reflect the configuration issue. Overall, the package is safe for use."

Static analysis cannot confirm malicious intent, but the obfuscation and encrypted data justify cautious handling. The assigned scores are appropriate; the malware suspicion is moderate. Further runtime or behavioral analysis is advised to determine if malicious code is executed."
