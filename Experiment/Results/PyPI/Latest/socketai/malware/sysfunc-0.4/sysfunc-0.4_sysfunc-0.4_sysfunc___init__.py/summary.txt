  "conclusion": "This is a heavily obfuscated PyArmor protection wrapper with encrypted payloads. Static analysis cannot confirm malicious intent, but the obfuscation and encrypted data justify cautious handling. The assigned scores are appropriate; the malware suspicion is moderate. Further runtime or behavioral analysis is advised to determine if malicious code is executed."
