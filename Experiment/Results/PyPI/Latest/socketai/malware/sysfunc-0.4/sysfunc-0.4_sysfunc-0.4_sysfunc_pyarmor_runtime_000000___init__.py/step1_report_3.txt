{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for obfuscation or license management purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; simply imports a module",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating trial version and license expiration date; no suspicious or malicious code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement from a relative module 'pyarmor_runtime', with an accompanying comment about the Pyarmor version and expiration date. This suggests the code is part of an obfuscated or protected script using Pyarmor. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The comment indicates license info but does not imply malicious intent. No anomalous or unusual code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import of a runtime module used for obfuscation or licensing. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
