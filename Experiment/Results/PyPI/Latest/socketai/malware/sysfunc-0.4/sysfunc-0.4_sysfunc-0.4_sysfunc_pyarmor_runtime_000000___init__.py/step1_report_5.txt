  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or licensing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; import is static",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating trial version and expiration date, which is typical for licensing, but the date does not suggest malicious intent. No suspicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module related to Pyarmor, a legitimate obfuscation tool. The comment references the Pyarmor version, license type (trial), and an expiration date, which are standard in licensed software. No code execution, data handling, or suspicious patterns observed. No evidence of malicious activity or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard import statement for the Pyarmor runtime, associated with code obfuscation or licensing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected.",
