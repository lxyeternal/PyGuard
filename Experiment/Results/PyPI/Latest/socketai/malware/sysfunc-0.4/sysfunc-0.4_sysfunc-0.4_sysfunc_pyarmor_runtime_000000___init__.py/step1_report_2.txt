{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ module from the local package, likely related to code obfuscation or runtime protection.",
  "sources": "The code reads a local module '.pyarmor_runtime' which is presumably part of the package files.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data, external communication, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing a module to making the __pyarmor__ object available in the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The comment mentions 'Pyarmor 9.0.6 (trial)', which indicates usage of the Pyarmor obfuscation tool; this is not inherently malicious but suggests code protection measures. The code itself is minimal and typical for obfuscated or protected code, with no suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple import statement from a local module, likely part of a larger obfuscated or protected package. The comment indicates the use of Pyarmor for code obfuscation or licensing purposes. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious operations are present in this snippet. It does not perform any network activity, data collection, or other risky actions. The minimal and straightforward nature of the code suggests it's part of an obfuscated package designed to prevent reverse engineering.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard import statement related to Pyarmor obfuscation with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is typical for protected Python packages and does not pose a security threat.",
