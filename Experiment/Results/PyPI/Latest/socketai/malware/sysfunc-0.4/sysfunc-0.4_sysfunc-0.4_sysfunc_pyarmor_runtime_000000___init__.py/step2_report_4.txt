  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippets, the context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe minimal import statements from a local or relative module named `.pyarmor_runtime`, importing `__pyarmor__`.\n- The comments mention Pyarmor 9.0.6 (trial) with expiration dates, indicating use of the Pyarmor obfuscation tool, which is a legitimate software for protecting Python code.\n- No report indicates any suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code that could be malicious.\n- The code snippets are very simple and standard for obfuscated or protected Python packages.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated scores are high (mostly 0.8 or above), consistent with the use of obfuscation tools.\n- Security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature of these snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as simple import statements for the Pyarmor runtime module.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence supports malicious intent; scores of 0 for malware are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** High obfuscation scores are justified given the use of Pyarmor.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The comments about trial expiration do not indicate vulnerabilities but licensing limitations; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n- The **malware scores** are all 0, which is correct given the benign nature.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are high (0.8+), justified by the presence of obfuscation tooling.\n- The **security risk scores** are very low, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Any discrepancies or suggestions:\n- The reports are consistent with the code snippets.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.8-0.9), appropriate for the straightforward analysis.\n- No report suggests any suspicious activity that warrants raising the malware score.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, legitimate part of a protected Python package using Pyarmor.\n- The use of trial licenses and obfuscation is common and not malicious.\n- No evidence supports any malicious or security-compromising behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.8 (consistent with use of obfuscation tools)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal security risk, mostly licensing and obfuscation)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code snippets are benign, primarily related to code protection and obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0.8**  \n- Risk: **0.1**",
