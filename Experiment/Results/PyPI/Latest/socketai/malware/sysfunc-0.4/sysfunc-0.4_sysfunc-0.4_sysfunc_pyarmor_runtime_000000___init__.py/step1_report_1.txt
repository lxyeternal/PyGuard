{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ module from the pyarmor_runtime package, likely for code obfuscation or runtime protection purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __pyarmor__ from pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data leak points; no untrusted data handling or output functions",
  "flows": "Import statement loads __pyarmor__ module, potentially used elsewhere for obfuscation or runtime control",
  "anomalies": "Presence of pyarmor, which is often used for code obfuscation, but not inherently malicious; the comment indicates trial version and a future expiry date",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement for the pyarmor runtime, a legitimate tool used for code obfuscation and licensing protection. The comment mentions Pyarmor 9.0.6 trial and an expiration date, which suggests this is part of a protected or obfuscated package. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, malicious control flow, or hidden code is present. The only noteworthy aspect is the inclusion of obfuscation tooling, which is common in protected Python packages but not malicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of a protected or obfuscated Python package using Pyarmor. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
