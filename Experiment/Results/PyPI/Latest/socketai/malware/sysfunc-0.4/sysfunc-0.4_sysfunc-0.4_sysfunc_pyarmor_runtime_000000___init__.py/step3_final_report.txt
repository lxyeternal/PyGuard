{
  "purpose": "Import __pyarmor__ from the local runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or licensing purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no data leaks or external effects identified.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a simple import with no data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and typical for obfuscated or protected packages.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement associated with Pyarmor, a legitimate obfuscation tool. The comments indicate a trial license with an expiration date, which is standard for licensing management. No suspicious behavior, network activity, or malicious code is present. The high obfuscation score aligns with the use of Pyarmor, and malware or security risk scores are appropriately low. The code's purpose is to support obfuscation or licensing, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, part of a protected package using Pyarmor for obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are justified and consistent with the code's purpose.",
