{
  "purpose": "Download and execute a remote payload without validation, likely malicious.",
  "sources": "wget command fetching from IP 122.51.221.63, reading from the network.",
  "sinks": "Executing the downloaded file 'pytorch' via nohup, running system commands.",
  "flows": "wget from remote IP -> chmod +x -> nohup ./pytorch in background.",
  "anomalies": "Remote code download without validation, use of nohup to hide activity, filename 'pytorch' misleading, no error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs an unvalidated remote download and execution, indicative of malicious activity. It lacks validation, uses background execution to hide, and connects to an untrusted IP. The pattern matches typical malware delivery methods. No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward. Given the behavior, high suspicion of malicious intent is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, executing remote code without validation, posing a severe security risk. It should be classified with maximum malware and risk scores.",
