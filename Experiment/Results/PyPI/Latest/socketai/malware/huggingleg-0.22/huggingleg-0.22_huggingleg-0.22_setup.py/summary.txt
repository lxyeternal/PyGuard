  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-probability malicious behavior by downloading and executing external code without validation, constituting a severe security risk. The scores should be set to maximum (malware: 1, security risk: 1), aligning with the observed behavior. The pattern is typical of supply chain attacks or malware delivery, warranting immediate caution and review."
