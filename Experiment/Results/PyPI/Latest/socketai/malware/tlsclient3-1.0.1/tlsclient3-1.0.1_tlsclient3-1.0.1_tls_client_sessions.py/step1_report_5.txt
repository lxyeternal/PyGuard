{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Session class for making HTTP requests with advanced TLS and HTTP/2 configurations, including cookie management, request customization, and cleanup procedures.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from method parameters (such as URL, headers, cookies, data), environment variables (if used elsewhere), and configuration attributes within the class.",
  "sinks": "The code sends network requests via the 'request' function, processes responses, and frees memory allocated by external C functions. It handles cookie storage, request payloads, and response processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and class attributes into request payloads, which are serialized and passed to an external C-based request function. Responses are received as byte arrays, decoded, and processed into Response objects.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses external C functions 'request', 'freeMemory', and 'destroySession', which could be suspicious if misused. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious endpoints are present. The use of memory management functions suggests potential for misuse if the external C functions are malicious or insecure, but based solely on this code, their purpose appears to be session cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard, albeit complex, implementation of an HTTP session with advanced TLS options. It manages cookies, headers, and request payloads securely. The use of external C functions for network requests and memory management warrants attention, but within this code, these are used for session destruction and request handling. No signs of malicious data leakage, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The inclusion of external C functions might pose risk if those functions are malicious or compromised, but this cannot be determined from the code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a customizable HTTP session class. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident. External functions should be reviewed separately for security, but within this code, there are no signs of malware or security risks.",
