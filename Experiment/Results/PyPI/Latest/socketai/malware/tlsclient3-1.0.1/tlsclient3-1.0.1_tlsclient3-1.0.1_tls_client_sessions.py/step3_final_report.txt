  "purpose": "A sophisticated HTTP session manager with advanced TLS, cookie, and request configuration, utilizing external C functions for memory management and request handling.",
  "sources": "User inputs, internal UUIDs, request parameters, headers, cookies, external functions (`request`, `freeMemory`, `destroySession`), environment variables (if any).",
  "sinks": "Request payloads sent via external `request` function, response data decoded and processed, cookies stored in jar, memory freed via external functions.",
  "flows": "Input data (headers, cookies, request data) flows into request payloads, which are serialized and sent through external request; responses are decoded, cookies updated, and response objects built.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ctypes and external C functions (`destroySession`, `freeMemory`) for memory management and request handling; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages HTTP sessions with extensive TLS and HTTP/2 configurations, using external C functions for session destruction and memory management. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External functions pose potential risk if compromised, but the code itself appears legitimate and well-structured. Data flows from user inputs and internal state into request payloads, with response processing and cookie management handled appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, advanced HTTP client with configurable TLS features. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are evident. External C functions should be reviewed externally for security, but the Python code itself is safe.",
