  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, loading metadata and data files, with no malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from __version__.py via exec(), reads README.md, glob for data files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows detected.",
  "flows": "exec() executes __version__.py content; no external flows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on local version file; project URL points to a YouTube video, which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py with dynamic version loading via exec(), which is common but can be risky if the version file is compromised. No network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The project URL is unusual but not malicious. All reports agree on the absence of malware, with concern mainly about exec() pattern. The risk score should be low, around 0.2, assuming the version file is trusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which should be verified for integrity. Overall, the supply chain risk is low.",
