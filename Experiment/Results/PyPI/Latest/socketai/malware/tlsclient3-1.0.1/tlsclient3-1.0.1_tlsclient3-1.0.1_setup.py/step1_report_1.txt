{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to set up a Python package by reading package metadata, gathering data files, and configuring package details for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package version info from '__version__.py', reads README.md for long description, and glob patterns for data files.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no potential for data leakage or malicious action.",
  "flows": "Reads version and description info, processes package files, and executes setup configuration; no data flows into or out of untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'exec' to run code from '__version__.py' could be risky if the file is compromised, but is common in setup scripts; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package metadata and data files, then configures setup parameters using setuptools. The only dynamic execution involves reading a version file, which is standard practice but could be risky if the file contents are malicious. No external network connections, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors are detected. The data handling appears straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The only minor concern is the use of 'exec' on local version files, which is common but should be verified to be safe. Overall, the script is low risk.",
