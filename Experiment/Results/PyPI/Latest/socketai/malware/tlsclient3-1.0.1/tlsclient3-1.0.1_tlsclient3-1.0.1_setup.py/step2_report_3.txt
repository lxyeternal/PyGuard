  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, no malicious behavior, minor concern about `exec()` on version file.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; `exec()` is common but should be verified. No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, notes the unconventional URL pointing to a YouTube video, but considers it non-malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Comments:** The URL is suspicious but not malicious; the main concern remains the `exec()` pattern.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard nature, highlights `exec()` risk, but assumes the version file is controlled.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Comments:** Consistent with previous; no malicious code detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, notes the `exec()` pattern and the unusual URL, but no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Comments:** Same conclusion.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the `exec()` as a security risk, with a higher risk score (0.4), but still no malware detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.4\n- **Comments:** Recognizes the `exec()` as a security concern but not malware.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:**  \n  All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior. The only recurring concern is the use of `exec()` to load version info, which is a known pattern but can be risky if the version file is compromised.\n\n- **Malware Evaluation:**  \n  None of the reports detect malicious code or behaviors. The malware score should remain at **0**.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  No obfuscation is present; all reports agree on this.\n\n- **Security Risk & Scores:**  \n  The main difference is the risk score, which varies from 0.1 to 0.4. Given that `exec()` can execute arbitrary code if the version file is malicious, the risk is non-negligible but not necessarily malicious.\n\n  - The use of `exec()` is a common pattern but should be flagged as a security concern, especially if the source of `__version__.py` cannot be guaranteed to be safe.\n  - The project URL pointing to a YouTube video is unconventional but not malicious.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Keep at **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:**  \n  - Given the repeated concerns about `exec()`, a moderate risk score around **0.3** seems appropriate, reflecting the potential security concern but no active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0.3** |\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical setup script with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of `exec()` to load version info, which should be reviewed to ensure the version file is trusted. The overall security posture is low risk but warrants caution regarding the `exec()` pattern.",
