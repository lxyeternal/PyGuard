  "purpose": "This script is designed to set up a Python package, gather metadata, and include necessary files for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from '__version__.py', reading README.md, globbing for directories and files in 'tls_client/dependencies/'.",
  "sinks": "exec() on dynamically read version file content, which could execute arbitrary code if the file is malicious.",
  "flows": "Reading '__version__.py' and executing its content via exec(), then using that data for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from a file, which could be dangerous if the file is tampered with or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures with package metadata and dependencies. The primary concern is the use of exec() to parse '__version__.py', which could execute malicious code if the file is compromised. The rest of the script mainly reads files and prepares data for package distribution. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or other malicious behaviors are present. The globbing of dependencies seems standard for including additional package data.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs package setup tasks with a notable security risk due to the use of exec() on an external file. If the version file is trusted and properly controlled, the risk is minimal. Otherwise, this could be exploited to execute malicious code during installation.",
