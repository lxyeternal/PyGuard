  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for TLS client errors",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified",
  "anomalies": "Simple class definition, no anomalies or suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of IOError named TLSClientExeption (note the misspelling). It contains only a docstring and no executable code or data handling. There are no inputs, no data processing, no security-sensitive operations, and no malicious patterns. The misspelling of 'Exception' could be a typo but does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign class definition intended to handle TLS client errors. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are present.",
