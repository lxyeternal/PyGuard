  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for TLS client errors",
  "sources": "Class declaration; no input or data reading involved",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow; class is only a declaration with a typo",
  "anomalies": "Typo in class name: 'TLSClientExeption' instead of 'TLSClientException'",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from IOError with only a docstring. The main anomaly is the misspelling of 'Exception' as 'Exeption'. No data flows, input/output, or security-sensitive operations are present. The typo is likely accidental and benign. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The code is trivial and safe, with the typo being the only concern, which does not impact security. The high confidence scores reflect certainty of benign intent, but the risk score should be lowered to reflect minimal security concern.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, containing only a typo in the class name. It does not pose any security risk or malicious activity. The current high confidence scores are appropriate, but the overall security risk should be set low. The typo should be corrected for clarity, but no security action is necessary.",
