  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for TLS client errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as there are no data sources.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in class name ('TLSClientExeption' likely intended as 'TLSClientException'). The class only inherits from IOError and contains a docstring, with no additional code or functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from IOError, intended for TLS client errors. The class is very simple, with a typo in its name. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. There are no data flows, no input/output operations, and no obfuscated or complex code structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign class definition with a typographical error. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
