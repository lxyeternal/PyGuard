  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for TLS client errors",
  "sources": "No external input sources; class definition does not read data or input",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output occurs",
  "flows": "No data flow as this is only a class declaration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class extension of IOError with a descriptive docstring",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'TLSClientExeption' inheriting from IOError, intended for TLS client error handling. The class is poorly named due to a likely typo ('Exeption' instead of 'Exception'), but this is a benign issue and does not imply malicious behavior. The code does not perform any input/output operations, data processing, or contain any suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. It is a simple class declaration with no security risks or malware indications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign class definition intended for error handling related to TLS clients. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The only notable aspect is a typographical error in the class name, which is unlikely to be malicious.",
