  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for TLS client errors",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Simple class definition with a typo in the class name ('TLSClientExeption' instead of 'TLSClientException') which might indicate obfuscation or a mistake, but not malicious by itself",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from IOError, intended for TLS client errors. The class is minimal and contains only a docstring. The typo in the class name does not inherently suggest malicious intent but could be a mistake or an attempt at obfuscation. There are no suspicious imports, data handling, or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward class definition for an exception, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable aspect is the typo in the class name, which is unlikely to be malicious but should be corrected for clarity.",
