  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for errors related to a TLS client.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not handle or process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The class name 'TLSClientExeption' appears to be a misspelling of 'TLSClientException', which could be accidental or suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of IOError intended to represent TLS client errors. The class contains only a docstring and no functional logic. The misspelling of 'Exception' as 'Exeption' is notable; if intentional, it could be an obfuscation or a typo. Otherwise, it appears as a simple typo with no malicious intent. No input handling, data processing, or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple class definition with no malicious behavior or security issues. The only concern is the misspelling of 'Exception', which seems benign but warrants attention in context.",
