  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions to manage HTTP cookies, mimicking urllib request/response behaviors, with a focus on cookie extraction, storage, and manipulation.",
  "sources": "Reading request_url, request_headers in MockRequest; response_headers in extract_cookies_to_jar; cookie data in RequestsCookieJar methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential cookie manipulation in set, __setitem__, update methods; cookie extraction in extract_cookies_to_jar.",
  "flows": "request_url and request_headers -> MockRequest -> extract_cookies_to_jar -> merge_cookies -> cookiejar operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual obfuscation detected. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements cookie management classes and functions, closely resembling standard cookie handling behavior. No suspicious external communications or malicious data handling are present. It appears to be a legitimate cookie utility module. All cookie manipulations are within expected boundaries; no anomalous code, hidden behaviors, or potential malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a cookie management utility, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign implementation aligned with cookie handling best practices.",
