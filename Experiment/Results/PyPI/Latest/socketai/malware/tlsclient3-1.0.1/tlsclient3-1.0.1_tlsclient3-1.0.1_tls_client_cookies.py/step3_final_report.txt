  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for managing HTTP cookies, including creation, extraction, merging, and storage, mimicking urllib behaviors and ensuring compatibility with requests.",
  "sources": "Request URL, request headers, response headers, cookie jar",
  "sinks": "Cookie storage and retrieval within the cookie jar, cookie extraction from response headers",
  "flows": "Request headers and URL are used to create MockRequest; response headers are parsed to extract cookies into the jar; cookies are stored, retrieved, or merged within the cookie jar",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie management, including mock classes for requests and responses, cookie jar operations, and cookie extraction functions. It does not perform any network activity beyond cookie handling, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious code. The functions and classes follow typical patterns for cookie handling, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent. The security implications are minimal, primarily related to proper handling of untrusted data, but no vulnerabilities are evident in this isolated module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cookie management utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
