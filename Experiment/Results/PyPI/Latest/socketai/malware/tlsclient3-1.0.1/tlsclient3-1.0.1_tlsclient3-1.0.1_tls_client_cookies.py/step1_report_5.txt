{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions to handle HTTP cookies, mimicking parts of urllib and requests cookie handling, including cookie storage, retrieval, merging, and extraction from HTTP responses.",
  "sources": "Input sources include request_url and request_headers in extract_cookies_to_jar(), as well as response_headers. Data is read from headers, URL parsing, and cookie objects.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include methods that set or modify cookies, such as set(), set_cookie(), update(), and remove_cookie_by_name(), which could alter or delete cookies based on input data.",
  "flows": "Cookies are created from headers in extract_cookies_to_jar(), merged into cookie jars, and manipulated via get/set methods. Data flows from HTTP response headers to cookie jar objects, with possible modification via set() or delete functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation present. The code uses standard libraries and patterns consistent with cookie management. No hidden or malicious behavior detected. The code does include detailed cookie handling, but nothing suspicious or malicious is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation of cookie management, including classes that extend CookieJar, functions to create, merge, and delete cookies, and a method to extract cookies from HTTP response headers. It appears to be an adaptation of requests library components, focusing on handling cookies securely and compatibly. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or unauthorized system access. The functions and classes operate on data structures and APIs typical for cookie handling, with no suspicious external network calls or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of cookie management for HTTP requests and responses. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected. It is a standard library-like code for handling cookies, with no indications of malware or supply chain attacks.",
