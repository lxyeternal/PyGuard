  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a cookie management utility with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is standard, mimicking cookie handling behavior, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The reasoning is sound; no suspicious behaviors or obfuscation are present.\n- The security risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable, considering potential misuses in untrusted contexts but no explicit vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, standard cookie handling with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis correctly identifies the code as standard, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The potential concern about untrusted data is valid but not indicative of actual malicious intent.\n- The security risk score is consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard cookie management, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is typical for cookie handling, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The reasoning is thorough; no external communications or malicious patterns.\n- The security risk score remains appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's evaluation is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard cookie handling, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is a conventional implementation, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors.\n- The reasoning is consistent; no malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- The security risk score aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment and scoring are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard cookie management, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is typical for cookie handling, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The reasoning is sound; no external network activity or obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, matching the clear, straightforward implementation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Uniformly 0.2, reflecting a low but non-zero potential for misuse in untrusted contexts, which is reasonable for cookie handling code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behaviors detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent and standard.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — typical for cookie management code that could be misused if combined with untrusted data, but no direct vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and appropriately scored. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a standard, benign cookie management utility.  \n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are evident.  \n- The scoring accurately reflects the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain current scores and conclusions.",
