  "purpose": "Obfuscated payload decoding and execution, likely malicious.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string decoded via b64decode, then character-wise XOR with 3, followed by exec() on the result.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing the decoded and XOR-processed code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "Source: base64 string -> XOR decryption -> exec() sink, with initial sleep delay to evade detection.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation through base64 encoding, XOR cipher, and delayed execution; use of exec() on dynamically decoded data; initial sleep delay.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with benign package metadata, then introduces a 5-second sleep. The core suspicious part is the decoding process: a long base64 string is decoded, then each character is XORed with 3, transforming it into executable code, which is then run via exec(). The heavy obfuscation and dynamic execution pattern are classic indicators of malicious intent, often used to conceal payloads such as backdoors, malware, or sabotage scripts. The high obfuscation score (around 0.9), malware score (around 0.9), and security risk score (around 0.9) are justified given these techniques. The code's structure suggests an attempt to hide malicious behavior, and the use of exec() on decoded data is a significant security concern. Without analyzing the decoded payload directly, we cannot confirm the specific malicious actions, but the techniques employed strongly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits heavy obfuscation, delayed execution, and dynamic code execution via exec() on a decoded payload, all of which are characteristic of malicious scripts. The high scores assigned are justified and indicate a high probability of malicious behavior. It should be treated as a high-risk, potentially malicious dependency, and further static or dynamic analysis of the decoded payload is recommended in a controlled environment.",
