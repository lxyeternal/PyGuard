{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata for a Python package and includes obfuscated code that executes after a delay, possibly to evade detection or analysis.",
  "sources": "Input source is from the obfuscated base64-encoded string decoded at runtime, and the initial sleep introduces delay before execution.",
  "sinks": "The decoded code is executed via exec(), which is a sink for untrusted data. It contains dynamically decoded and executed code, potentially malicious.",
  "flows": "The code flow starts with a sleep, then decodes a base64 string, performs XOR transformations, and executes the result via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation with base64 and XOR, delayed execution with sleep, and dynamic execution via exec() are suspicious behaviors indicating an attempt to conceal malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script delays execution intentionally with sleep, then decodes a base64 string, which is further processed with an XOR transformation. The resultant string is executed with exec(), which could execute arbitrary code. The code’s structure, including heavy obfuscation, delayed execution, and runtime decoding, strongly suggests malicious intent or sabotage. The initial comments and metadata are benign, but the core dynamic code execution is a significant anomaly.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscation, delayed execution, and dynamic eval of a decoded payload, which are common tactics in malicious scripts. While the exact decoded content cannot be fully verified without executing, the structure and behaviors strongly indicate malicious intent.",
