  "conclusion": "The code exhibits heavy obfuscation, delayed execution, and dynamic code execution via exec() on a decoded payload, all of which are characteristic of malicious scripts. The high scores assigned are justified and indicate a high probability of malicious behavior. It should be treated as a high-risk, potentially malicious dependency, and further static or dynamic analysis of the decoded payload is recommended in a controlled environment."
