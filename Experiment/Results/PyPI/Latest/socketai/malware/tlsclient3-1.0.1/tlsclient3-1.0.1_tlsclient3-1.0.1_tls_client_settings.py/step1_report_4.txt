  "purpose": "Defines a type alias for client identifiers corresponding to various browsers and mobile platforms.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading occurs in this code).",
  "sinks": "None (no data outputs or untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from source to sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, using type aliasing with literals for a fixed set of strings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' and 'TypeAlias' from 'typing_extensions' and declares a type alias 'ClientIdentifiers' as a Literal type containing numerous string constants representing different browser and platform identifiers. The list appears to be a static enumeration without any dynamic or obfuscated code. There are no data inputs, external calls, or dynamic executions. The code is purely declarative, serving as a type hint for code that will use 'ClientIdentifiers'. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static type alias declaration for client identifiers. It contains no suspicious behavior, no external data handling, nor any malicious code. It appears to be a standard approach to defining a fixed set of string literals for type safety in a larger project.",
