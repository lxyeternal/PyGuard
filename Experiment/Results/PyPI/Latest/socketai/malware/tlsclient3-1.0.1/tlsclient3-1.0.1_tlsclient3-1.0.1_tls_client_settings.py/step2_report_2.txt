  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a static type alias declaration using `Literal` from `typing_extensions`, listing many string literals representing client identifiers.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, or runtime behavior is present.\n- The code is purely declarative, intended for type checking and code clarity.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The reported scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are all zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is a straightforward type alias declaration with no evidence of issues.\n- No input sources, data flows, or runtime behaviors that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent.\n- The code's purpose is clear, and the implementation is correct for its intent.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 is appropriate; no security concerns.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- Since the code is static, non-executable, and only defines a set of string literals for type safety, the risk scores should remain at zero.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign and serves a purely type annotation purpose.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, non-malicious type alias declaration with no security risks or obfuscation. The current scores are justified and should remain as-is.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scoring—no changes needed. The code poses no security threat, and the scores correctly reflect its benign nature.",
