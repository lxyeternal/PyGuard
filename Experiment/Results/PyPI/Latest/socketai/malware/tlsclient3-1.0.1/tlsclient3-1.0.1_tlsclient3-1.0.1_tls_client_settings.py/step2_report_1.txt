  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a static type alias declaration using `Literal` and `TypeAlias` from `typing_extensions`. The code contains only string literals representing client identifiers and does not involve any dynamic behavior, input handling, or external data.  \n   **Conclusion**: No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note that the code is a straightforward static type alias with no malicious or suspicious elements. No logical errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0  \n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   - `obfuscated`: 0  \n   - `confidence`: 1  \n   \n   These scores are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely a static type alias with no runtime behavior, no security risk exists. Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is correctly assigned as 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a static type alias.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores and Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a benign, static type alias declaration intended for type safety and clarity. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0  \n\nThis code is standard, safe, and has no security implications. No further action or concern is warranted.",
