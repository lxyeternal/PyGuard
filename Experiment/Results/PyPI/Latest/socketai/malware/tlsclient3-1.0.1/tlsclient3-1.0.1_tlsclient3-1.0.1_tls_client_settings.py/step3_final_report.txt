  "purpose": "Define a static set of client identifier strings for type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "No runtime data sources; static string literals used for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static type alias with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static declaration with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type extension tools and declares a static type alias 'ClientIdentifiers' as a union of string literals representing various browsers and platforms. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, or executable logic. The code is purely declarative, intended for type checking, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or runtime behaviors. All reports correctly identify its benign, static nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the context. There are no indications of security risks or malicious intent. The code is standard, safe, and serves a clear purpose for type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static type alias declaration with no malicious or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
