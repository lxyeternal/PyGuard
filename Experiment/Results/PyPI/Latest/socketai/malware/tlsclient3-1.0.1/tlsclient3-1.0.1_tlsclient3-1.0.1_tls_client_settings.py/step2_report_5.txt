  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code is a static type alias declaration using `Literal` for a set of string constants.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, input handling, or runtime code.\n- The code is straightforward and static, serving as a type hint for type checkers.\n\n**2. Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative with no malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The reasoning is consistent: static, safe, and intended for type safety.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Issues:**\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence is high (1), which is justified given the static nature and lack of suspicious content.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- None of the reports justify a risk higher than 0.5, and given the static, benign nature, this is correct.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n\n**5. Malware Score Reflection:**\n- Since there's no malicious activity, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a static type alias.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0**  \n\nThe code is a standard, benign type alias declaration with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a simple static type alias for client identifiers, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.  \n- Confirm that this static declaration is used for type safety and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.",
