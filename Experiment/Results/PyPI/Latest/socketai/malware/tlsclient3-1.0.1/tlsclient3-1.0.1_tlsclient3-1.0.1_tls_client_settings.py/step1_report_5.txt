{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'ClientIdentifiers' for a fixed set of string literals representing various client or browser identifiers.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code is static and defines a type alias with hardcoded string literals.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; the code solely defines a type alias.",
  "flows": "No data flow as the code is only a type alias definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' and 'TypeAlias' from 'typing_extensions' to define a type alias consisting of specific string literals. These literals appear to represent different versions and types of browsers, mobile clients, and possibly custom client identifiers. The literals are explicitly enumerated, and there are no dynamic or user-input components, external data, or executable code that could be malicious. The code serves a static purpose for type hinting and does not perform any operations or data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign type alias definition for client identifiers. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a standard practice for maintaining type safety in Python projects.",
