  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'ClientIdentifiers' as a literal union of various browser and mobile client strings for type checking.",
  "sources": "The code itself, specifically the string literals within the Literal[] declaration.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle external input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or external data handling; purely a static type alias definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed. The code consists solely of type alias and string literals.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' and 'TypeAlias' from 'typing_extensions', then defines a type alias 'ClientIdentifiers' as a union of specific string literals representing various client identifiers. There is no dynamic code execution, no external input handling, and no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. The purpose appears to be for type safety and code clarity within a larger codebase. No security issues, malware, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static type alias definition for client identifier strings, with no malicious intent or security risks present.",
