{
  "purpose": "Defines a type alias 'ClientIdentifiers' as a literal set of strings representing various client identifiers for different browsers and platforms.",
  "sources": "No dynamic input sources; the code only declares a type alias with static string literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data or user input; static declaration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing; purely type alias declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present; the code is straightforward type alias declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' and 'TypeAlias' from 'typing_extensions', then defines 'ClientIdentifiers' as a literal type consisting of many string literals representing browser and platform identifiers. There are no input sources, data flows, or runtime behaviors involved. It appears to be a static type definition for type checking purposes. No code execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type alias declaration for use in type annotations, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
