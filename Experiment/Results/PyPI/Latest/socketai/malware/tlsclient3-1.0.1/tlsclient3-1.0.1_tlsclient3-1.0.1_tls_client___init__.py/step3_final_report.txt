{
  "purpose": "This code snippet primarily consists of comments crediting external projects and a single import statement from a local module, likely part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .sessions import Session' indicates data or control flow from a local module named 'sessions'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects, as no functions or data processing are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this snippet; the import suggests potential use elsewhere but does not imply malicious flow here.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only comments and a straightforward import, with no obfuscation, secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is benign, consisting solely of attribution comments and a simple import statement. There is no executable logic, data handling, network activity, or suspicious behavior. The comments are standard and do not include obfuscation or secrets. The import is from a local module, which is typical in package structures. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal code and comments do not pose any security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
