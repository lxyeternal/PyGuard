  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No. The code is just comments and an import statement. No executable or data-processing code.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None. The report correctly identifies the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Overall assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No. Similar to Report 1, it's just comments and an import.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None. The report correctly notes the absence of suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is minimal (0.1). The rationale aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or obfuscation detected.\n- **Overall assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No. Comments and import only.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None. The report accurately states the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0. The assessment is consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Overall assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No. Again, only comments and an import.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None. The report's conclusion is correct.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, matching the benign analysis.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Overall assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No. Same pattern.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None. The report correctly notes the lack of malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Zero for malware and obfuscated, no security risk.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely structural/documentational.\n- **Overall assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Systematic Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, as expected, given the benign nature.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (since the code is part of a package that could be used maliciously if misused, but there's no evidence here)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code fragment is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe and the assessments are justified.",
