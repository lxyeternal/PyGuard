  "purpose": "Load a platform-specific shared library and expose its functions for use in Python code.",
  "sources": "Reading system platform and architecture info, constructing filename, loading shared library via ctypes.",
  "sinks": "Functions 'request', 'freeMemory', 'destroySession' invoked with data that could originate from untrusted sources, but this is outside the scope of this code.",
  "flows": "System info → filename construction → ctypes load library → expose functions → external code calls functions with data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard platform detection, constructs the correct filename for the shared library, loads it via ctypes, and sets argument and return types for three functions. It does not contain malicious logic or obfuscation. The security concern primarily hinges on the trustworthiness of the external shared library, which is outside the code's scope. No errors or flaws are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0.2, reflecting external dependency trust issues. The code is benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard platform-dependent shared library loader with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The primary security concern is external library integrity, not the code itself. Scores are appropriate and justified.",
