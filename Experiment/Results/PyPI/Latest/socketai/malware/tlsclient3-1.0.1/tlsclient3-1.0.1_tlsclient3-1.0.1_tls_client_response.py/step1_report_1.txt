  "purpose": "Define a Response class for handling HTTP responses, including parsing JSON and managing response content, headers, cookies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Input data for build_response function: res (dict/list) containing target, status, headers, body; res_cookies (RequestsCookieJar).",
  "sinks": "json.loads(self.text) in json() method, potential parsing of untrusted data; self.text is directly assigned from external input in build_response.",
  "flows": "build_response assigns response properties from external data; self.text is assigned from res['body'] which could be untrusted; json() parses this text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to build and handle HTTP responses, including parsing JSON and managing headers and cookies. It receives external data (res) and cookies, then constructs a Response object. The json() method relies on self.text, which is set from external data, but there's no evidence of malicious input handling or dangerous code execution. The code does not perform any network connections, data leaks, or other malicious activities. The use of json.loads on untrusted input is standard for response parsing, but should be used cautiously in real applications. Overall, the code is straightforward and does not contain any malicious behaviors or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a utility for handling HTTP responses. No malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. The only potential concern is parsing untrusted JSON data, which is typical in response handling but warrants cautious use. Overall, low security risk and no malware detected.",
