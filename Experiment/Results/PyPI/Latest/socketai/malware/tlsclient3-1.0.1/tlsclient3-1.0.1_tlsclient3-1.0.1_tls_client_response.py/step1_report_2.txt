  "purpose": "Define an HTTP Response object and helper function to build it from a dictionary and cookies.",
  "sources": "Input data from the 'res' dictionary parameter in build_response() and cookie jar from cookiejar_from_dict().",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows directly into sensitive operations like system commands, network connections, or file operations. The code primarily processes and stores data in response objects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input dictionary 'res' and cookies into the Response object attributes. No untrusted data is used in critical security-sensitive functions beyond simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward without unusual or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. The response body is directly assigned from input without validation, which is typical for response parsing, but no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Response class that models HTTP responses with methods for JSON parsing and content retrieval. The build_response() function constructs a Response object from input data, setting URL, status code, headers, cookies, and body content. No data is used in insecure ways; no external commands, network calls, or sensitive data handling are present. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious data leakage. The code simply maps provided input data into a response structure, which is common in HTTP client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an HTTP response object with a helper for constructing it from a dictionary. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It does not process untrusted data in unsafe ways beyond normal data handling. Overall, the code appears benign.",
