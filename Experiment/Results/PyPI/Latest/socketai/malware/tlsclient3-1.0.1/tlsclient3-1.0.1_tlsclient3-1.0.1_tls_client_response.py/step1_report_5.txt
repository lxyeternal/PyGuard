{
  "purpose": "Defines a Response class and a helper function to build Response objects from data, simulating HTTP response handling.",
  "sources": "Input data for build_response function (res dict and res_cookies), response.text (from external sources), json.loads (parsing response body).",
  "sinks": "json.loads on self.text, which could process untrusted input; assignment of cookies and headers.",
  "flows": "Response object is constructed from external input; response.text is parsed with json.loads; response.content joins chunks from iter_content (not defined here).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs HTTP response objects, parses JSON, and manages response data and cookies. It accepts external input (res dict, cookies) and processes response text. No evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. Functions and class methods perform standard tasks related to HTTP response handling. No suspicious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present. The use of json.loads on response text assumes trusted input; however, this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured HTTP response handler with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of an HTTP response object and builder function. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the analysis. It appears safe and typical for such functionality.",
