{
  "purpose": "Defines a Response class for handling HTTP responses and a builder function for constructing Response objects from dictionary data and cookies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'res' dictionary parameter in 'build_response' and potentially untrusted response body 'res['body']'. It also reads cookie data from 'res_cookies'.",
  "sinks": "The 'json()' method parses 'self.text' into JSON, which could be risky if 'self.text' contains malicious JSON. The 'content' property reads 'self.iter_content', which is not defined here, but could involve network streams or other data sources. No explicit sinks like network or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input 'res' dictionary into the Response object's attributes ('url', 'status_code', 'headers', 'text', 'cookies', '_content'). The 'json()' method converts 'self.text' into a Python object, which can be unsafe if 'self.text' is maliciously crafted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be straightforward response handling with no obfuscated or suspicious code structures. Use of 'b\"\".join(self.iter_content(...))' could be suspicious if 'iter_content' is malicious, but its implementation is not provided here.",
  "analysis": "The code creates an HTTP Response object with standard attributes and a builder function that populates these attributes from a dictionary input. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The 'json()' method simply parses JSON text without sanitization, which is typical but should be used cautiously. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The 'build_response' function and 'Response' class are designed for response handling, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for handling HTTP responses, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It processes response data safely and in accordance with common practices. No anomalies or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
