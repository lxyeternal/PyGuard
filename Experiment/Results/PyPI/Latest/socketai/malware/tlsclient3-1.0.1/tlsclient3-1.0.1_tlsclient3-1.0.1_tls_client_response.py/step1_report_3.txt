{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Response class to encapsulate HTTP response data and a function to build such Response objects from given data structures, primarily for processing HTTP responses within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'res' dictionary containing response metadata and the 'res_cookies' RequestsCookieJar object; response body text is set directly from 'res'.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if response.text or response._content are improperly handled or exposed. No direct sink for untrusted input manipulation is evident.",
  "flows": "The build_response function maps data from the input 'res' dictionary and cookie jar into the Response object, setting URL, status, headers, cookies, and body content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code uses standard patterns for HTTP response handling.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a Response object by populating fields from an input dictionary and cookie jar. It correctly processes headers, cookies, and response content. No unsafe data handling or external code execution observed. The 'json' method safely parses JSON from the response body. The class properties and methods are typical for HTTP response management. No signs of malicious intent or security issues identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation for handling HTTP responses within an application, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It processes input data safely and in a conventional manner.",
