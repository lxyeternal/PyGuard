  "purpose": "Minimal setup script importing setuptools and invoking setup() with no arguments.",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools; invocation of setup() with no parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; setup() is called without arguments, no external data is involved.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of arguments in setup(), no configuration or metadata provided, but this is standard for minimal setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, minimal setup script used in Python packaging. It imports setup from setuptools and calls setup() with no arguments, which is a common pattern for simple or placeholder setup files. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious behaviors such as network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions strongly suggest benign intent. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or security issues. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign minimal setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scoring should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
