  "purpose": "The code is used to configure and initiate the setup process for a Python package distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only calls the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The code simply executes setup(), which is a standard package configuration call, with no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimalistic and standard; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls the setup() function without any arguments. This is a common pattern in Python packaging, often found in setup.py files. It does not include any malicious code, external data handling, or suspicious logic. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. It performs a typical package setup with no indicators of malicious behavior.",
