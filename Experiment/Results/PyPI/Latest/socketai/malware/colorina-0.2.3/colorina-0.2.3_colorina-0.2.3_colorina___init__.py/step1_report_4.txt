{
  "purpose": "The script collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data, then sends this data to multiple external webhooks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, filesystem files (leveldb, JSON, sqlite), and subprocess commands (system UUID). The data read includes user environment, browser storage, and Minecraft account files.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to external URLs (decoded from base64 strings). This acts as a data exfiltration mechanism.",
  "flows": "Sources such as filesystem files, environment variables, and system commands feed data into collection functions. Collected data then flows into send_to_webhook() which transmits data to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "The code decodes multiple base64-encoded URLs, uses regex to extract Discord tokens, reads potentially sensitive browser data (passwords), and collects system identifiers, all without user consent. It also sends data to multiple external webhooks, indicating potentially malicious exfiltration. The use of broad exception handling can mask errors, and reading encrypted passwords from the browser database without decryption is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by decoding hardcoded base64 URLs, indicating intent to obfuscate webhook targets. It collects system info (username, hostname, HWID, IP), Discord tokens from leveldb files, and browser passwords from Chrome's login database, which may contain sensitive data. It also attempts to read Minecraft account data from known paths. All collected data is then sent to external webhooks via POST requests. The functions are straightforward but collect private information, possibly for malicious purposes. No signs of backdoors or malicious code execution are present, but the focus on exfiltration and credential harvesting suggests malicious intent. The code structure and obfuscation level are minimal but the intent is privacy-infringing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to collect sensitive user information—system data, Discord tokens, browser passwords, Minecraft accounts—and transmit it to external servers without user consent. It exhibits typical traits of credential harvesting and data exfiltration scripts, indicating malicious intent. No malware signatures like system damage or backdoors are present, but its purpose aligns with privacy invasion and data theft.",
