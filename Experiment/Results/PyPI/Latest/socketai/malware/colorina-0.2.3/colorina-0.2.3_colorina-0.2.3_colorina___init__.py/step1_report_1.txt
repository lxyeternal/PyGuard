    "Use of subprocess to retrieve hardware UUID, which could be used for tracking",
    "The script lacks any user prompt or consent, indicating possible malicious intent"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code appears designed to harvest sensitive user data, including system details, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account info, then exfiltrate this data via multiple webhooks. It decodes hardcoded base64 URLs for webhooks, uses system commands to gather hardware UUIDs, and accesses local files containing potentially confidential data. The multiple data collection vectors and data exfiltration strongly suggest malicious intent. The script does not perform any benign or user-initiated actions, and the data transmission to external URLs is indicative of a malicious supply chain or backdoor activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and exfiltrating sensitive user information without consent. It employs techniques like base64 encoding for URLs to evade detection and gathers data that could be used for malicious purposes, such as identity theft or unauthorized system access.",
