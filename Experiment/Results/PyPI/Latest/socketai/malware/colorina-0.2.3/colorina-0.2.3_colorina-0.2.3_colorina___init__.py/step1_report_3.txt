{
  "purpose": "The script collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data, then sends this data to specified webhooks.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, system commands (via subprocess), files from user directories, and online API calls (ipify).",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to external URLs (decoded URLs), which can transmit sensitive information without user consent.",
  "flows": "System info, tokens, passwords, and accounts are gathered from sources and directly sent to external webhooks without validation or user consent.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded URLs for obfuscation; collecting sensitive data such as passwords and tokens; sending data without encryption; access to system identifiers and user info; extensive use of try-except blocks that suppress errors; lack of user consent indication.",
  "analysis": "The code performs extensive data collection including system details, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts. It decodes and sends this data to multiple external webhooks, which is suspicious and indicative of data exfiltration. The URL obfuscation via base64 hints at an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code does not appear to perform any benign or necessary function; instead, it targets sensitive user data for potential malicious use. The code structure is straightforward but focused on stealthy data harvesting. There are no signs of obfuscation beyond URL encoding, no malicious system modifications, and no code that executes harmful payloads on the system itself. Overall, it resembles typical info-stealing malware with data exfiltration, with high malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to stealthily collect and transmit sensitive user data, including system info, Discord tokens, passwords, and account details, to external webhooks. Its structure and behavior suggest malicious intent, primarily data exfiltration for unauthorized purposes.",
