{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts, then exfiltrates this data via multiple encoded webhooks.",
  "sources": "Filesystem files (leveldb, Chrome Login Data, Minecraft configs), environment variables, system commands, user input (via os.getlogin()), and hardcoded base64 URLs.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() calls to decoded URLs, writing to local files, subprocess commands, and reading sensitive data from local databases and configs.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from filesystem and system info sources, then encoded or formatted, and finally sent via HTTP POST requests to the decoded webhook URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for URLs as a form of obfuscation; broad try-except blocks masking errors; collection of sensitive data without user consent; no decryption of Chrome passwords; multiple exfiltration points.",
  "analysis": "The script decodes multiple base64-encoded URLs at runtime, indicating an attempt to hide webhook endpoints. It collects system info via system commands and environment variables, extracts Discord tokens from leveldb files, reads Chrome's 'Login Data' database without decrypting passwords, and searches for Minecraft account configs. All data is formatted and sent to external servers via requests.post(). The code employs broad exception handling, which can mask errors but is typical in malicious scripts. The URL obfuscation is minimal but present, and the data collection targets sensitive information, indicating malicious intent. No destructive payloads or backdoors are evident beyond data theft. The overall behavior aligns with typical info-stealer malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, designed for extensive data exfiltration including system info, credentials, and tokens, using URL obfuscation to hide webhook endpoints. It lacks user consent and employs multiple vectors for data collection. The behavior justifies high malware and security risk scores. Obfuscation is minimal but present. Overall, it should be considered a serious security threat.",
