{
  "purpose": "The script collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data, then sends this information to external URLs via webhooks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, filesystem (leveldb files, JSON configs, login database), subprocess output, and network requests to retrieve public IP and send data.",
  "sinks": "Network requests via requests.post to external URLs; reading potentially sensitive files (Discord, browser, Minecraft data); subprocess execution to get system UUID; reading encrypted passwords from database.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables, filesystem, and subprocess are aggregated and then sent via multiple HTTP POST requests to decoded URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Decoding multiple base64-encoded URLs that lead to external servers; collecting Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts without user consent; sending all collected data to multiple external webhook URLs; execution of system commands for hardware ID; no validation or user prompts.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to harvest sensitive user data including system info, Discord tokens, saved browser passwords, and Minecraft account info. It decodes hardcoded base64 URLs, then sends the collected data to these URLs via HTTP POST requests, effectively exfiltrating data. The use of broad filesystem access, pattern matching for tokens, and execution of system commands indicate malicious intent. The script does not contain any obfuscation but performs actions typical of malware focused on data theft. No explicit backdoors or system damage routines are present, but its data collection and exfiltration behavior are suspicious and unauthorized.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent aimed at data exfiltration without user consent. It harvests sensitive information from various sources and transmits it to external servers. The behavior aligns with typical info-stealing malware, and its actions pose a security risk. The code should be considered highly malicious with a security risk score near the upper range.",
