{
  "purpose": "The script collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data, then sends this data to multiple URLs via webhooks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, file system paths for Discord, Chrome, Brave, Edge, Minecraft configs, and external IP API.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to external URLs via HTTP POST requests with potential exposure of sensitive data, including system info, tokens, passwords, and account details.",
  "flows": "The code gathers data from various sources and flows it into the send_to_webhook function, which posts data to decoded URLs, potentially exfiltrating data.",
  "anomalies": "The code decodes multiple base64-encoded URLs used for data exfiltration. It collects sensitive data such as Discord tokens, browser passwords (encrypted), system info, and Minecraft accounts. The passwords are not decrypted, only base64-encoded. The script's purpose aligns with data harvesting and exfiltration, which is suspicious. No obfuscation or unusual language features detected beyond standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The script performs multiple potentially malicious activities: it extracts Discord tokens from leveldb files, captures system info including hardware UUID and public IP, attempts to access and encode browser passwords, and reads Minecraft account data from known configuration paths. It then sends all collected data to several external URLs decoded from base64, indicating possible data exfiltration. The functions involved are straightforward but focused on collecting and transmitting sensitive information without user consent. No signs of obfuscated code or hidden backdoors, but the purpose and behavior are clearly malicious and privacy-invasive.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a data-stealing agent, exfiltrating sensitive user data to remote servers via webhooks. It demonstrates malicious intent consistent with spyware or malware designed to harvest and transmit private information without user consent. The use of encoded URLs and multiple exfiltration points increases suspicion.",
