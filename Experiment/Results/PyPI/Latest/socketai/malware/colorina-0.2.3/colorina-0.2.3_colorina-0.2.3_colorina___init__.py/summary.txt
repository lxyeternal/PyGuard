  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, designed for extensive data exfiltration including system info, credentials, and tokens, using URL obfuscation to hide webhook endpoints. It lacks user consent and employs multiple vectors for data collection. The behavior justifies high malware and security risk scores. Obfuscation is minimal but present. Overall, it should be considered a serious security threat."
