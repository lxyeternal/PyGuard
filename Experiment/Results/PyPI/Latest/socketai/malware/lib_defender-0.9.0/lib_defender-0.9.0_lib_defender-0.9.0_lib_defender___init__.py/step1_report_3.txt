{
  "purpose": "Import main_function from the local core module, likely to execute or expose core functionality of the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from a local module '.core'. No external data sources or inputs are directly read in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points are present in this fragment; it only contains an import statement.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows are present in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, just an import statement with relative import syntax. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function called 'main_function' from a local module named 'core'. This is a typical pattern for modular Python code. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as embedded backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious operations. As this is only an import statement, it provides no execution or data flow evidence. No obfuscation or malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity. It does not perform any operations, data handling, or network communication on its own. It is unlikely to pose any security risk based solely on this fragment.",
