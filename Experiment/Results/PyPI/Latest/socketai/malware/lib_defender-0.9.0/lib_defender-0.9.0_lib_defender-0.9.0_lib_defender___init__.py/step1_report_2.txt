{
  "purpose": "The code imports a main_function from a local core module, likely used to execute core application logic.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.core)",
  "sinks": "None present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow is visible beyond the import statement",
  "anomalies": "Lack of context makes it impossible to determine if core contains malicious code; the snippet itself is minimal",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a single import statement, which by itself does not perform any operations. It imports main_function from a local module named core. Without additional code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or unusual activity. The presence of a local import is common in modular Python projects and does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious code execution, data handling, or external communication occurs here.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this minimal snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a simple import statement typical in Python projects. Additional context would be needed for a comprehensive assessment.",
