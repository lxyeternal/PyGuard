  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code is just an import statement with no suspicious activity.\n- The confidence score is 0.8, which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n- Malware score is 0, which aligns with the assessment.\n- Security risk is 0.1, reflecting very low risk.\n- No issues found; the reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also states that the code is a simple import with no malicious signs.\n- Confidence is 0.6, slightly lower but acceptable due to limited context.\n- Malware score is 0, consistent.\n- Security risk is 0.2, still very low.\n- No flaws or errors in reasoning.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing that it's a standard import.\n- Confidence is 0.8, appropriate.\n- Malware score is 0, matching the minimal code.\n- Security risk is 0, as expected.\n- The reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Adds that the imported function might be invoked later, but this is speculative.\n- Confidence is 1, possibly overestimating given no further code.\n- Malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n- Security risk is 0.\n- The report reasonably notes that no malicious activity is evident in this snippet.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Again, confirms the benign nature of the import.\n- Confidence is 1, which is appropriate.\n- Malware score is 0.\n- Security risk is 0.\n- The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None detected. All reports are consistent and logical.\n- **Scores review:** The malware scores are all 0, which is justified. The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the minimal code.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code is just an import statement with no execution or data flow.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence levels:** Mostly reasonable; some are at 1, which is acceptable given the simplicity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The malware scores should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are correctly at 0.\n- Security risk scores are appropriately low, given the context.\n\n### Overall:\n- **Estimated malware score:** 0\n- **Estimated obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Estimated security risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, given the minimal code and no suspicious activity)\n\n**In conclusion,** the reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.",
