  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a simple import statement.\n- No suspicious activity, data flow, or obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0.1 — minimal, but perhaps slightly overestimating risk for such a benign snippet.\n- Confidence: 0.8 — high, given the minimal code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the simplicity and benign nature.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0.2 — still very low, but perhaps slightly overestimating risk.\n- Confidence: 0.6 — moderate, due to limited context.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, a straightforward import statement.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Malware score: 0 — consistent.\n- Security risk: 0 — no apparent risk.\n- Confidence: 0.8 — high.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly more speculative, mentions potential execution of 'main_function' later, but notes that it's not shown.\n- No actual malicious activity or code flow in this snippet.\n- Malware score: 0 — correct.\n- Security risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- Confidence: 1 — very confident in benign nature.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to previous, confirms the benign, standard import.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code or indicators:** None of the reports identify any signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n- **Scores for malware:** All are 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1 or 0.2). Given the minimal code, these could be considered marginally overestimated. However, since the code is part of a larger system, a small risk score can be justified as a conservative measure.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security risk:** Given the simplicity, a score of 0 or very close to 0 would be more appropriate. Slightly higher scores (0.1 or 0.2) are acceptable if the context considers the potential for future malicious code in the module, but based solely on this snippet, 0 is more justified.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the benign nature of the code.\n- The scores are reasonable, though perhaps slightly conservative in security risk for such a minimal snippet.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious indicators.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — based solely on this snippet, the security risk is negligible.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign import statement with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scoring in the reports aligns well with this assessment.",
