{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'main_function' from a local module named 'core'. It appears to serve as an entry point or a part of a larger application, likely executing the imported function later in the script.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'core', which may involve reading code, data files, or environment variables within that module.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'main_function' (not shown), which could be a sink if it involves untrusted input handling or network operations, but is not present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import from 'core' as source; any subsequent invocation of 'main_function' (not shown) would be the flow point. No actual execution or data flow occurs in this snippet alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and structurally normal; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior evident in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a function from a local module. There are no suspicious operations, data flows, or embedded malicious code. The import itself is standard practice. Without additional context or further code execution, no malicious behavior can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet alone shows a standard import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a larger, benign application.",
