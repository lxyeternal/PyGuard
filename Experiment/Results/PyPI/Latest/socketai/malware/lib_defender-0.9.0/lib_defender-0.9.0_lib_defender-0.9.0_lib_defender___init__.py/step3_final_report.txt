{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of 'main_function' from a local module 'core', likely to be used within a larger application or script.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to the import statement; no data flows from source to sink within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import, common in modular Python projects. It does not execute any code or handle data directly. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The import of 'main_function' suggests that further code may invoke this function, but based solely on this snippet, there is no malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious activity. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
