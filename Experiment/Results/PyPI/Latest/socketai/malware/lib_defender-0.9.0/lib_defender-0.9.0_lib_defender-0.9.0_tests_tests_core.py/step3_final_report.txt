  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input reading functions, data processing segments, external network calls, dynamic code execution (eval), hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network transmission, system modifications, or sensitive data access.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via data processing, possibly through obfuscated or dynamic code segments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, eval usage, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, and dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The majority of reports indicate benign, straightforward code with no malicious indicators, justified by low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5 presents clear signs of malicious activity, including obfuscation, eval, hardcoded secrets, and network activity, leading to higher scores. The scores across reports are consistent with their descriptions, with benign reports maintaining low scores and the suspicious one justifying higher scores. Overall, the assessments are reasonable, with the combined risk, malware, and obfuscation scores reflecting the evidence provided.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risks, while one report indicates significant malicious behavior justifying elevated scores. The current scoring system aligns well with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary.",
