      "conclusion": "The code exhibits strong indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscation and dynamic execution of decoded strings. While no explicit payload is visible, the pattern is typical of malicious scripts aiming to hide their true intent. The risk is high, and the code should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis confirms safety."
