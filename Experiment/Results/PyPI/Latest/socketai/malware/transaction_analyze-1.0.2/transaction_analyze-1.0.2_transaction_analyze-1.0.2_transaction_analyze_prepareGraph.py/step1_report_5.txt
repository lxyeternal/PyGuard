{
  "purpose": "The code appears to prepare a JSON graph for visualization and update a graph with financial data from Binance.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from parameters (json_dump, selected_coin, selected_interval), and potentially from external sources via get_binance_data.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to a JavaScript file, potentially to be used in a web page. No untrusted data sinks are directly executing code or handling sensitive data beyond file write.",
  "flows": "json_dump data flows into a JavaScript variable in a file; get_binance_data fetches external data, processed into a plot.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code for modifying an HTML file, which could have been used for malicious modifications, but is inactive. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The function 'prepareGraph' creates a JavaScript file embedding JSON data, which is standard for visualization. The commented code suggests previous or potential manipulations of HTML files, but currently inactive. The 'update_graph' function relies on external data fetching (get_binance_data) and plotting functions, which are assumed to be legitimate. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration observed. The code does not include any unsafe code injection, credential handling, or malicious network activity within the visible scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended for data visualization. There are no indicators of malicious intent or malicious behavior in its current form.",
