{
  "purpose": "The code prepares a JSON graph data file for visualization and updates a graph with Binance data.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON data from a parameter (json_dump), reading from and writing to files ('%s.js', quark.html).",
  "sinks": "Writing to a JavaScript file, potential reading from external data source via get_binance_data.",
  "flows": "json_dump → write to '%s.js' file; get_binance_data → extract_data → create_trend_plot.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code for modifying HTML, no apparent malicious activity. Usage of open() for file writing is standard.",
  "analysis": "The function prepareGraph constructs a JavaScript file containing JSON data but does not execute or incorporate untrusted code dynamically. The update_graph function fetches external data from Binance and visualizes it, which is standard for data visualization tools. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious data handling, or obfuscated code. The commented code relates to HTML modification, which is benign. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward data visualization helper with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly handling data formatting, file writing, and visualization. No malicious behavior detected.",
