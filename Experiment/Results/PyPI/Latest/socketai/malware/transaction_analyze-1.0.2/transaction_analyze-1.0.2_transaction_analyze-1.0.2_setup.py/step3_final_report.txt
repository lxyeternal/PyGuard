  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for 'transaction_analyze' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static string literals defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no data flow or execution beyond package metadata definition.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual 'license' field value 'Python Script', but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with static parameters, no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscated elements. Dependencies are benign. The only minor anomaly is the license string, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the static, benign nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. Confidence in benign assessment is high (1). No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the static, non-malicious nature of the code. The only minor concern is the unconventional license string, which does not pose security issues.",
