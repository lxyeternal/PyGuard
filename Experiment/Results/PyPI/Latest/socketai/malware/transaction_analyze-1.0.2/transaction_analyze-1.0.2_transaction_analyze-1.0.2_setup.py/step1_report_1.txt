  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'transaction_analyze' Python package.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals for package name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or external inputs are processed at runtime.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; static setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. Use of 'license' field with a non-standard value ('Python Script') but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with static parameters to configure the package. All parameters are hardcoded with no dynamic or external input, reducing risk. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident. Dependencies are specified plainly without suspicious versions. No executable code, network operations, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions solely as a standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
