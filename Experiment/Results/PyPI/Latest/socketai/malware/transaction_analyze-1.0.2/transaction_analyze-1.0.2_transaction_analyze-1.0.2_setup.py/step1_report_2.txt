{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'transaction_analyze' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, description, author, license, dependencies, and extras from the source code itself.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or external data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the code only assigns static values to setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The license is set to 'Python Script', which is unusual and potentially non-standard; no other anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setuptools setup script with no user input, no dynamic code execution, and no external data processing. The dependencies specified are benign, and the setup configuration appears standard. The license string is unconventional but not malicious. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is typical for packaging a Python project with no malicious or suspicious elements. The only minor concern is the unconventional license string, which does not impact security. Overall, the code poses no security threats.",
