  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'transaction_analyze'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data such as package name, version, description, author, license, dependencies, and extras.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or external data output occurs in this script.",
  "flows": "The flow is static configuration data from source variables to the setup() function call, with no external data flow or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The license field is non-standard ('Python Script') but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. There are no user inputs, network operations, or code execution. Dependencies are explicitly listed; no suspicious dependencies are present. The license field is non-standard but harmless. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python project.",
