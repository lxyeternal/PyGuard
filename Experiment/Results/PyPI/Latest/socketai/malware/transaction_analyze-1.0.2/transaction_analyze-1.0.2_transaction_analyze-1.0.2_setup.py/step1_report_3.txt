{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'transaction_analyze'.",
  "sources": "Reads static data such as package name, version, description, author, license, dependencies, and optional development dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external outputs observed.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs, or malicious behavior. The license field is unusual ('Python Script') but not malicious; it may be incorrect or non-standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with static metadata and dependencies. All data are hardcoded strings or lists, typical for a setup.py file. No input reading, no external data sources, no code execution beyond package configuration. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious intent. Dependencies are standard and well-known. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any suspicious elements.",
