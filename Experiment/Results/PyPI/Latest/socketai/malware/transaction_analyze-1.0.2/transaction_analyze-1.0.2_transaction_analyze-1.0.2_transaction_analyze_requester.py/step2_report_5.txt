  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code monitors wallets, logs changes, plays sounds, handles API requests, and exception handling. No malicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation. Concerns about infinite loop are noted but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, and no malicious activity is evident. The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given resource exhaustion potential but not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on legitimate API use, no malicious code, minor concerns about input validation and hardcoded sound file path.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No signs of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** The code fetches wallet data, detects changes, logs, and plays sounds. Minor issues include unused 'requester' function, missing imports, and hardcoded sound filename. No malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The minor code issues are acknowledged but do not imply malicious intent. The risk score remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with mention of the 'requester' function and external API calls. No malicious activity. Minor concerns about unused functions and hardcoded resources.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malware or obfuscation, low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** The code monitors wallets, logs, plays sounds, and uses a set to track processed transactions, which resets each loop, possibly causing duplicate alerts. The 'requester' function is unused but potentially vulnerable if misused. No malicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The only noteworthy point is the local 'processed_transactions' set reset each iteration, which affects functionality but not security. The risk score remains low.\n\n---\n\n### Overall observations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code does not exhibit malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** Consistently at 0.2, reflecting minor concerns about resource exhaustion, hardcoded resources, and unused functions, but no significant security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis.\n\n- No adjustments needed; the assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (minor issues like resource exhaustion potential, hardcoded files, unused functions)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' evaluations are justified. The code is safe, with minimal operational concerns, but no malicious intent or obfuscation present.",
