{
  "purpose": "The code monitors specified Bitcoin wallets for balance changes and new transactions, logging updates and playing a notification sound.",
  "sources": "Wallet data provided as input; requests to external API at https://blockchain.info/rawaddr/{wallet_address}; reading response data; reading wallet info (address, name, balance, last_timestamp).",
  "sinks": "Console output; file writing for logs; playing sound with winsound; access to external API over HTTP.",
  "flows": "Wallet addresses are used to construct API URLs (source) -> HTTP requests fetch wallet data (sink) -> parsed JSON data is used to detect changes or transactions (flow) -> logged/output and sound notification (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code plays a sound file 'soundfile.wav' on each transaction detection without validation; no hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated code or suspicious code patterns. The code includes an infinite loop without exit condition, which could cause denial of service if misused, but not malicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The code continuously monitors Bitcoin wallet balances and transactions via API calls, updating local wallet info and logging changes. It uses requests for API access, handles exceptions, and plays sounds for notifications. No malicious code or backdoors are present. The sound file is hardcoded, but this is standard for notification features. No user data or credentials are handled insecurely; environment variables are not used. The use of external API calls is legitimate for monitoring. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious code segments. The infinite loop could be misused to cause resource exhaustion, but that is a design issue, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform legitimate wallet monitoring functions with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It makes API requests, logs data, and plays notifications. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. The only concern is potential resource exhaustion due to infinite loop, but this is not malicious. Overall, the code is safe with a very low malware likelihood.",
