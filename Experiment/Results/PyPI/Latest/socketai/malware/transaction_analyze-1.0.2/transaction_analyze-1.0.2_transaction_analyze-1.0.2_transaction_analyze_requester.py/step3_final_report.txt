{
  "purpose": "The code monitors Bitcoin wallets by periodically fetching data from blockchain.info, detecting balance changes and new transactions, logging these events, and playing notification sounds upon transaction detection.",
  "sources": "The code reads wallet addresses and associated data from the 'wallets' list; it also reads the response from the blockchain.info API via requests.get().",
  "sinks": "The code writes logs to a file; it outputs to the console; it plays a sound file ('soundfile.wav') upon transaction detection.",
  "flows": "Wallet addresses are used to construct API URLs (source); responses are parsed to detect balance and transaction changes (source to sink); transaction hashes are checked against 'processed_transactions' to avoid duplicates (source to sink); logs and notifications are generated (source to sink).",
  "anomalies": "The 'processed_transactions' set is re-initialized each cycle, causing potential duplicate alerts; missing imports ('time', 'datetime') would cause runtime errors; the 'requester' function is unused; the sound file path is hardcoded; the infinite loop could lead to resource exhaustion; no input validation or security checks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate wallet monitoring by querying an external API, detecting changes, and notifying the user. It does not contain any malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. The main issues are operational: missing imports, inefficient transaction tracking, and potential resource exhaustion due to the infinite loop. The sound notification and API usage are standard. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity is present. The code's behavior aligns with a benign monitoring tool, with minor design flaws that do not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, legitimate Bitcoin wallet monitoring script with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The low security risk score of 0.2 reflects minor operational issues rather than security threats. The code is clear, non-obfuscated, and safe for use in production with minor improvements.",
