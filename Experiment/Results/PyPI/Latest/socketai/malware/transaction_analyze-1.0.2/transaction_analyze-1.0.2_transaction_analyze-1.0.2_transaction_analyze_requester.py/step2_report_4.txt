  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code against the described issues, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the code's purpose: monitoring wallets via API, logging, and playing sounds.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Notes that the code plays sounds without validation, no credentials, no obfuscation, and an infinite loop that could cause resource exhaustion but isn't malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code is legitimate with low malware likelihood, confidence at 0.9.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No issues found. The low security risk score is justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly describes the code's function.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Highlights lack of input validation, hardcoded sound path, and the 'requester' function that is unused. No malicious behavior identified.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately low risk, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious intent or malware signals. The minor concerns are about robustness, not security.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly summarized.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Notes unused 'requester' function, missing imports ('time', 'datetime'), but no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states low risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The mention of missing imports is a technical oversight but not malicious. The report is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Mentions the 'requester' function, no malicious activity, but notes the infinite loop and external request usage.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate assessment; low risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the code's behavior is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Points out that 'processed_transactions' resets each loop, leading to potential duplicate alerts. Notes the URL construction is safe in context.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately low risk, benign code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The reinitialization of 'processed_transactions' is a minor functional flaw, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Observations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Consistently 0.2, reflecting minor concerns like resource exhaustion potential or lack of input validation, but no real security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — minor issues, but overall low risk.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The code's infinite loop could be optimized or controlled, but this isn't malicious.\n- The 'processed_transactions' set should be persistent across iterations to avoid duplicate alerts, but this is a functional flaw, not a security concern.\n- The 'requester' function is unused, which could be cleaned up but doesn't pose a security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears safe, with no malware or malicious intent. The minor issues are operational or robustness concerns, not security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and risk score at 0.2.",
