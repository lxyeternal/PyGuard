  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple suspicious features—dynamic code execution, obfuscated strings, network URL handling—that elevate its threat level. While not definitively malicious in isolation, these patterns are indicative of potential malicious intent or misuse. I recommend treating this code as moderately malicious with a malware score of 0.6, obfuscation score of 0.6, and overall security risk of 0.7, warranting further analysis and caution."
