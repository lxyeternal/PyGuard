  "purpose": "Detects the operating system and manages terminal color output accordingly, primarily for cross-platform compatibility.",
  "sources": "sys.platform, platform.platform(), platform.version()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Platform detection leads to setting 'colors' flag, which determines color variable definitions",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system('') as a workaround for enabling ANSI sequences on Windows 10; platform detection logic may be fragile due to string parsing assumptions",
  "analysis": "The code performs OS detection and sets terminal color variables accordingly. It disables colors on Windows, macOS, and iOS, and enables ANSI sequences on Windows 10 with build >= 10586 using a known workaround. No malicious behavior, code injection, or data leaks are present. The platform detection relies on string checks that could be fragile if platform strings vary. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities. Scores are assigned as malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily handling OS detection and terminal coloring. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low risk score is appropriate, with no malware detected.",
