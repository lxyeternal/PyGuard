{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for blockchain data retrieval, database management, and testing scaffolding, primarily for blockchain analysis and testing environments.",
  "sources": "Blockchain node interactions (w3.eth.get_block, get_transaction), external API responses (mempool.space), file system (writing transactions), database access, and test mocks.",
  "sinks": "Data written to SQLite database, files, and external API responses stored in memory or files.",
  "flows": "Blockchain data and API responses flow into database and files; test mocks intercept database and session interactions; external API data flows into storage without manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Minor code issue: missing import of 'requests' in fetch_latest_transactions, but this is a technical bug, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard for blockchain data collection, database handling, and testing scaffolding. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. External API usage is to legitimate services. The complex mocking in testing is typical. No obfuscation or secrets are detected. The code's purpose aligns with legitimate data analysis and testing activities. The minor omission of 'requests' import is a technical oversight, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
