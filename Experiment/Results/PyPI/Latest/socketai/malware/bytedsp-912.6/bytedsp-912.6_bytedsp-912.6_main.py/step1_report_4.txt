  "purpose": "Collects system information (hostname, username, current directory) and sends it to multiple remote URLs with a random identifier, potentially for tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Performs HTTP GET requests to remote URLs, transmitting system info via URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, random number) -> URL encoding -> HTTP request to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external URLs, transmitting system info without user consent, reliance on untrusted domains, and no apparent legitimate purpose. The URLs seem to be obfuscated or hidden malicious domains. The code collects sensitive data (hostname, username, directory) and transmits it openly.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers basic system information and a random number, then sends this data to multiple external URLs which appear suspicious. No validation or encryption is present. The URLs look malicious or are used for tracking purposes. The code runs unconditionally, sending potentially sensitive data to these domains. No user interaction, encryption, or safeguards are implemented. The URLs' domains are suspicious, and the code’s purpose aligns with potentially malicious data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be collecting system info and transmitting it to potentially malicious or suspicious domains without user consent. It could be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or malicious data collection. Overall, it demonstrates malicious intent and security risks.",
