  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to remote URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send data to external URLs",
  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current directory) collected from sources, encoded into URL parameters, and sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains",
  "anomalies": "The code sends system data to multiple external URLs without user consent or clear purpose; the URLs are suspiciously structured and not typical for legitimate package functionality; no validation or authorization checks are present; the use of random number in URL may be for tracking or session identification.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system details such as hostname, username, and current directory. It constructs URLs pointing to external domains, appending these details along with a random number. It attempts to open these URLs, which could result in data leakage or remote tracking. The URLs are not associated with any known legitimate service and are suspiciously structured, indicating potential malicious intent. The code does not perform any meaningful functionality besides this data exfiltration. No malicious code is hidden within obfuscated code or complex logic, but the behavior itself is suspicious. It could be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or other malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to exfiltrate system information to external domains without consent, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The behavior aligns with data collection or tracking activities, indicating a security concern.",
