  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple external URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to external URLs",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory) collected as sources → encoded into URL parameters → sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains",
  "anomalies": "Usage of multiple external URLs that appear suspicious; collection and transmission of hostname, username, and current directory without user consent; no clear benign purpose; use of random number for URL parameter to possibly avoid detection or tracking; lack of user notification or consent",
  "analysis": "The script gathers host, user, and directory information and transmits it to three external domains via HTTP GET requests. The URLs appear suspicious and are associated with potential malicious activity (e.g., command and control, data exfiltration). The code uses standard libraries but performs potentially harmful network communication. The random number in URL may be used to distinguish requests or evade detection. No explicit malicious code such as backdoors, file modification, or persistence mechanisms is present, but the data collection and transmission behavior is suspicious and could be malicious if used without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to silently collect system data and send it to external servers, indicating potential malicious activity related to surveillance or data theft. While no direct malicious payloads like system modification are present, the behavior itself is suspicious and could compromise user privacy or security.",
