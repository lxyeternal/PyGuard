  "flows": "Collect hostname, username, current directory, generate random number -> build URLs with parameters -> send HTTP requests to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external URLs with obfuscated domain patterns, transmission of system info without user consent, no clear legitimate purpose, reliance on random number for URL differentiation",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, current directory, and a random number, then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains, and sends HTTP GET requests to these URLs with the collected data as query parameters. The URLs appear malicious or at least suspicious, likely intended for tracking, reconnaissance, or exfiltration. The code does not perform any benign or clearly intended function; instead, it secretly reports system info to third-party servers. The lack of user notification, combined with the suspicious URLs and data collection, indicates malicious intent. The use of logging and exception handling is minimal but sufficient for basic operation. Overall, the script performs covert data transmission to potentially malicious endpoints.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by silently transmitting system information to suspicious external servers, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent and security risk.",
