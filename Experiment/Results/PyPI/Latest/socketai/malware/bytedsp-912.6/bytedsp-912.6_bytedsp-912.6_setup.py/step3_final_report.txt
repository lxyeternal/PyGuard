{
  "purpose": "The setup script executes a custom install class that, after standard installation, imports and runs 'main()' from 'main.py', executing arbitrary code during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data when importing 'main' from 'main.py' during the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The execution of 'main()' acts as a sink where untrusted code can run, potentially leading to malicious actions or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Source: import of 'main' in run(); sink: execution of 'main()' during setup; flow: code execution occurs immediately after installation begins.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs code execution during setup, which is unusual and potentially malicious; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, after completing standard installation, imports 'main' from 'main.py' and executes 'main()'. This pattern allows arbitrary code execution during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The behavior is not standard practice and introduces significant security risks, especially if 'main.py' contains malicious code. The scores assigned in the reports vary, with higher scores (0.75-0.8) reflecting the potential danger. The overall risk depends on the trustworthiness of 'main.py', but the pattern itself is inherently risky and warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a supply chain security risk. The scores in the reports are appropriate, with higher scores justified if 'main.py' is malicious. Overall, this pattern should be flagged as high risk unless 'main.py' is verified safe.",
