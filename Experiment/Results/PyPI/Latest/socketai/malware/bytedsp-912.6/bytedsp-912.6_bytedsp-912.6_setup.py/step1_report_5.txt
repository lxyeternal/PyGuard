{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'bytedsp' Python package that customizes the install process to run a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own modules ('setuptools', 'install') and imports 'main' from main.py during installation.",
  "sinks": "The code executes 'main()' from main.py during install, which could be a potential sink if 'main()' contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method executes, calling 'install.run(self)' and then executing 'main()' from main.py.",
  "anomalies": "Custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' runs code ('main()') after installation, which is unusual and can be exploited if 'main()' is malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code in the setup script itself.",
  "analysis": "The setup script overrides the 'install' command to run 'main()' from main.py after installation completes. This behavior could be used to execute arbitrary code at install time. The code imports 'requests' as a dependency, which is standard. The class name 'CrazyInstallStrat' is unusual but not inherently malicious. The critical aspect is the execution of 'main()' during install, which could be malicious if 'main()' is compromised. No other anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard setup procedures with a custom install step that executes 'main()'. This could be malicious if 'main()' contains malicious code. The overall risk depends on the content of 'main.py'. Without inspecting 'main.py', the potential for malicious behavior exists due to the execution of arbitrary code during installation.",
