  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a supply chain security risk. The scores in the reports are appropriate, with higher scores justified if 'main.py' is malicious. Overall, this pattern should be flagged as high risk unless 'main.py' is verified safe."
