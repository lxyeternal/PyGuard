      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a supply chain security risk. The scores in the reports are appropriate, with higher scores justified if 'main.py' is malicious. Overall, this pattern should be flagged as high risk unless 'main.py' is verified safe."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-confidence malicious behavior characterized by covertly transmitting system information to suspicious external URLs, indicating data exfiltration or tracking. The malware and security risk scores should be adjusted upward to reflect this high severity, with malware score at approximately 0.9 and security risk at approximately 0.9. The code is not obfuscated, so the obfuscated score remains 0."
