  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the setup script is a standard Python packaging configuration.\n- No untrusted data processing, network activity, or code execution based on external inputs is present.\n- The use of `open(\"README.md\").read()` is typical for including package descriptions.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are consistently 0, indicating no identified vulnerabilities.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis that the script is a standard setup configuration with no security issues.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are uniform and consistent; no contradictions or unreasonable scores are present.\n- The only minor point is the use of `open(\"README.md\").read()` without exception handling, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts and not malicious.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- Since the setup script is static and only reads a local file, there's no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- The dependency on `requests` is noted, but its presence in `install_requires` does not imply malicious intent; it's a common dependency.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero to account for the minimal risk associated with file reading, but practically negligible)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, benign setup.py script for packaging a Python project. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Keep the overall security risk very low, around 0.1, acknowledging the minimal potential for issues due to file handling.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe setup script is safe, standard, and poses no security threat.",
