{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'envvenuma' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata from the setup script, reading README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the script does not process untrusted input or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are detected. The script straightforwardly specifies package info.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for Python packaging, importing setuptools, and calling setup() with package metadata. It reads the README.md for description, specifies dependencies, and package classifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, no reading from environment variables, no network calls, and no obfuscated or suspicious code segments. The package appears intended for distribution without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily contains metadata and dependency information with standard usage.",
