  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'envvenuma', defining metadata, dependencies, and reading the README file for description.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file during setup execution",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data leakage points",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.md' during setup; no data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without exception handling, but this is standard in setup scripts and not malicious",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or processing of untrusted input. Reading 'README.md' is typical and safe. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and accurate.",
