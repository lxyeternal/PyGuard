  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'envvenuma' to specify metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Open() function reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None, as no untrusted data is processed or transmitted in this script.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'README.md' into the 'long_description' field; no other data flow involves untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without exception handling is typical in setup scripts; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for the long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leaks. The open() call is used to read package description content, which is common practice. No sources or sinks suggest untrusted data handling. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate, typical Python package setup file with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
