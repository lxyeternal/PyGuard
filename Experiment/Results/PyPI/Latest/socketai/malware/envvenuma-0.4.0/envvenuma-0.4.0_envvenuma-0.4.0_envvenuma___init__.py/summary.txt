  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or malicious payloads but performs high-risk data exfiltration by transmitting sensitive environment variables to an external endpoint with embedded tokens. This behavior poses a serious security threat due to potential data leakage but is not inherently malicious software. The malware score should be low, while the security risk score remains high."
