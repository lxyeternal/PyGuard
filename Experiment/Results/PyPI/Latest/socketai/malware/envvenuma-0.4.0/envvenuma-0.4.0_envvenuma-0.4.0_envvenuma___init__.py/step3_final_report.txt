  "purpose": "The code collects environment variables via os.environ and printenv, then transmits them to an external webhook URL, potentially exposing sensitive data.",

  "flows": "Source (environment variables) -> send_message_to_google_chat -> external webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL containing embedded tokens; transmission of all environment variables without validation or encryption",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves environment variables and system environment output, then sends this data unencrypted to a hardcoded external webhook URL containing sensitive tokens. No validation, sanitization, or encryption is applied. The behavior indicates potential data exfiltration of sensitive information, but no malicious payloads or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and lacks obfuscation. The primary security concern is the leakage of environment data, including secrets, via an unprotected channel. The malware score should be low (around 0.1-0.2) since no malicious payloads exist, but the security risk remains high (~0.8) due to data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or malicious payloads but performs high-risk data exfiltration by transmitting sensitive environment variables to an external endpoint with embedded tokens. This behavior poses a serious security threat due to potential data leakage but is not inherently malicious software. The malware score should be low, while the security risk score remains high.",
