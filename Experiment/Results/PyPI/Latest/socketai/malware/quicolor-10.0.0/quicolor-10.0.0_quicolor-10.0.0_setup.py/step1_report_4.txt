  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'quicolor' to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads static package metadata (name, version, author info), dependencies ('requests'), and package structure from the code.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard setup configuration. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It does not perform any runtime code execution, network activity, or data handling beyond static configuration. No indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python utility. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
