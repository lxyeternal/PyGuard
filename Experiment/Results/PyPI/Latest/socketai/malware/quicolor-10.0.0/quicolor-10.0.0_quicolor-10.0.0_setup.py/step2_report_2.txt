  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same setup.py code, which is a standard package configuration script.\n- The code is static, uses common practices, and involves no dynamic or external data processing.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The only dependency is 'requests', which is a widely used library and does not imply malicious intent by itself.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct and functions as intended for package setup.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports indicate any malicious behavior; all conclude the code is benign.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risks:** No vulnerabilities or security risks are evident.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the code or the reports.\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying the benign nature of the script.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is justified.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or 0.5. Given the analysis, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk score:\n- The code is static, with no dynamic or external data, no obfuscation, and no malicious indicators.\n- The only dependency is a common library ('requests'), which does not imply malicious intent.\n- Therefore, a risk score of **0** is appropriate.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent.\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, benign setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The setup.py is a standard, safe package configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
