  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'quicolor'.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, packages, install_requires, author, author_email, description, keywords, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data; all parameters are static strings or known data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code simply configures package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward setup configuration with no dynamic execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to specify package metadata and dependencies. All data appears hardcoded and standard for Python package setup. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. There are no dynamic or obfuscated elements, no network activity, and no malicious code or backdoors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and standard in nature.",
