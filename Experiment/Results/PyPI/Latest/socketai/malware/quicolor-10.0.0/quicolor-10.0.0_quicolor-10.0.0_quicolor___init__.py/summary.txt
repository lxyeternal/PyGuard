  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a benign color formatting utility but contains embedded, covert data exfiltration functionality targeting Telegram user data. It is triggered automatically during normal function calls, using hardcoded credentials and background threads, which makes it highly malicious and a severe security threat. The malware score is approximately 0.9, the security risk score is about 0.9, and there is no obfuscation present. It should be flagged as malicious due to its covert data theft capabilities."
