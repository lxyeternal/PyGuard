  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static string, serving as a benign test or illustrative module.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or environment variables; static code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written, transmitted, or used in a way that could leak or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the function returns a constant string without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static function with no external dependencies, inputs, or outputs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No suspicious behaviors, data leaks, or malicious intents are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and analysis are accurate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
