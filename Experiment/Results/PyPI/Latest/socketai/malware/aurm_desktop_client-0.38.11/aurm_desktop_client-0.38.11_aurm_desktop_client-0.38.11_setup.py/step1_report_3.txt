  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to fetch and store a remote database configuration, and potentially modify user shell configuration files.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a remote URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb). It also reads and writes to local configuration files (~/.fleetwood.py, ~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile).",
  "sinks": "Writing to local configuration files (~/.fleetwood.py, ~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile), which could affect user environment setup.",
  "flows": "Fetch data from remote URL -> Save to ~/.fleetwood.py -> Append command to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile if not present.",
  "anomalies": "Fetching a potentially sensitive database configuration from a remote URL during installation and modifying user shell configuration files without explicit user consent. The remote URL content is directly written to a file and executed via a command, which could be malicious if the URL content is harmful.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that downloads content from a specified URL and saves it to a hidden file (~/.fleetwood.py). It then appends a command to run this script in common shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile). These actions could modify user environment variables or execute arbitrary code without clear user knowledge. The URL is hardcoded and is fetched during installation, which is a common tactic for malicious code to retrieve remote payloads. Although the code catches exceptions broadly, it still performs network and filesystem modifications that could be malicious if the URL content is harmful or malicious. No obfuscated code or suspicious function calls are present beyond this network and file manipulation. The overall behavior resembles potentially malicious activity designed to persist or execute remote code in user environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code fetches and executes remote content during package installation and modifies user shell configuration files to run this content, which poses a significant security risk. This behavior indicates malicious intent or at least highly suspicious behavior with potential for compromise of user systems.",
