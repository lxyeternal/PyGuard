{
  "purpose": "During package installation, fetches remote data, saves it locally, and appends a command to user shell configuration files to enable persistent remote code execution.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen() fetches data from a hardcoded URL; file writes to ~/.fleetwood.py, ~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile; reading and writing to these files.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded script via 'python3 ~/.fleetwood.py' in user shell startup files; silent overwriting and appending to user environment files.",
  "flows": "Remote URL fetch -> save to ~/.fleetwood.py -> append 'python3 ~/.fleetwood.py' to ~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile -> execution upon shell startup.",
  "anomalies": "Broad try-except blocks suppress all errors; no validation or signature verification of downloaded content; persistent modifications to user configs; remote code fetched during install without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads external content from a hardcoded URL during installation, writes it to a local file, and appends a command to user shell configs to execute this file on shell startup. Exception handling is broad and silent, hiding errors. No validation or signature checks are performed on the remote content, enabling potential execution of malicious code. The modifications are persistent, creating a backdoor-like setup. The straightforward nature of the code indicates no obfuscation. These behaviors align with typical malware or backdoor patterns, facilitating remote code execution, persistence, and potential system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious and malicious behavior, including remote code fetching, silent environment modification, and persistent execution setup. Given the potential for remote control, data exfiltration, or system compromise, the malware score should be set to 1, and the security risk score should also be 1. The code should be considered malicious and flagged accordingly.",
