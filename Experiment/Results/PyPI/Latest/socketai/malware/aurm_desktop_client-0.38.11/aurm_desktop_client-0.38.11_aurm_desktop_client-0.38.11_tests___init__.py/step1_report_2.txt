  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no input/output operations",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; import is static code execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard package initialization",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python package __init__.py file that imports a specific function from a local module and defines __all__ for exports. There are no dynamic code execution, data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. It is a typical pattern for exposing package components.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package initialization script with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
