  "sinks": "No sinks present in the code; no data leaks or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Imported test_function may be used elsewhere, but no flow is evident in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward import and export",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a sibling module and defines __all__ for export. It is a standard pattern in Python packages to organize tests or exports. No suspicious activity, no malicious code, and no anomalies detected in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initialization file for testing purposes with no malicious intent or security issues.",
