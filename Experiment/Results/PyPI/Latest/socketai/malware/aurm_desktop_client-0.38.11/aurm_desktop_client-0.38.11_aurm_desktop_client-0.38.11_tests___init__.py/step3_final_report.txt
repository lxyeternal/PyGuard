  "purpose": "Initialize the tests package by importing 'test_function' from '.module1' and exposing it via '__all__'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .module1 importing test_function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import with no data flow.",
  "flows": "Import of test_function from module1, then exposure via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export pattern with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python __init__.py file that imports a function from a sibling module and exposes it. There are no dynamic code executions, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify this pattern as benign. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, which is appropriate given the simplicity and safety of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization file with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
