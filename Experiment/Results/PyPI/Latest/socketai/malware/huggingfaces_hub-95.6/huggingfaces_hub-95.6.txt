      "conclusion": "The pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and could be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The current reports' scores are appropriate, but considering the potential severity, a malware score around 0.5 and a security risk score around 0.7 are justified to reflect the inherent risk of this pattern."

      "conclusion": "The script is not traditional malware but exhibits malicious-like behavior through covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, raising significant security and privacy concerns. Its activity warrants high security risk assessment and a malware score reflecting covert exfiltration rather than payload-based maliciousness."
