  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs for tracking or data collection.",
  "sources": "Reading system info: platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which uses subprocess calls; generating random number with random.randint().",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to external URLs with embedded parameters; encoding MAC addresses in base64.",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) is encoded and included as URL parameters, then sent over HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs that seem suspicious or malicious; MAC addresses are base64-encoded and sent out; no validation or encryption of data; silent exception handling which may hide issues.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, possibly to obscure their contents. It then constructs URLs with these parameters and makes HTTP GET requests to potentially malicious or tracking domains. The URLs are suspicious, indicating potential data exfiltration or tracking behavior. The code does not validate responses or handle errors meaningfully, which could be hiding malicious activity or simply be for stealth. The collection and transmission of hardware identifiers (MAC addresses) combined with user/system info indicates a privacy invasion or malicious tracking purpose. No obfuscation or malicious code injection was found beyond the data exfiltration pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for tracking or exfiltrating system information, including MAC addresses, to external servers. The use of suspicious URLs and encoding methods raises concern of malicious intent, likely for covert data collection or surveillance.",
