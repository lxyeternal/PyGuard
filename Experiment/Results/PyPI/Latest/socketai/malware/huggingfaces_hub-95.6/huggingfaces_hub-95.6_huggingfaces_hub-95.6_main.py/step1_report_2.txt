  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it encoded to specific external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send data to external URLs",
  "flows": "System info collected via sources is encoded and appended as URL parameters, then transmitted over network through urlopen() calls to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple URLs with similar patterns, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, no validation or encryption of data, no response handling beyond pass, the URLs are suspicious and appear to be controlled by an external entity.",
  "analysis": "The code collects device-specific information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current working directory. It encodes the MAC addresses using base64, then constructs URLs with these parameters, including a random number. It makes network requests to external URLs that are suspicious and appear malicious, potentially exfiltrating user data without user consent. There are no malicious payloads like system modification, command execution, or data theft beyond data exfiltration. The code does not obfuscate itself but communicates with questionable domains. It is designed to gather system info and send it stealthily.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed for covert data collection and exfiltration, indicative of malicious behavior. It communicates with suspicious domains, encoding system identifiers and sending them without user awareness. Although it does not execute destructive commands, its purpose aligns with data theft or covert monitoring. Overall, it has a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
