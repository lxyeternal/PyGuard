{
  "purpose": "The code collects system hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and transmits this data via HTTP GET requests to external suspicious URLs.",
  "sources": "Platform-specific commands retrieving MAC addresses, platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint(), urllib.parse.urlencode()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with embedded parameters",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources flows into URL parameters, which are sent via HTTP GET requests to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious external URLs, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, silent exception handling, no validation or user notification, straightforward code structure",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert collection of hardware and system identifiers, encodes MAC addresses, and transmits this data to suspicious external domains without user consent. No malicious payloads or destructive commands are present, but the behavior indicates privacy invasion and potential malicious tracking. Exception handling is silent, which could hide errors. The URLs are suspicious and likely controlled by an attacker or tracker. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated, but its activity is covert and privacy-invasive.",
  "conclusion": "The script is not traditional malware but exhibits malicious-like behavior through covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, raising significant security and privacy concerns. Its activity warrants high security risk assessment and a malware score reflecting covert exfiltration rather than payload-based maliciousness.",
