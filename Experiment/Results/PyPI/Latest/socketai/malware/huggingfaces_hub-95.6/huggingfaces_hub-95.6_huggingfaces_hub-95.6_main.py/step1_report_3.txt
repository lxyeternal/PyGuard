  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current directory, then send this data encoded in base64 to multiple external URLs via GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node() for hostname, getpass.getuser() for username, os.getcwd() for current directory, get_mac_addresses() for MAC addresses, random.randint() for generating a number.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() which sends HTTP GET requests with the collected data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, MAC addresses, random number) → Data encoding (base64) and URL parameter assembly → HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain names, sending system info (including MAC addresses) to these URLs, encoding MAC addresses in base64 possibly to obfuscate data. The URLs and data collection could be used for tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes the MAC addresses in base64. It constructs URLs with these parameters and sends GET requests to external servers. The URLs are suspicious and appear to be controlled by an attacker or used for tracking. The data sent could be used for fingerprinting or malicious monitoring. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present, but the behavior indicates potential privacy invasion and tracking. The use of multiple external URLs with obfuscated data and the lack of legitimate purpose suggests malicious intent or at least malicious surveillance intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects system information and sends it to external servers with suspicious URLs, indicating malicious tracking or reconnaissance behavior. It does not contain malware in the traditional sense but demonstrates privacy-invasive and potentially malicious behavior.",
