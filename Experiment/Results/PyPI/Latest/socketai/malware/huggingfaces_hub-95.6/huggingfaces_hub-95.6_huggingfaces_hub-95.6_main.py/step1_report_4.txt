  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it encoded to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading network interface info, random.randint(), base64 encoding, URL parameters construction.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url) sending data over network to external servers.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) is collected, encoded, and sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domains, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, collection of MAC addresses on different OSes, and silent exception handling in network requests. No user input validation, and the URLs are obscure and non-legitimate-looking.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers detailed system info, including MAC addresses, and encodes the MAC addresses in base64. It then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends the data via HTTP GET requests without any user consent or notification. The URLs used are obscure, likely malicious or used for tracking or exfiltration. The exception handling suppresses errors, preventing detection of failures. The overall behavior resembles a tracking or data exfiltration mechanism embedded within an ostensibly benign script. No malicious payload such as reverse shells or file modification is present, but the data collection and transmission pattern is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs system reconnaissance and exfiltration of encoded MAC addresses and system info to suspicious external domains. Its behavior aligns with malicious data collection for tracking or unauthorized surveillance. While it doesn't execute harmful payloads directly, its covert data transmission indicates malicious intent.",
