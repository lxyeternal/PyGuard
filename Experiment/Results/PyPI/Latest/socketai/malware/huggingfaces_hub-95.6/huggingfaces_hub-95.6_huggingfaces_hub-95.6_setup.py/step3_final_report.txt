{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines a custom installation class that executes 'main()' from 'main.py' during package installation, which is unconventional and potentially risky.",
  "sources": "Import of 'main' from 'main.py' and execution within the 'run()' method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during install, which could run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the 'run()' method calls 'main()', executing code from 'main.py'.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external code ('main()') during setup, which is atypical and can be exploited if 'main.py' is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code executes 'main()' from 'main.py' during installation, posing a supply chain risk. No obfuscation or secrets are present. The pattern is suspicious because arbitrary code runs during setup, which could be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The reports' scores range from low to moderate malware suspicion (0.25-0.5) and security risk (0.4-0.6), which are reasonable given the pattern. The main concern is the potential for malicious payloads in 'main.py'. Without inspecting 'main.py', certainty is limited, but the pattern warrants caution. The scores should reflect the risk of executing untrusted code during install, which is a known attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and could be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The current reports' scores are appropriate, but considering the potential severity, a malware score around 0.5 and a security risk score around 0.7 are justified to reflect the inherent risk of this pattern.",
