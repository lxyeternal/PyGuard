  "purpose": "Utility functions for human-readable representations of time, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function arguments: bytes, Hash32, URI strings, and iterables of integers.",
  "sinks": "Output functions generate human-readable strings; no direct sinks for untrusted data or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into various functions that process and transform it into formatted strings; no external communication or data exfiltration points identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network interactions. The code appears to perform straightforward data formatting tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions focused on human-readable formatting for time durations, byte sequences, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences. It uses safe, standard libraries such as 'urllib.parse' and does not perform any data manipulations that could lead to injection, data leakage, or malicious activity. No external system interactions, network calls, or sensitive data handling are present. The functions are well-structured, with clear purpose, and do not contain suspicious code segments or potential backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of data formatting utilities with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any external network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. Overall, it appears safe and free from malware or supply chain risks.",
