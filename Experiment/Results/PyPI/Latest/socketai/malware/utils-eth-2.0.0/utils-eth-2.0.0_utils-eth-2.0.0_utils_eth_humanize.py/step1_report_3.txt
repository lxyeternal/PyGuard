  "purpose": "Utility functions for human-readable formatting of time, bytes, hashes, and IPFS URIs, as well as sequence processing.",
  "sources": "Input data from parameters such as bytes, strings (URIs), and integer sequences.",
  "sinks": "String formatting and parsing functions; no external or untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through validation and formatting functions, with no external communication or data leakage points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code primarily performs data formatting and validation tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to convert numerical values into human-readable strings, validate IPFS URIs, and process sequences of integers into ranges. It uses standard libraries and straightforward logic. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are present. The functions are purely computational, focusing on formatting and validation. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is present. The code's structure and content do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module intended for formatting and validation purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
