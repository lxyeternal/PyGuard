  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for humanizing seconds, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and sequences of integers for display or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Function inputs such as seconds (numeric), bytes, hashes, URI strings, and integer sequences.",
  "sinks": "Return statements generating formatted strings; no direct data sinks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through processing functions to formatted string outputs; no untrusted data flow to network, files, or environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. Functions perform straightforward formatting and validation. The IPFS URI validation is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions with clear, conventional logic: humanizing time durations, byte arrays, hashes, IPFS URIs, and sequences of integers. The functions rely on simple iterations, string slicing, and validation checks. No external network or system access, no cryptographic keys, nor any suspicious logic detected. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior observed. The IPFS validation is standard and matches CIDv0 scheme expectations. The functions do not process untrusted input in a manner that could lead to exploitation beyond normal validation and formatting.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign utility library aimed at formatting data for display purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code performs straightforward data validation and formatting without any external side effects or security vulnerabilities.",
