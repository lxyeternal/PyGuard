  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of utility functions for formatting durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences.\n- There are no external system calls, network interactions, or data exfiltration points.\n- Input validation is standard, particularly for IPFS URIs and CIDv0 hashes.\n- No obfuscated, dynamic, or malicious code structures are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are detected.\n- The functions are straightforward, with clear purposes and safe logic.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are also 0, consistent with the straightforward implementation.\n\n2. **Security Risks:**\n   - The reported security risk scores are very low (0.1 or 0), which is appropriate given the utility nature of the code.\n   - No evidence of supply chain vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or exploitable flaws.\n\n3. **Potential issues or assumptions:**\n   - The only minor point is the IPFS URI validation, which assumes CIDv0 hashes start with \"Qm\" and are 46 characters long. This is a standard validation for CIDv0 but does not cover CIDv1 or other schemes. However, this is a deliberate choice, not a vulnerability.\n   - No risky operations, such as executing untrusted input or manipulating external systems, are present.\n\n4. **Score justification:**\n   - Given the benign, utility-focused nature of the code, higher malware or risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The consistent low scores across all reports seem justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code appears to be a safe, well-implemented utility module.\n- No evidence supports assigning higher malware, obfuscated, or security risk scores.\n- The validation logic is standard and does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or 0, if stricter)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' consensus and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign set of utility functions with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
