{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for humanizing durations, byte sequences, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences.",
  "sources": "Reads include function parameters such as seconds, bytes, hash values, URIs, and integer sequences. No external data sources are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "Data is formatted into human-readable strings; no dangerous sinks like network, file, or environment modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed and formatted into strings; no untrusted data is sent to external systems or dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated logic, or hardcoded secrets detected. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data formatting and validation tasks. It includes functions for human-readable time, byte, hash, and IPFS URI representations, as well as sequence compression. No external calls, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. The functions validate input types, especially for IPFS URIs and hashes, and generate formatted output without side effects. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for data formatting and validation. There is no evidence of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is safe to use.",
