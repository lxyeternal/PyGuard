  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the validity of their conclusions, the correctness of their scoring, and any potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions for formatting durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and sequences.\n- No external network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present.\n- Validation functions (e.g., for IPFS URIs and CIDv0 hashes) are standard and straightforward.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic detected.\n- The code relies on simple, well-understood libraries and techniques.\n\n---\n\n### **Specific analysis of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Benign utility functions, no malicious behavior, high confidence.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malware or security risks identified. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, benign utility functions, no external calls or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The scoring aligns with the benign nature.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, safe processing, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No security concerns.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, safe validation, no external or malicious actions.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, no external system interactions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusions:**\n\n- **Code content:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign utility functions.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in most reports, reflecting minimal inherent risk in validation functions, which is reasonable.\n\n### **Potential discrepancies or concerns:**\n\n- **Obfuscation and malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0 or very close to 0 is appropriate. The slight increase to 0.1 in some reports is acceptable, possibly reflecting the minimal risk of validation errors or misuse, but not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — the code is straightforward, safe, and free of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** **0 to 0.1** — aligns with the benign nature; no significant security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or at most 0.05 to reflect minimal validation-related concerns)\n\n**Final note:** No changes necessary. The code is safe and well-understood.",
