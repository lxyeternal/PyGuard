{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for humanizing time durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and sequences of integers for display purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as seconds, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is directly sent to network, file system, or other external systems. Functions return formatted strings based on input data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatting functions, with no untrusted data passing into system commands or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or hidden logic is present. The code is straightforward utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of formatting and humanization functions, with safe handling of inputs. It correctly parses and processes data without performing unsafe operations. No external system calls, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The IPFS-related functions include validation for CIDv0 hashes, but this is standard validation logic. The functions handle data securely and do not process untrusted data in insecure ways. No anomalies, malicious injections, or privacy leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of benign utility functions for human-readable formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
