  "purpose": "Utility functions for humanizing durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences, primarily for formatting and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as seconds, bytes, Hash32 hashes, URI strings, and sequences of integers.",
  "sinks": "Validation functions for IPFS URIs and CIDv0 hashes; formatting outputs; no untrusted data sinks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation checks and formatting functions, with no external or system modifications involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard validation and formatting logic.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions for humanizing durations, bytes, hashes, and IPFS URIs, with validation for CIDv0 hashes. No network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present. Validation logic is standard and safe. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The functions perform formatting and validation tasks with no external side effects or data leaks. The code is benign, well-structured, and free of vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign utility library with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the minimal validation logic involved. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
