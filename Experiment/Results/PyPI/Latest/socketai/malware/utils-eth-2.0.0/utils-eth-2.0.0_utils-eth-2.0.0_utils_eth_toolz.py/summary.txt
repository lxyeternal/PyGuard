  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for optional dependency import with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify this as safe, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a very low security risk score. The slight elevation to 0.1 in one report due to volume of imports is justified but does not indicate actual risk."
