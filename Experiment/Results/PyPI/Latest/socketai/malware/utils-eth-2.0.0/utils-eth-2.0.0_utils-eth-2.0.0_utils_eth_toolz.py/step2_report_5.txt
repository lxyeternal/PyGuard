  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is purely import statements with a try-except fallback. No data processing, input/output, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The confidence is 1.0, which seems appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues or malicious activity. The report's assessment is accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; only import statements with fallback.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws detected. The reasoning is correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The confidence is 1.0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or security risk identified. The report is accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Again, only imports. No data flow or execution.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report notes the large number of imports as potentially suspicious, but in context, this is common for utility setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1. The security risk score is slightly above zero, perhaps reflecting the volume of imports, but no actual malicious activity is evident.\n- **Justification for scores:** The malware score is 0, which is correct. The security risk score of 0.1 might be slightly high given the benign nature, but considering the volume of imports, a cautious approach is understandable.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable. No malware detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern—imports only, no execution or data flow.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues; the reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The confidence is 0.9, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just dependency imports.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; import statements with fallback.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The confidence is 1.0.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, with a slight 0.1 in report 3, which is reasonable given the large number of imports but not indicative of actual risk.\n\n### Final thoughts:\n- The code is a standard pattern for optional dependency import with fallback, common in Python projects.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk beyond normal dependency management)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with no security concerns. The reports' evaluations are accurate and justified.",
