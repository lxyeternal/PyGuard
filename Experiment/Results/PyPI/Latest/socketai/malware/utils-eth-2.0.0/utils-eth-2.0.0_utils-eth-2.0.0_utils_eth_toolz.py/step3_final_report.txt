  "purpose": "Conditional import of utility functions from 'cytoolz' with fallback to 'toolz' for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'cytoolz' or 'toolz' modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely static import statements",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static imports only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import pattern with fallback",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a large set of functions from 'cytoolz', falling back to 'toolz' if 'cytoolz' is unavailable. It involves no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The import pattern is common for optional dependency management. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for optional dependency import with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify this as safe, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a very low security risk score. The slight elevation to 0.1 in one report due to volume of imports is justified but does not indicate actual risk.",
