{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import various utility functions from the 'cytoolz' package, and if that fails, from the 'toolz' package. It aims to facilitate functional programming and data manipulation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'cytoolz' and 'toolz' packages, which are standard library imports based on availability.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks are evident; the code only imports modules and functions without processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving untrusted sources; primarily import logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The import logic is straightforward, with fallback handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard import block that tries to import multiple functions from 'cytoolz' and, upon failure, from 'toolz'. This pattern is common for compatibility and does not include any dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious behavior. The list of imported functions covers a wide range of functional programming utilities, indicating an intent to use these functions elsewhere in the larger codebase. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The structure and content suggest a benign dependency management pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical dependency import pattern with fallback support. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe, with no anomalies or malware indicators.",
