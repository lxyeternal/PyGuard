{
  "purpose": "The code provides various utility functions for applying formatters, key mappings, and transformations to sequences, dictionaries, and values, mainly for data processing or normalization tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters such as lists, dictionaries, and callables. No external input sources (e.g., user input, network, environment variables) are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "The functions yield transformed data or return processed values. No data is sent to external systems or network destinations within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., sequences, dictionaries, values) through formatter functions, with conditional or positional logic applied. No external sinks are evident; data remains within function scope and yields or returns.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, obfuscated logic, or suspicious control flows. The deprecation warning indicates awareness of library updates but is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for data transformation, with proper error handling and input validation. The deprecation warning signals intended API evolution. No code appears to perform any malicious or suspicious activity. All operations are straightforward data processing steps, with no network access, file manipulations, or system commands. The functions operate on provided data structures and do not interact with external systems. The overall structure and logic are clear and standard for such utility libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for data formatting and transformation tasks, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to standard coding practices and contains no signs of sabotage or malware.",
