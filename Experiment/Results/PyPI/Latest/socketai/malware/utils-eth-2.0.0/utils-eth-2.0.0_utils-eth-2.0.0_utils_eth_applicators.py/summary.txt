  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility module for data transformation with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The minor security concern pertains to external functions passed as arguments, which should be trusted, but this is outside the scope of the code itself."
