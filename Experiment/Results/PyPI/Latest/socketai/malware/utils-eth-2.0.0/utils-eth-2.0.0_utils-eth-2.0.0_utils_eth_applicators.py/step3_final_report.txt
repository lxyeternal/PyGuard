  "purpose": "Utility functions for data transformation, formatting, mapping, and applying functions to data structures such as lists and dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, input data structures (lists, dicts), external formatter and condition functions passed as arguments.",
  "sinks": "In-memory data processing; no external sinks, network activity, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through transformation functions, with potential external functions acting as formatters or conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Usage of warnings for deprecation is standard. No dynamic code execution or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises well-structured utility functions for data formatting and mapping, with appropriate error handling and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. External functions provided as arguments could be misused if untrusted, but this is a general concern with such patterns, not specific to this code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The functions operate solely in-memory, and no external communication occurs. The deprecation warning in 'combine_argument_formatters' is standard practice. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility module for data transformation with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The minor security concern pertains to external functions passed as arguments, which should be trusted, but this is outside the scope of the code itself.",
