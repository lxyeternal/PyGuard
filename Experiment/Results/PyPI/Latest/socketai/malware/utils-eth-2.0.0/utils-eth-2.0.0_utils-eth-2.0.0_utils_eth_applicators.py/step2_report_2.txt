  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the code to assess the security implications.\n\n**1. Presence of malicious code or malware:**  \n- The code is a collection of utility functions for data formatting, mapping, and transformation.  \n- No dynamic code execution (e.g., eval, exec), network activity, or system modifications are present.  \n- External dependencies (decorators, functional, toolz) are used, but their trustworthiness is assumed.  \n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are detected.  \n- Error handling is standard and does not suggest malicious intent.\n\n**2. Logical flaws or errors:**  \n- The functions perform input validation and raise appropriate exceptions.  \n- The deprecation warnings indicate API evolution but are benign.  \n- No logical errors or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n**3. Scores assessment:**  \n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.  \n- Security risk scores are low (mostly around 0.1 to 0.2), consistent with benign utility code.  \n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting thorough analysis.\n\n**4. Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n- The main dependency for security is the trustworthiness of the formatter functions and decorators passed into these utilities.  \n- If untrusted or malicious functions are supplied as formatters or conditions, they could perform malicious actions (e.g., data exfiltration, code injection).  \n- However, this is a general risk of passing untrusted functions, not specific to this code. The code itself does not facilitate malicious behavior.\n\n**5. Obfuscation and malware suspicion:**  \n- No obfuscated code is present.  \n- No signs of malware or backdoors are detected.\n\n**6. Consistency of scores:**  \n- The provided scores are reasonable given the code's nature.  \n- The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, standard utility functions)\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the provided reports' assessments. The code is a benign utility module for data formatting and transformation with no malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** ~0.15 (considering the potential if external functions are malicious, but within this code, none are)  \n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and does not pose security threats. The only caveat is to ensure that any formatter functions or conditions supplied externally are trusted, which is a general best practice rather than a flaw in this code.",
