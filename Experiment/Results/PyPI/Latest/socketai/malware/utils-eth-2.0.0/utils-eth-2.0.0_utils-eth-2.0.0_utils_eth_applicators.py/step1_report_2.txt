{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for applying various data transformations, such as formatting, mapping, and conditional formatting, primarily on sequences and dictionaries.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments (e.g., sequences, dictionaries, values) and from imported modules (decorators, functional, toolz).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of external functions like formatters and conditionals, which could be malicious if they are untrusted or maliciously crafted, but these are passed as parameters and are not defined within the code itself.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments through formatter applications, conditional logic, and key mappings. External formatters or conditions could introduce malicious behavior if they are malicious functions passed as arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code uses warnings, exceptions, and function composition in a typical manner. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution such as eval or exec is present. The use of external decorators and functions could potentially be manipulated if those are compromised, but within this code, no malicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for data transformation tasks, applying formatters and key mappings, with proper error handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The use of warnings and exceptions is standard. Since external functions and decorators are used, the security depends on their trustworthiness, but the code itself does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions. There are no signs of obfuscation or malware embedded within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for data processing without malicious intent. It does not contain any malicious behavior or malware signatures. Its security risk level is very low, assuming all external components are trusted.",
