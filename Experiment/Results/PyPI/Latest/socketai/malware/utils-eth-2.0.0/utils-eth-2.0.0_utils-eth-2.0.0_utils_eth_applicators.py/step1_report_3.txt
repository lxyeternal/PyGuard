{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for applying various formatters and transformations to sequences, dictionaries, and data structures, primarily for data processing or validation tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments: lists, dictionaries, and callables that act as conditions or formatters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks for untrusted data that could lead to data leaks, code execution, or system harm. It primarily processes data in-memory without network or file system operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments through formatter functions, conditional logic, and generators that produce transformed data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. Usage of warnings.warn for deprecation is standard practice. No obfuscated code, code injection, or dynamic execution is evident. Exception handling is standard and pertains to data validation.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises functions for applying formatters at specific indices, sequences, or dictionary keys, with input validation and error handling. The deprecation warning indicates intended API evolution, not malicious intent. No network operations, file I/O, or system commands are used. The code does not manipulate environment variables or perform any system-level modifications. All functions operate on provided data without external interactions. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are detected, and no security risks such as injection or data exfiltration are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module for data formatting and transformation tasks. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides structured functions for in-memory data processing with appropriate input validation and deprecation warnings.",
