{
  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for applying various formatters and transformations to sequences, dictionaries, and individual values, mainly for data processing and formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters such as 'value' (lists, dicts, or other objects), and also potentially from external data when these functions are used in broader data pipelines.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the application of formatter functions to data elements, which could be dangerous if the formatter functions themselves are malicious or if untrusted data is processed. The code applies formatters and mappings but does not include any network, file I/O, or system commands, reducing risk of direct malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., 'value', 'sequence', 'dict') through formatter functions or conditions, with the possibility of errors raised during formatting (e.g., ValueError, TypeError). The flow is primarily data transformation, not data exfiltration or malicious commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external network calls are present. The only notable aspect is the deprecation warning, which is benign. The code does not include obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variable names. Error messages are clear and contextually relevant.",
  "analysis": "The code implements data formatting utilities: applying functions at specific indexes, combining multiple formatters, applying formatters to sequences, dictionaries, or arrays, conditionally applying formatters, and remapping dictionary keys. The functions use standard Python constructs, including generators and error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior. The deprecation warning indicates planned API changes but does not pose security concerns. All data transformations appear to be straightforward and do not involve unsafe operations such as code injection or network access. No external calls or system modifications are present. Overall, the code appears to be safe, intended for data processing, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of safe data transformation utilities without any evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes data via user-supplied functions and mappings but does not perform any harmful operations. The deprecation warning and clear error handling suggest a focus on maintainability and robustness, not security concerns.",
