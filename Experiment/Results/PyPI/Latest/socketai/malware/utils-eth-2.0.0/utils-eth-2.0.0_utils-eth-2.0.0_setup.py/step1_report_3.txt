{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'utils-eth', used for packaging and distributing Ethereum utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads data from './README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the setup() function uses predefined strings and variables.",
  "flows": "File content read (README.md) assigned to variable 'long_description' and passed to setup(). No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected; the code follows standard Python packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools functions, defines dependencies and extras, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscated segments, or security-sensitive behaviors. All dependencies are common and version-restricted appropriately. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to typical packaging practices and contains no anomalies or malware indicators.",
