{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'utils-eth', including dependencies and metadata, primarily for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "File input: reading the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not execute or process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading a static file ('README.md') and passing static data to setup(), no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is a standard setup script with package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, defines dependencies in 'extras_require', reads the README file for a long description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. All data are static strings or file contents, with no user input or network data handling. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed. The dependencies listed are standard Python packages used for testing, linting, documentation, and development. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate package configuration file with no malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard practices for Python package setup and does not contain any suspicious code or operations.",
