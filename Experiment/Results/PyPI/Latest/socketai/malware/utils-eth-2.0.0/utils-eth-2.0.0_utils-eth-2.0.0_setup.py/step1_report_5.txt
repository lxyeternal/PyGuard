  "purpose": "This script is used to configure and set up a Python package named 'utils-eth' for distribution, including dependency management and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing package configuration functions and data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; setup parameters are static and controlled within the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs; all data is predefined or from static files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs package setup using standard setuptools functions. Dependencies are declared explicitly with version constraints. External data is read only from a README file at setup time. No user input or untrusted data is processed. The code adheres to typical Python packaging practices and contains no indications of malicious activity or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate packaging code without suspicious or malicious logic.",
