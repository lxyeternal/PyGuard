  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Describes standard setup configuration for 'utils-eth'.\n- Findings: No untrusted data, no suspicious code, static data, standard dependencies.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, benign, no malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (assuming default, since not specified).\n\n**Assessment:** This is a straightforward setup script with no signs of malicious activity. The confidence is high. The risk score should remain low, and malware score is correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to report 1, standard package setup.\n- Findings: No untrusted data, no suspicious code, static dependencies.\n- Conclusion: Benign, typical setup script.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (assumed).\n\n**Assessment:** Again, no malicious indicators. The report is consistent, and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, package setup.\n- Findings: Reads README.md, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Standard, benign setup script.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (assumed).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues, scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup with dependencies.\n- Findings: No untrusted data, no dynamic execution, static configuration.\n- Conclusion: Typical setup script, no malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (assumed).\n\n**Assessment:** No suspicious activity, scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as others, package setup.\n- Findings: Reads README.md, no dynamic code, no untrusted data.\n- Anomaly: Slight mention of \"securityRisk\": 0.1, but no actual suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate setup code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score, but justified given the minimal concern about the code's nature. Still, no malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a standard Python setup script with no dynamic code, no obfuscated segments, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected; the code is purely configuration.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk assessment:** Very low; standard package setup, no malicious intent.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to reading a file, but no actual security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The package setup code is benign, follows best practices, and poses no security threat. The minor risk score reflects the inherent minimal risk in any code that reads files, but this is standard and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a typical, legitimate Python package setup script.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- Scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 for conservative caution.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed report or further analysis.",
