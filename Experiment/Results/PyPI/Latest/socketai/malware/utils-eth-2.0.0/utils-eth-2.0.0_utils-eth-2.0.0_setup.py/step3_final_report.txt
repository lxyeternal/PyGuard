  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script configuring dependencies, metadata, and reading a static README file.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; static data in setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or dynamic input processing.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from file read into setup configuration; no untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static dependencies, metadata, and file reading. It does not execute dynamic code, handle untrusted input, or contain obfuscated segments. All dependencies are version-restricted and standard. No network activity, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's structure and content are consistent with benign package configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
