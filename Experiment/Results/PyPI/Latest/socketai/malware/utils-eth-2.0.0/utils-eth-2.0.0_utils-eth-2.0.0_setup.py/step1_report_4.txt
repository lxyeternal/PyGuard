{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'utils-eth', including dependencies, package data, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description, hardcoded package metadata (name, version, author, etc.), and dependencies specified in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data. No dynamic execution, network data handling, or user input processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code primarily sets up package metadata and dependencies, with no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. No network connections, no code execution, and no embedded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations using setuptools. It reads the README.md file for a long description, defines dependencies for various development tasks, and configures package metadata including name, version, author, URL, dependencies, and classifiers. All dependencies are version-restricted but do not appear suspicious. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or other risky behaviors are present. The code structure follows typical Python package setup patterns without anomalies or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely defines the package configuration for distribution. No malicious intent or security issues detected.",
