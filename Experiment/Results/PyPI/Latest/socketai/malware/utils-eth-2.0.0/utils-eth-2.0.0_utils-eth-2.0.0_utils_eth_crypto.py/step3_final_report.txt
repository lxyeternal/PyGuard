  "purpose": "A utility function to hash various input types using Keccak-256.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: primitive, hexstr, text; internally uses to_bytes for conversion.",
  "sinks": "The keccak_256 hash function outputs bytes; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> to_bytes conversion -> keccak_256 hashing -> output bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward implementation, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple wrapper for Keccak-256 hashing, accepting multiple input types and converting them to bytes via a presumed safe utility. It then hashes the data with a standard cryptographic library. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The reliance on external functions (`to_bytes`, `keccak_256`) is typical and assumed secure. The code performs a common cryptographic operation without side effects or external communication. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cryptographic utility function for hashing data with Keccak-256. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores and assessments across reports are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
