{
  "purpose": "Provides a wrapper function for Keccak-256 hashing, converting various input types to bytes before hashing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: primitive, hexstr, text (all serve as data sources for hashing).",
  "sinks": "The keccak_256 function outputs hashed bytes; potential concern if input data is maliciously crafted to cause side effects, but hashing functions are generally safe.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> to_bytes conversion -> keccak_256 hashing -> output bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation detected. The code relies on external conversion and hashing libraries, which are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple wrapper function that converts various input types into bytes via to_bytes, then hashes the result using the keccak_256 function from an external library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects. The only potential concern would be if to_bytes or keccak_256 have vulnerabilities or are used maliciously, but these are standard cryptographic operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for hashing with Keccak-256, with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for cryptographic operations.",
