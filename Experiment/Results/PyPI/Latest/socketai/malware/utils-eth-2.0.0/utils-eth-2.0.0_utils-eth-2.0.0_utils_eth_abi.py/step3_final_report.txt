  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting Ethereum ABI definitions into function signatures and log topics by hashing with keccak.",
  "sources": "ABI components, function names, input types, event signatures",
  "sinks": "keccak hashing function used to generate signatures and topics",
  "flows": "ABI data -> string representations -> keccak hash -> 4-byte selectors or log topics",
  "anomalies": "Unnecessary 'del' statement in 'collapse_if_tuple' (not malicious), no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code processes Ethereum ABI data structures to produce function signatures and event topics via string manipulation and cryptographic hashing. It performs standard operations aligned with Ethereum tooling. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of 'keccak' is standard for generating function selectors and event topics. The 'del' statement in 'collapse_if_tuple' is unnecessary but not harmful. The code does not handle external untrusted data beyond input dictionaries, nor does it perform network or file operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's benign, utility nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Ethereum ABI utility module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It performs safe, well-understood operations. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its behavior.",
