  "conclusion": "The primary security issue is the clandestine transmission of cryptographic keys to an external, suspicious domain via the 'requests.post' call during 'from_key' invocation. This behavior indicates a significant data exfiltration vector, justifying high malware and risk scores. The rest of the code is utility and validation functions with no malicious intent. Immediate review and removal or safeguarding of this network call are recommended."
