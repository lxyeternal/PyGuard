{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for validation errors.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class simply declares an exception type without any logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and typical for defining custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom exception 'ValidationError' inheriting from Python's built-in 'Exception'. It contains a docstring explaining its purpose and an empty 'pass' statement, indicating no additional logic. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues. It is a standard pattern for custom exceptions in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign definition of a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks.",
