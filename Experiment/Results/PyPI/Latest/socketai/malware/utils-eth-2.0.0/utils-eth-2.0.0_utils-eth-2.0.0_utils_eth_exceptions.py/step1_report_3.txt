  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the class is a simple exception definition",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class named ValidationError inheriting from Exception. It includes a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no external data inputs, no function calls, or dynamic code execution. The class simply serves as a specific exception type, which is standard in Python. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present, and the code appears to be a normal exception class definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
