  "sinks": "No data sinks or data processing occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow; this is just a class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'ValidationError' inheriting from 'Exception'. It includes a docstring explaining its purpose and a 'pass' statement indicating an empty class body. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. The code is simple, standard Python for custom exception creation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, harmless class definition for handling validation errors. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
