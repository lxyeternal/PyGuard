  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines a custom exception class `ValidationError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n   - The code contains only a class with a docstring and a `pass` statement, serving as a marker for validation errors elsewhere in the codebase.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - There are no logical errors or flaws in the code. The class is straightforward and standard.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of this code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign, standard nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - Since the code is purely a class definition with no logic, data handling, or external interactions, there's no basis for assigning any malware or security risk scores above zero.\n   - The code does not perform any obfuscation or malicious activity.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that this is a benign, standard pattern for custom exceptions.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code is a straightforward, typical pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n- There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The high confidence score (1) is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- Maintain high confidence in the benign nature of this code snippet.",
