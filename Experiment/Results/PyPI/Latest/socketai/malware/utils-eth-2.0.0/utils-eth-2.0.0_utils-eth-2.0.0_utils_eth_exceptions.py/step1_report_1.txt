  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing occurring",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a subclass of Exception with a docstring, and contains a pass statement. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or contain any code that could be malicious. The class is intended for use elsewhere in a larger codebase to signal validation failures. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign definition of a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks.",
