  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class 'ValidationError' for validation error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definition; no external data sources or input reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class declaration without dynamic behavior or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with a docstring and pass statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python class for a custom exception. It contains no logic, data handling, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present. The class serves solely as a marker for validation errors. The code's simplicity and clarity support a high confidence in its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
