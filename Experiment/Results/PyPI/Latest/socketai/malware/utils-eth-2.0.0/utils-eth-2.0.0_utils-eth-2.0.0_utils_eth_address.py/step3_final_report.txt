  "purpose": "Ethereum address validation, normalization, and checksum formatting utility functions.",
  "sources": "Regex matching for hex addresses, input parameters in functions, cryptographic keccak hashing for checksum calculation.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; functions process and return address strings or bytes, primarily for validation and formatting.",
  "flows": "Input address data flows through validation functions, then to normalization or checksum functions, with cryptographic hashing involved in checksum creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Ethereum address validation techniques, including regex for hex addresses, length checks for binary addresses, and keccak hashing for checksum addresses. It handles various address formats robustly, with proper input validation and error handling. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. The cryptographic functions are used appropriately for checksum generation. All functions perform expected operations without malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility for Ethereum address handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
