  "purpose": "Utility functions for validating, normalizing, and converting Ethereum addresses in various formats.",
  "sources": "Function inputs and external module functions such as is_text, is_bytes, to_hex, keccak, decode_hex, encode_hex, remove_0x_prefix.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; address validation and conversion functions, no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input values pass through validation functions, normalization, and checksum conversion, with no data being sent externally or stored.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The regular expressions and string manipulations appear standard for address validation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides multiple validation and normalization functions for Ethereum addresses, including regex checks, length checks, and checksum formatting. It uses standard cryptographic hashing (keccak) for checksum address generation, with no data leakage or malicious injection points. The functions operate on input parameters with validation, and do not execute external commands or network operations. The code appears to follow best practices for address handling and includes proper error handling. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured utility module for address validation and formatting without any signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
