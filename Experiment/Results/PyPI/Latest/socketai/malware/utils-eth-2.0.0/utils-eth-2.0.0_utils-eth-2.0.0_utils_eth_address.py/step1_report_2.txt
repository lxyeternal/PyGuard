{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling Ethereum addresses, including validation, normalization, and conversion between formats.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters such as 'value', 'left', 'right', and potentially external modules like 'is_text', 'is_bytes'.",
  "sinks": "Functions such as 'to_normalized_address', 'to_canonical_address', and 'to_checksum_address' process input to produce addresses; the only potential sink is the use of 'keccak' hash function for address checksum calculation.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation functions (is_address, is_hex_address, etc.) to normalization or conversion functions (to_normalized_address, to_checksum_address), with no external network or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The code strictly performs address validation and formatting tasks without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically validates, normalizes, and converts Ethereum addresses, utilizing regex and type checks. No external system calls, network requests, or data leaks are present. The 'keccak' function is used for checksum calculations, which is standard in Ethereum address formatting. The functions enforce address correctness and formatting but do not perform any malicious operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This module performs address validation, normalization, and conversion in a standard, benign manner. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward utility library for Ethereum address handling.",
