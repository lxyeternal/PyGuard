{
  "purpose": "The code imports various utility modules and functions from the 'eth-utils' library for use in blockchain and Ethereum-related operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version from 'pkg_resources.get_distribution' and imports multiple modules and functions from internal package components.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are evident in this code snippet; no untrusted data processing or external communication occurs here.",
  "flows": "The code flows include importing modules and functions, and retrieving the package version, which does not involve data from untrusted sources or affect system state.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The version retrieval depends on installed package metadata but is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily concerned with importing various utility functions and modules necessary for Ethereum-related operations. It includes a version check that reads package info from the environment. The only noteworthy action is a warning emitted if running under Python 2, which is a standard deprecation warning. There are no signs of malicious code, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code structure and imports are typical for a utility library. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard initialization or import module for a utility library, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It performs standard imports and a version check with a deprecation warning for Python 2. Overall, it is safe based on the provided snippet.",
