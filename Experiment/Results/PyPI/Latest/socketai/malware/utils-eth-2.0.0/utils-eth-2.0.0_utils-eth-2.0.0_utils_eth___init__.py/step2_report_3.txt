  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard import statements for utility functions related to Ethereum, with no untrusted input handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows involving untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** Only the deprecation warning for Python 2, which is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward initialization script with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing utility functions and version info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or data processing involving untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies:** Standard deprecation warning.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, no dynamic code execution, no network or file operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on imports and version retrieval.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or system actions.\n- **Anomalies:** Standard deprecation warning.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Routine setup code with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar import and version info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Standard warning.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern of imports and version check.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Slightly higher confidence in deprecation warning, but still standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; only a warning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — the risk score is very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on zero, which is correct. The code performs no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports; the code is straightforward and transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** All are zero or near-zero, as the code is purely for package setup and import management, with no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The code is a standard package initialization script, with no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no handling of untrusted data, and no obfuscation.\n- The only notable aspect is the deprecation warning for Python 2, which is benign and common in legacy code.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the analysis provided and the nature of the code. No changes are necessary; the scores accurately reflect the benign, standard nature of this code snippet.",
