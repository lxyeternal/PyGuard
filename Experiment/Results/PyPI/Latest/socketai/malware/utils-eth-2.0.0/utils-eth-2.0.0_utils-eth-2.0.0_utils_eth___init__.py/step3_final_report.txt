{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the 'eth-utils' library by importing various utility modules and functions, and retrieves the package version.",
  "sources": "Static import statements for utility functions and modules; package version retrieval via pkg_resources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external communication, or data leaks; no dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Imports and version check occur at module load; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Standard deprecation warning for Python 2 support; no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization script with only import statements and a version retrieval. It issues a benign deprecation warning for legacy Python support. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The code's purpose is purely to set up the package environment, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for a utility library related to Ethereum. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal risk score (0.1) assigned in one report reflects the deprecation warning, which is non-threatening. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
