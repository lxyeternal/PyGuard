  "purpose": "Import the function 'send_to_webhook' from a local module, likely for later use in sending data externally.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data reading occurs here.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the 'send_to_webhook' function if invoked later, which could send data externally.",
  "flows": "Import statement (source) to subsequent code where 'send_to_webhook' is called (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import of a function from a local module. No data is read, no network activity occurs in this line. All reports correctly identify this as benign. The confidence in benign nature is high (0.9-1). The potential for malicious activity depends on how 'send_to_webhook' is used later, but this cannot be determined from this snippet. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern based solely on this import statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. Any security concerns depend on subsequent usage of 'send_to_webhook', which is not shown here. The scores should remain at malware 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk approximately 0.1.",
