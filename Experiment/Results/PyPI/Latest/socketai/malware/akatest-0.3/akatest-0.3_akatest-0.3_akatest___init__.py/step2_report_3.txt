  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, the appropriateness of the scores, and any logical inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a simple import statement: `from .send_webhook import send_to_webhook`.\n- None mention actual usage of `send_to_webhook`, only the import.\n- No evidence of data flow, network activity, or malicious behavior is presented.\n- The code snippet is minimal and standard Python practice.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Issues in the Code:\n\n- **Issue presence:** The reports correctly identify that the code is just an import statement. There are no issues such as obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks in this line.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code snippet itself.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n\n- **Consistency:** All reports agree that this is a benign import statement.\n- **Potential oversight:** Some reports mention the potential for `send_webhook` to be a sink if invoked later, but this is speculative and not relevant to this import line alone.\n- **No overreach:** The reports do not claim malicious activity solely based on import, which is correct.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n\n- **Confidence scores:** Mostly high (0.9 or 1), which seems appropriate given the minimal code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security risk scores:** Very low (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n\n- No evidence of malicious activity or security issues. Scores above 0.5 are unjustified here.\n- The highest risk score is 0.1, which is appropriate.\n\n### Malware Score:\n\n- Since no malicious activity is evident, malware scores of 0 are correct.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n\n- The reports do not assume malicious intent; they recognize the benign nature.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are made based on assumptions; only potential future concerns are mentioned, which are speculative.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the evidence.**\n- **No modifications needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Personal Expert Estimate (Post-Review):\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, based on potential future misuse, but not justified solely by import)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified. No further action or escalation is necessary based on this snippet.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep scores as they are, with a malware and obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score.",
