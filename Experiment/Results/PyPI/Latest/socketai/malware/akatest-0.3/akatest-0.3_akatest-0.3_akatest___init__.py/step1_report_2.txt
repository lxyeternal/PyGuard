  "purpose": "Importing the function 'send_to_webhook' from a local module 'send_webhook'.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are explicitly present in this line.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are evident in this single line.",
  "flows": "No data flows are demonstrated in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code, are present in this line.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of a specific function from a local module, which is common in Python projects. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity based solely on this line. Without additional context or implementation details of 'send_webhook', it cannot be determined if the functionality is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement without any apparent malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger module that may handle webhook communications, but on its own, it does not pose security risks.",
