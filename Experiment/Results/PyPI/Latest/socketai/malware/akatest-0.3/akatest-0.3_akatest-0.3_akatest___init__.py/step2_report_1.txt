  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the issues in the code:**\n   - All reports are based on a single import statement:\n     ```python\n     from .send_webhook import send_to_webhook\n     ```\n   - This line by itself only imports a function; it does not execute any code, send data, or perform network activity.\n   - There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation in this line.\n   - Therefore, **no issues are present in the code** itself.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent in stating that this is a benign import statement.\n   - They correctly note that the actual behavior depends on how `send_to_webhook` is used elsewhere.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in these assessments.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1), which is reasonable given the import's benign nature.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), appropriate for such straightforward code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the content.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code only imports a function, and there's no evidence of malicious activity, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The potential for misuse depends entirely on subsequent code that calls `send_to_webhook`, which is not present here.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain very low or zero.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied by this import statement.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize that the actual behavior depends on later code.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard import statement.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 or 0 (very low, just a benign import)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThis code snippet is benign. Any potential security concern depends on how `send_to_webhook` is used later, but from this line alone, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
