  "review": "Let's systematically analyze these reports and the code snippet:\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\nfrom .send_webhook import send_to_webhook\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is a straightforward import statement importing `send_to_webhook` from a local module `send_webhook`.\n- No data is being sent, received, or processed in this line.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code itself does not contain malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. It is a standard import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**Report 1-4:**  \n- All these reports correctly identify that this is a simple import statement.\n- They correctly note that no malicious behavior or security risk is evident from this line alone.\n- Their confidence scores are high (0.9 or 1), which seems appropriate given the minimal code.\n- Malware scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1 or 0), which is reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- The report suggests that `send_webhook` \"likely\" is used to send data externally, and that the sink could be the function itself.\n- It notes that no data is sent in this snippet, so no malicious activity is demonstrated.\n- The confidence score (0.7) reflects some suspicion based on the function's purpose, but it correctly states that the actual behavior depends on subsequent code.\n- The security risk score is 0.1, which is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; none overstate the risk.\n- They correctly identify that the import alone is benign.\n- No report assumes malicious intent beyond the potential for misuse, which is appropriate.\n\n### Scores Justification:\n- Malware scores are all 0, which is correct.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting that the code is benign in isolation.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The overall assessment should remain that this code is benign.\n- The potential for malicious activity depends on how `send_to_webhook` is used elsewhere, but no evidence here suggests malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since the function could be misused later, but there's no evidence in this snippet)  \n- **Potentially suspicious behavior:** None observed in this import statement alone.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a standard import statement with no malicious or security concerns evident from the provided code and reports. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
