{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'send_to_webhook' from a local module 'send_webhook', likely used to send data to an external webhook endpoint.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'send_webhook'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the 'send_to_webhook' function, which may send data externally.",
  "flows": "The flow would be from calling 'send_to_webhook' with some data (not shown), which could send data externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet is minimal, but the presence of 'send_webhook' suggests possible external data transmission. No credentials or data handling shown here.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function intended for sending data to a webhook. Since no actual data is sent in this snippet, and only an import statement is present, there is no evidence of malicious activity or data leaks. The actual behavior depends on how 'send_to_webhook' is used elsewhere, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal import statement with no malicious behavior or security issues evident in the snippet. The functionality depends on subsequent code, but nothing suspicious is observable here.",
