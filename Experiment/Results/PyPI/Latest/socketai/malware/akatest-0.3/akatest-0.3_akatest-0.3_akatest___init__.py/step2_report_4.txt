  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step, considering the provided code and the context.\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   The code is a straightforward import statement:\n   ```python\n   from .send_webhook import send_to_webhook\n   ```\n   There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or embedded malicious payloads. The import is standard practice in Python modules.\n\n2. **Assessment of Each Report:**\n\n   - **Reports 1-4:**\n     All these reports agree that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious activity or security risk evident from this line alone. Their confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), and they correctly identify that no data flows, sinks, or anomalies are present in this snippet.\n\n   - **Report 5:**\n     This report notes that `send_webhook` may be used to send data externally, which could be a potential sink. However, it emphasizes that the current snippet only contains an import statement and no actual data transmission occurs here. The confidence level is lower (0.7), which is appropriate given the potential for misuse in subsequent code.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Issues in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding this import statement.\n   - They appropriately avoid assuming malicious intent solely based on the import.\n   - No report suggests that the code is obfuscated or contains hidden payloads, which is correct.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. Importing a function does not imply malicious intent.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Mostly low (0.1), reflecting minimal concern. Report 5 assigns 0.1, considering potential future misuse, which is reasonable.\n\n5. **Overall Risk and Malware Evaluation:**\n   - The import alone does not pose a security threat.\n   - The actual risk depends on how `send_to_webhook` is used elsewhere in the codebase.\n   - No evidence suggests malicious activity or vulnerabilities based solely on this import statement.\n\n6. **Recommendations:**\n   - Continue monitoring how `send_to_webhook` is used.\n   - Ensure that any data sent via this function is properly validated and sanitized.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                                  |\n|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                   | No malicious behavior in import statement.                       |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                   | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.               |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1                 | Minimal risk; potential misuse depends on subsequent code.     |\n\n**Summary:**\nThe import statement is standard, with no inherent security issues. The risk and malware scores should remain at zero, with a very low security risk score (around 0.1) to account for potential misuse elsewhere.",
