  "purpose": "Import the function send_to_webhook from the local module send_webhook.",
  "sources": "The import statement is a static code operation; no dynamic input source is present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "The import itself does not constitute a sink; however, if send_to_webhook is used elsewhere with untrusted data, it could be relevant.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this single line; it is an import statement without execution of data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module, which is a common pattern. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this single import statement. The security implications depend on how send_to_webhook is used elsewhere, but this line alone is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code line is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It does not pose any risk by itself.",
