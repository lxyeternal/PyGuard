{
  "purpose": "The setup.py defines a custom install command that, after installation, imports and calls send_to_webhook() from akatest.send_webhook, triggering a network request post-installation.",
  "sources": "The import of send_to_webhook() and its invocation after package installation.",
  "sinks": "The send_to_webhook() function likely performs network communication, potentially sending data externally.",
  "flows": "Post-installation, the code executes send_to_webhook(), which may involve network transmission of data.",
  "anomalies": "The automatic invocation of an external network request during installation without user consent or safeguards; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with a custom install command that triggers send_to_webhook() after setup. No malicious code or obfuscation is visible; the main concern is the external network call which depends entirely on the implementation of send_to_webhook(). The pattern could be benign telemetry or malicious data exfiltration. The malware score is low (around 0.2), reflecting no direct malicious code but potential misuse. The security risk score is moderate (~0.4), considering the behavior of executing an external webhook post-install. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.8), given the code's clarity and the external dependency.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but employs a pattern (post-install webhook call) that could be exploited for malicious purposes depending on send_to_webhook()'s implementation. Without further information, the risk remains moderate, and scores are appropriately conservative.",
