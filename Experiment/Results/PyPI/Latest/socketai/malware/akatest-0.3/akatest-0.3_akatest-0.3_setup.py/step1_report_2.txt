{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script configures the package installation process, including a custom post-install step that calls a webhook function.",
  "sources": "The script reads package metadata, dependencies, and invokes the send_to_webhook function from akatest.send_webhook during installation.",
  "sinks": "The send_to_webhook function is called after installation, potentially sending data to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "The script imports and executes send_to_webhook during the custom install command, which occurs after package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a post-install hook to invoke external network activity (send_to_webhook) without validation, and the external function's implementation is unknown. No other suspicious or malicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py with a custom install class that runs an external webhook call after installation. The webhook invocation could be used maliciously if send_to_webhook is designed to exfiltrate data or perform unwanted network activity. However, the code itself does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The main concern is the external call in the post-install step, which may be used for tracking or malicious purposes depending on send_to_webhook's implementation. No malicious code or malware signatures are directly present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script performs standard package setup with a post-install hook that calls an external webhook. While this is not inherently malicious, the external network activity triggered during installation warrants caution. Without examining send_to_webhook, we cannot fully assess its intent, but the pattern itself is typical of tracking or potentially malicious behavior depending on context.",
