  "purpose": "To customize the package installation process by executing a webhook call after installation.",
  "sources": "Import statement within the PostInstallCommand class: from akatest.send_webhook import send_to_webhook",
  "sinks": "Execution of send_to_webhook() function which likely makes a network request",
  "flows": "After package installation, the run() method calls send_to_webhook(), triggering potential network activity",
  "anomalies": "Use of a post-install hook to automatically invoke a webhook call without user consent or explicit control, which could be used maliciously to signal installation or leak data",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation process, automatically imports and executes a function send_to_webhook(). This behavior occurs without explicit user interaction or confirmation. The purpose appears to be to notify or trigger an external webhook upon package installation. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns, but the automatic external call during installation could be exploited for malicious tracking or signaling if the send_to_webhook() function contacts a malicious server. The package itself is simple and does not contain malicious code; however, its behavior of triggering external network activity post-installation is a privacy concern and could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to automatically call an external webhook after installation, which can be used for legitimate purposes or malicious tracking. It does not contain direct malware but employs potentially intrusive behavior that warrants caution. The main concern is the automatic external request triggered without user consent.",
