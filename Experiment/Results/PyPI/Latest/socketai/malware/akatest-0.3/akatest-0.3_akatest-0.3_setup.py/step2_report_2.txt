  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The setup.py defines a custom install command (`PostInstallCommand`) that, after performing the standard installation, imports and calls `send_to_webhook()` from `akatest.send_webhook`.\n- The code itself is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The main concern is that after installation, an external function is invoked that likely performs network communication.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code **does** execute a function (`send_to_webhook()`) after installation.\n- The actual behavior of `send_to_webhook()` is unknown; it could be benign or malicious.\n- No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are visible in this snippet.\n- The pattern of triggering network activity post-installation is suspicious but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Post-install webhook call.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the post-install hook and its potential to perform network communication. Notes that maliciousness depends on `send_to_webhook` implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.2, SecurityRisk 0.3, Confidence 0.7.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The malware score is low, acknowledging the potential but unconfirmed malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the external network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.2, SecurityRisk 0.3, Confidence 0.7.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1; the low malware score reflects uncertainty about malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the potential for malicious behavior but notes no malicious code directly.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.2, SecurityRisk 0.4, Confidence 0.7.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score; still reasonable given the external call.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights the automatic call to an external webhook post-installation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.4, Confidence 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower malware score, considering no direct malicious code but acknowledging the intrusive behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, notes the potential for malicious use but no direct evidence.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.4, SecurityRisk 0.45, Confidence 0.7.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher malware score, possibly overestimating risk without concrete evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- All reports agree that the main concern is the invocation of `send_to_webhook()` post-install.\n- The actual maliciousness hinges entirely on the implementation of `send_to_webhook()`, which is not provided.\n- The current malware scores are low (mostly 0.2), reflecting uncertainty.\n- The security risk scores are moderate (~0.3-0.45), justified by the potential for malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable given the information. The main point is that without inspecting `send_to_webhook()`, we cannot confirm malicious intent.\n- A higher malware score would only be justified if evidence of malicious behavior is found.\n- The overall pattern is suspicious but not definitively malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** I would assign a **0.2** to **0.3**, depending on whether the function's implementation is benign or malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Around **0.3-0.4**, considering the automatic external call during install.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is not inherently malicious but employs a pattern (post-install webhook trigger) that could be exploited for malicious purposes.\n- The actual risk depends entirely on the implementation of `send_to_webhook()`.\n- Given the available information, I would rate:\n  - **Malware:** 0.2\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.35\n\nThis balances the potential for misuse with the lack of concrete malicious evidence in the code snippet.",
