{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script customizes the installation process of a Python package to include a post-installation hook that triggers a webhook call.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules (subprocess, setuptools) and reads the README.md file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "The send_to_webhook function is imported and called after installation, which may perform network communication.",
  "flows": "After installation, the run method calls send_to_webhook, which likely sends data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom install command to invoke send_to_webhook after installation; no hardcoded credentials or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that executes the standard install process and then calls a function from akatest.send_webhook. This function's purpose appears to be to send a webhook request, which is a common operation but could be malicious if misused. The code itself does not contain network code; it relies on the external send_to_webhook function. The package metadata is standard. No suspicious or malicious code such as credential theft, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident in this script. The pattern of triggering a webhook post-install could be used for benign telemetry or, if the send_webhook function is malicious, for malicious data exfiltration. Without the implementation of send_to_webhook, the potential maliciousness cannot be fully determined, but the script itself is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py file implements a post-install hook that calls an external function to send a webhook. The code appears to be benign and standard in structure; however, the behavior of send_to_webhook depends on its implementation. If the function performs network communication with an external server, it could be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration, but this cannot be confirmed from this script alone.",
