  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Code Summary & Behavior:**\n- The setup.py defines a custom install command (`PostInstallCommand`) that, after executing the standard installation, imports and calls `send_to_webhook()` from `akatest.send_webhook`.\n- This function call occurs immediately after installation, with no apparent safeguards or user prompts.\n- The actual implementation of `send_to_webhook()` is unknown; it likely performs a network request to a webhook URL.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code does **not** contain any hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The behavior of `send_to_webhook()` is external and unknown, so the potential for malicious activity depends entirely on its implementation.\n- The pattern of triggering network activity during installation can be considered intrusive or suspicious, especially if the function is malicious or used for tracking.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Potential privacy/security concern:** Automatically executing network requests during package installation can be exploited for malicious tracking or data exfiltration.\n- **Lack of safeguards:** No user consent, confirmation, or configuration options are provided before the webhook call.\n- **Dependence on external implementation:** The security implications hinge on `send_to_webhook()`'s behavior, which is not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Scores Review:\n**Malware Score:**\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0.2 or 0.4, citing the potential for malicious network activity.\n- Given the code pattern, the malware risk is **not inherent** but **dependent** on `send_to_webhook()`'s implementation.\n- **My assessment:** I agree with a malware score around **0.2-0.3**, assuming the function is benign unless proven otherwise.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n**Risk Score:**\n- The reports give a risk score ranging from 0.3 to 0.45.\n- Considering the behavior (automatic network call post-install), I think a risk score of **0.4** is justified, especially if the external function is malicious or tracking.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Comments:\n- **Claims about maliciousness:** The reports correctly state that the code itself isn't malicious but could be used maliciously depending on `send_to_webhook()`.\n- **Assumptions:** No assumptions are made beyond the external function’s behavior, which is appropriate.\n- **Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the described behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Overall malware score:** **0.2-0.3** (moderate, depending on external implementation)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** **0.4** (due to automatic external network activity post-install)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code pattern is typical but employs a potentially intrusive post-install network call. Without inspecting `send_to_webhook()`, the risk remains moderate. The current scores are reasonable but could be slightly increased if there's suspicion of malicious intent.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.4\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's behavior.",
