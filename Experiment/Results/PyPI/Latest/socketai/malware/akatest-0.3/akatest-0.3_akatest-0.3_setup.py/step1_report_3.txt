{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script defines the installation process for the 'akatest' package, including a custom post-installation hook that calls a webhook.",
  "sources": "The script imports subprocess, setuptools modules, and a custom class for post-install actions. It also reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'send_to_webhook()' imported from 'akatest.send_webhook' is a sink, as it executes code that could potentially perform network operations or other actions.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run() method triggers 'send_to_webhook()' after the standard install process, which may execute code that sends data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "The code calls 'send_to_webhook()' immediately after installation without any apparent safeguards or checks, which could be suspicious if the function performs malicious actions. No explicit secrets or credentials are hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that executes 'send_to_webhook()' post-installation. Since 'send_to_webhook()' is imported from an external module, its behavior is unknown but could potentially perform network operations. The code itself does not contain malicious logic but relies on the imported function's implementation. The script's structure is straightforward and lacks obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. However, executing code automatically after installation could be misused for malicious purposes if the imported function is malicious. No hardcoded credentials or malicious commands are present directly in this script.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py executes a webhook call immediately after installation via an imported function, which could be used maliciously if the function is harmful. There are no obvious malicious behaviors or suspicious code patterns directly in this file, but the potential for malicious behavior depends on the implementation of 'send_to_webhook'.",
