{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'akatest' package, including a custom post-installation hook to send a webhook.",
  "sources": "The 'send_to_webhook' function imported from 'akatest.send_webhook' within the PostInstallCommand.run() method.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'send_to_webhook()' after installation; potential network request to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "After installation, the code executes 'send_to_webhook()', which is a sink that likely performs an external network request.",
  "anomalies": "The script runs a function that sends data to an external webhook immediately after installation; no validation or parameter checks are visible.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation command that, upon execution, imports and calls 'send_to_webhook' from the package's submodule. This behavior triggers a network request post-installation, which could be used maliciously to leak data, confirm package installation, or execute unauthorized actions. The code itself is straightforward and adheres to standard setup patterns, but the inclusion of a webhook trigger in the post-install process is suspicious. It could be exploited for malicious purposes such as tracking or data exfiltration if the webhook URL is maliciously controlled. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or other malicious code snippets are present. The behavior relies entirely on the imported 'send_to_webhook' function, which is not shown, but its invocation is a potential security concern depending on its implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a post-install hook that sends data to an external webhook, which could be used for malicious tracking or data exfiltration. The setup is otherwise standard, but the webhook invocation warrants scrutiny due to its potential for malicious behavior.",
