  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- No code provided.\n- All fields confirm absence of code, data flows, anomalies.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scoring seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Describes a utility script reading environment variables, performing data processing.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malware detected.\n- Confidence is high (0.9), indicating trust in benign nature.\n- Security risk is low (0.2), consistent with routine code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Note:** The reasoning aligns with the evidence; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to Report 2, but with less confidence (0.3).\n- No code provided, only a description.\n- No anomalies or malware detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Note:** The low confidence is justified given the lack of code.\n\n**Reports 4 and 5:**\n- No code provided.\n- All fields indicate absence of code, data flows, anomalies.\n- Scores: all zeros, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- All reports correctly identify the absence of code and refrain from assigning unwarranted risk or malware scores.\n- The scores are consistent with the provided information.\n- The reasoning is sound; no suspicious claims are made without evidence.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is suggested.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, since no code is present or obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Remains low, reflecting the lack of evidence for security issues.\n\n### My overall estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, considering some reports are entirely absent of code)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are cautious and appropriate given the data. No changes to scores are necessary. The reasoning is justified, and the scores align with the evidence.",
