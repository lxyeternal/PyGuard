  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, network interactions, file operations, and data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network connections, environment variable access, file modifications, and data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or network inputs to sinks like network connections or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; reports lack code or show benign descriptions.",
  "analysis": "All reports without code correctly assign zero malware, obfuscated, and risk scores. Descriptions of scripts reading environment variables and performing data processing are benign, with high confidence scores (0.9) and low risk (0.2). Reports lacking code appropriately have zero scores and low confidence. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues is present. The scoring aligns with the evidence, and no anomalies are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code assessments are appropriate and consistent with the provided descriptions. All scores accurately reflect the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior. No modifications are necessary; the overall security posture is considered very low risk.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
