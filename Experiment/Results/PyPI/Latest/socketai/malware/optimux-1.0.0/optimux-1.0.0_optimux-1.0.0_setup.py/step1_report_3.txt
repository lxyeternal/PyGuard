  "purpose": "Defines a Python package setup with a custom install step that sends system information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "os.system call executing a curl command with embedded shell commands to gather system info (whoami, hostname, pwd, IP).",
  "sinks": "The curl command posts data to an external server, transmitting potentially sensitive system info.",
  "flows": "During installation, the CustomInstallCommand.run() method executes the curl command, which collects system data and sends it over the network.",
  "anomalies": "The use of os.system to run a curl command that captures and transmits system information is suspicious. Embedding shell commands within a Python script to exfiltrate data without explicit user consent is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and overrides the install command to insert a data exfiltration step during package installation. The custom run method constructs and executes a shell command that gathers sensitive system info (user, hostname, current directory, public IP) and sends it via POST request to an external URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or a backdoor mechanism. No other malicious code or backdoors are apparent outside this exfiltration step. The rest of the setup code appears standard. The use of os.system for this purpose, combined with external data transmission, is a significant security concern, especially if unintentional or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious behavior: during installation, it exfiltrates system information to an external server. This behavior is suspicious and likely malicious, indicative of a supply chain attack or backdoor. No other malicious indicators or obfuscation are present, but the exfiltration itself is a serious security risk.",
