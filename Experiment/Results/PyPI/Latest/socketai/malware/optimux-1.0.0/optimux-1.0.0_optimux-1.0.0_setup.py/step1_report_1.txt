{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom install step that sends system information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "The custom install command executes an os.system call that runs a curl command with embedded shell commands to gather system info.",
  "sinks": "The curl command posts data including 'whoami', 'hostname', 'pwd', and external IP address to a remote server.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code invokes a shell command that collects system info and sends it over the network to an external endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "The code embeds shell commands within a Python string, which executes system information collection and exfiltration during installation. No hardcoded credentials are present, but the behavior is suspicious due to automatic data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses setuptools to define package installation behavior. It overrides the 'install' command with CustomInstallCommand, which, after running the standard install process, executes a shell command via os.system. This shell command uses curl to POST system information such as username, hostname, current directory, and external IP address to a remote server. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration during package installation, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads like backdoors, but the automatic sending of system info to an external endpoint without user consent indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes a hidden malicious behavior where it exfiltrates system information during installation without user consent. This is a clear security concern and classifies as malicious activity. The code's structure and purpose suggest intentional data theft, which makes the package unsafe for use.",
