{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that overrides the default install process to execute a malicious curl command during installation.",
  "sources": "The os.system() call executing the curl command, which includes the output of whoami, hostname, pwd, and IP address commands.",
  "sinks": "The curl command sending data to an external URL, potentially exfiltrating sensitive system information.",
  "flows": "During installation, the overridden run() method calls os.system() to execute a curl POST request containing system information, sending data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() to run a command that collects and exfiltrates sensitive data without user consent; the URL to which data is sent is external and suspicious; the command constructs a JSON payload with potentially sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and defines a custom install command that, after executing the normal installation, runs a curl command to POST system information to an external URL. This behavior is embedded in the package's setup script, which is executed during installation. The URL used for data exfiltration is suspiciously external and not related to the package's purpose. The use of os.system() with embedded shell commands that include system commands (whoami, hostname, pwd, curl) indicates malicious intent to secretly gather and send system data. This constitutes a supply chain attack, as the package performs unauthorized data exfiltration during installation, potentially compromising user systems.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by secretly exfiltrating system information during installation via a custom setup command. This behavior is embedded within the setup script and is not related to the package's stated purpose. It poses a significant security risk and should be considered malicious.",
