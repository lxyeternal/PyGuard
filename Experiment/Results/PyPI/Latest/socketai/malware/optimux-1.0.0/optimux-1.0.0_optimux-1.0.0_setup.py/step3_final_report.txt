{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform a standard package installation but additionally executes a shell command to exfiltrate system information (user, hostname, current directory, external IP) to an external URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The `os.system()` call executing the `curl` command, which gathers system info via embedded shell commands (`whoami`, `hostname`, `pwd`, `curl -s ifconfig.me`).",
  "sinks": "The external URL `https://enj2782rxwxl.x.pipedream.net/` receiving the POST request containing the system info, representing data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "During the `install` process, the code runs `os.system()` with a `curl` command that collects system info and sends it to the external server, constituting a source-to-sink data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of a network request during package installation, collecting sensitive system info without user consent, using embedded shell commands within Python code, which is suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard installation process to include a command that gathers system data (`whoami`, `hostname`, `pwd`, external IP) via embedded shell commands and transmits this data to an external URL using `curl`. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation, without user notification or consent. The approach uses `os.system()` with embedded shell commands, which is insecure and suspicious. The external URL is not a standard or trusted endpoint, raising concerns about data privacy and potential malicious activity. The code's straightforward nature and the explicit data exfiltration pattern confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (0.75 to 1 for malware and security risk) are justified, with the highest being 1, reflecting a clear malicious activity. The obfuscation score is correctly 0, as the code is clear and unobfuscated. Overall, this code constitutes a malicious backdoor or supply chain attack vector, exfiltrating user/system data during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code performs unauthorized data exfiltration during package installation, which is malicious behavior. The external URL and the automatic collection of system info without user consent confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate, with the malware and security risk scores at the maximum (1.0). This package should be flagged as malicious and avoided for use.",
