{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation process that executes a network request during installation.",
  "sources": "The custom install command's run() method, specifically the os.system call executing a curl command with embedded shell commands to gather system information.",
  "sinks": "The curl command sends data to an external URL, potentially leaking system information such as username, hostname, current directory, and public IP address.",
  "flows": "The code executes a shell command during installation, capturing system info via shell commands ($()), then transmits this data over HTTP POST to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a post-install step that collects sensitive system data and transmits it without user consent or explicit notification. The use of os.system with embedded shell commands to send data is suspicious. No input validation or restrictions are evident.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines package metadata and overrides the install process with a custom command. During installation, it runs a shell command using os.system, which executes a curl request. The curl command constructs a JSON payload containing the output of system commands: whoami, hostname, pwd, and curl to ifconfig.me for IP address. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of system information during package installation. The external URL used for data transmission appears arbitrary and may be malicious. The code does not appear to perform any other malicious activity, but the behavior of collecting and sending system info without user consent is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior: it exfiltrates system information during package installation via a hidden curl request embedded in a custom install command. This action is suspicious and potentially harmful, representing a privacy violation and possible supply chain attack vector.",
