{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the main_function from a local module named your_code.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'your_code' and the 'main_function' within it.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of main_function() could be a sink if the function executes untrusted or malicious code.",
  "flows": "Import of 'your_code' -> execution of 'main_function()'",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module 'your_code' and calls its 'main_function'. There are no suspicious patterns or hidden behaviors. The code's simplicity limits the ability to assess malicious intent without examining 'your_code'. Since it relies on a local module, the security depends on the contents of 'your_code'. No hardcoded credentials, malicious constructs, or obfuscation are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. However, since the behavior of 'main_function' depends on the external module, the overall security cannot be fully assessed without inspecting 'your_code'. The code itself appears benign.",
