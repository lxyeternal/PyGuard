{
  "purpose": "Minimal code imports and executes 'main_function' from a local module, typical in modular Python applications.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.your_code' module, calling 'main_function()'. No external inputs or data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main_function' could be a sink if it performs malicious actions, but the code snippet itself does not contain any such sinks.",
  "flows": "Import from '.your_code' (source) to execution of 'main_function' (sink). The actual behavior depends on the implementation of 'your_code.main_function'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in the code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing and executing a function from a local module. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies are present. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'your_code.main_function', which is outside the scope of this snippet. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately set to 0. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) reflects the benign appearance but acknowledges the unknown external code. Confidence in the benign assessment is moderate, given the minimal code and lack of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign and minimal. The main security concern hinges on the contents of 'your_code.main_function', which cannot be assessed here. Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malware or obfuscation, and the security risk is low.",
