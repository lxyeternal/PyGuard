{
  "purpose": "This code appears to import and execute a main_function from a local module named your_code.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module your_code during import and function execution.",
  "sinks": "The execution of main_function could potentially be a sink if the function contains malicious code, but the code itself does not specify external sinks.",
  "flows": "The code imports your_code and executes main_function, which could be a source of untrusted actions depending on the implementation of main_function.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; there are no obvious anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The use of a relative import could indicate modular design, but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function from a relative module and executes it directly. No other code, inputs, or external data sources are shown. Without inspecting the contents of your_code, it's impossible to determine if main_function is malicious. The structure is standard, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns in this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code fragment, there are no explicit malicious behaviors or security risks. The code's safety heavily depends on the implementation of your_code.main_function. The minimal and straightforward nature suggests low suspicion, but further analysis of your_code is needed for comprehensive security assessment.",
