{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the 'main_function' from a local module named 'your_code'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports and calls a function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'main_function', which is defined externally; potential sinks depend on that function's implementation, but from this code alone, there are no direct sinks.",
  "flows": "There is a straightforward flow: import 'main_function' from local module -> execute 'main_function'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual code are visible here.",
  "analysis": "The snippet imports a function from a relative module and executes it. Without insight into 'your_code', no malicious activity can be confirmed or ruled out. The structure is simple and typical for modular Python code. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The actual security risk depends on the content of 'your_code', but this snippet alone appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. It is a standard import-and-execute pattern with no signs of malware or security issues.",
