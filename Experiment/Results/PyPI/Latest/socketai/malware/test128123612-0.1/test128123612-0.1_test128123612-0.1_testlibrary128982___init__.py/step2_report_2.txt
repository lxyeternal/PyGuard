  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is a minimal import and execution pattern:\n  ```python\n  from .your_code import main_function\n  main_function()\n  ```\n- There are no direct signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies within this snippet.\n- The security risk and malware scores are all zero or very low, reflecting the absence of explicit malicious behavior.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or reasoning issues**\n\n- The reports correctly note that the actual security implications depend heavily on the implementation of `your_code.main_function`.\n- They acknowledge the limitations of analyzing only this snippet.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident; the assessments are cautious and appropriate.\n\n**Step 3: Review and suggest score adjustments**\n\n- The confidence levels are mostly moderate (0.4 to 0.7), which is reasonable given the limited information.\n- The malware scores are all zero, consistent with the absence of evident malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are low, aligning with the minimal code structure.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since the code itself is benign and no suspicious patterns are present, elevating the risk score above 0.5 isn't justified.\n- The risk heavily depends on the contents of `your_code`, which are unknown.\n- Without evidence of malicious behavior, the risk scores should remain low.\n\n**Step 5: Malware score considerations**\n\n- The malware score is zero across reports, which is appropriate.\n- No signs of malicious actions, such as code injection, obfuscation, or network activity, are indicated.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they only state that the security depends on the implementation of `your_code`.\n- This cautious approach is correct.\n\n**Step 7: Ensure consistency of scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: low malware, low obfuscation, and low security risk.\n- Confidence levels are moderate, reflecting uncertainty due to lack of implementation details.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n  *No evidence of malicious activity in the snippet.*\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n  *Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.*\n\n- **Risk:** 0.2  \n  *Low risk, given the minimal code and dependence on external module content.*\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code snippet itself appears benign and straightforward. The security implications hinge entirely on the contents of `your_code.main_function`, which are unknown. Based on the provided reports and analysis, the current scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary unless further information about `your_code` is available.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores for malware and obfuscation, with a slightly elevated but still low risk score (around 0.2), reflecting the need for further inspection of the external module's content before making definitive security judgments.",
