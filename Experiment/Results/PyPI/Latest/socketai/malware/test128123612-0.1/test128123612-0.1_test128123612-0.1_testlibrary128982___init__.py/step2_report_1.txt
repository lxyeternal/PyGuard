  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: importing `main_function` from a local module `your_code` and executing it.\n- The reports correctly note that without inspecting `your_code`, we cannot determine if `main_function` is malicious.\n- The code itself is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or anomalies.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of direct malicious indicators.\n- The confidence levels vary from 0.4 to 0.7, which is reasonable given the limited information.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code snippet is minimal and does not contain any issues or vulnerabilities by itself.\n   - The reports correctly state that the actual risk depends on the implementation of `your_code.main_function`.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - No logical errors are evident. The reports are cautious and accurate.\n   - They correctly avoid assuming malicious intent solely based on the import and execution pattern.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - Malware score: consistently 0, appropriate given the code.\n   - Obfuscated score: 0, accurate.\n   - Security risk: low (~0.1-0.2), justified since the code is benign but depends on external code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are below 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - The minimal code and lack of suspicious patterns justify low risk.\n\n5. **Malware score justification:**\n   - Since the code merely imports and executes a function, and there's no evidence of malicious behavior, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n   - The risk depends entirely on `your_code`, which is outside the scope here.\n\n6. **Challenging assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly state that further analysis of `your_code` is necessary.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the described code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code in the snippet)\n- **Risk:** 0.1-0.2 (low, given the minimal code and dependency on external code)\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n- If the analysis could include static analysis of `your_code`, the scores might be refined further.\n- For now, the current scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and minimal. The security risk is low, and there's no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The main concern is the content of `your_code`, which cannot be assessed here.**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the current understanding based solely on the provided snippet.",
