  "purpose": "Import and execute the main_function from a local module named your_code.",

  "flows": "Import from local module -> execution of main_function()",
  "anomalies": "Usage of relative import, which could obscure the origin of the module, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports main_function from a local module your_code using relative import syntax. It then executes main_function(). There are no visible inputs, network operations, or data handling in this snippet. The code is minimal and straightforward. Without the content of your_code, it is impossible to assess malicious behavior, but the snippet itself is not suspicious. It simply runs a function from a local module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, straightforward import and execution of a local function. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet alone. It appears benign, assuming the imported function is safe.",
