  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the accuracy of their observations, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is minimal, only importing and executing `main_function` from a local module `your_code`.\n- No external inputs, network calls, or other suspicious patterns are visible.\n- The actual security risk hinges entirely on the contents of `your_code.main_function`, which is unknown here.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or anomalies are evident in the snippet itself.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- The code **does not** contain any malicious code or vulnerabilities **by itself**.\n- The potential risk depends on the implementation of `your_code.main_function`.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- **Overgeneralization:** All reports conclude that the code is benign based solely on the snippet. While this is technically correct, they do not emphasize that the actual risk depends on the external module's implementation.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the code snippet alone.\n  - Security risk scores are mostly 0.1 or 0.2, which seem reasonable given the minimal code.\n  - Confidence levels vary but are generally moderate, reflecting uncertainty about the external module.\n\n### Recommendations on scores:\n\n- **Malware scores:** Should remain at 0 unless evidence suggests malicious behavior in `your_code`.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correctly 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the uncertainty, 0.1–0.2 seems appropriate, but could be slightly higher if the external module is untrusted.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- The current scores are all below 0.5, which aligns with the code's benign appearance.\n- If the external module `your_code` is untrusted or from an unknown source, the overall risk could be higher, but that cannot be inferred from this snippet alone.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n\n- Since the code only imports and executes a function, **malicious activity would be hidden inside `your_code.main_function`**.\n- The code snippet itself does **not** perform any malicious actions, so malware score remains at 0.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n\n- The reports assume the code is safe because it looks benign, which is reasonable.\n- They correctly note that the actual security implications depend on the implementation of `your_code.main_function`.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: minimal, benign code with unknown external behavior.\n- Confidence levels reflect uncertainty, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious activity in the snippet.\n\n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Estimated risk score:** **0.1–0.2** — low, given the minimal code and unknown external implementation.\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate in their assessment that the code appears benign. The primary concern is the external module `your_code`, which could contain malicious code, but that cannot be determined from this snippet alone. The scores assigned are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary unless further information about `your_code` is provided.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard pattern for modular Python applications. Its security implications depend entirely on the implementation of `your_code.main_function`. Without that, the code itself appears safe, with minimal risk and no malware indications.",
