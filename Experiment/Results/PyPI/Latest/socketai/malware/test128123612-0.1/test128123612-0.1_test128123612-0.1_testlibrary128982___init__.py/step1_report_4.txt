  "purpose": "Import and execute the main_function from the local your_code module.",
  "sources": "The code imports main_function from a local module 'your_code'.",
  "sinks": "Calling main_function() as the sink; potential execution point.",
  "flows": "Import from local module -> call main_function()",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only importing and executing a function; no anomalies detected directly.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function named main_function from a local module 'your_code' and executes it immediately. Since 'your_code' is a local module, the content of main_function is unknown, which limits the ability to analyze potential malicious behavior directly. The structure is straightforward, with no apparent obfuscation or suspicious code patterns. There are no hardcoded secrets, input/output handling, or external network calls visible here. Without the implementation of main_function, we cannot determine if malicious actions are performed. The code itself is minimal and appears typical for executing a main routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply imports and executes a function from a local module. No malicious behavior or security issues can be determined from this snippet alone. Further analysis of 'your_code' is necessary to rule out malicious actions.",
