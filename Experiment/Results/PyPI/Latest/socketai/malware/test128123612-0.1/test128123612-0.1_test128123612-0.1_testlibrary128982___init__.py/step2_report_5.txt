  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom .your_code import main_function\n\nmain_function()\n```\n\nThis is a minimal, straightforward pattern: import a function from a local module and execute it. The security implications depend heavily on the content of `your_code.main_function`, which is not provided.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- **Presence of issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code is syntactically correct, minimal, and typical for modular Python scripts.\n\n- **Malware potential?**  \n  Not detectable from this snippet alone. The actual maliciousness depends on `main_function`'s implementation.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is clear and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk score justification?**  \n  Since the code itself is benign but relies on an external function whose behavior is unknown, the risk score should be low unless the external code is malicious.\n\n- **Malware score?**  \n  Should be zero unless there's evidence of malicious behavior in `your_code`.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### Reports 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:\n- All describe the code as minimal, straightforward, importing and executing a local function.\n- They correctly note that without inspecting `your_code`, the security assessment is incomplete.\n- The confidence scores vary between 0.4 and 0.7, which is reasonable given the lack of detailed content.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n- Security risk: 0.1 - 0.2 (reasonable, given the minimal code but unknown external code)\n- Confidence: varies, generally moderate\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The code itself is benign, so malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk is low but not zero, reflecting uncertainty about the external module.\n\n- **Should any scores be adjusted?**  \n  - For all reports, the malware score should remain at 0 unless there's evidence of malicious code in `your_code`.\n  - The obfuscated score is correctly 0.\n  - The security risk could be slightly increased if the external code is untrusted, but without evidence, staying at 0.2 or below is appropriate.\n\n- **Is there any inconsistency?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent with the code snippet.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports correctly state that the risk depends on `your_code`. No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0.1 - 0.2** |\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is benign in structure.\n- The risk is low but non-zero due to reliance on external code.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- The actual security concern hinges on the content of `your_code.main_function`, which remains unknown.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFrom this code snippet alone, **there is no evidence of malware or obfuscation**. The overall risk is minimal, assuming the external module is safe. Further analysis of `your_code` is necessary for a definitive security assessment.",
