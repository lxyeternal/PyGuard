      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing main() during installation poses a significant security risk, especially if main.py contains malicious code. The scores should be adjusted to indicate a high likelihood of malicious behavior (malware score ~0.6, security risk ~0.6), emphasizing the need for further inspection of main.py and caution in using this package."

      "obfuscated": 0.2,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a covert data exfiltration tool, collecting system info and transmitting it to suspicious external servers. While it does not execute malicious payloads, its behavior is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious in intent. The suspicious domains, data collection pattern, and encoding justify a high malware likelihood and security risk. The obfuscation is minimal, primarily base64 encoding. Overall, it poses a significant privacy and security concern, warranting a malware score of approximately 0.7, an obfuscation score of 0.2, and a risk score of 0.75."
