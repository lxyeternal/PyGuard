  "purpose": "The setup script defines a custom installation process that executes the main() function from main.py during package installation, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from main import main' and the subsequent call to main() in the run() method of CrazyInstallStrat.",
  "sinks": "The execution of main() during setup, which runs untrusted code at install time.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method executes install.run(self) followed by import main and main(), creating a source-to-sink flow where external code is run during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external code (main()) during setup, which is unconventional and potentially dangerous; no validation or sandboxing is performed before executing main().",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, after performing the standard installation, imports and executes main() from main.py. This pattern can be exploited to run malicious code if main.py is compromised. The code itself is straightforward with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The primary concern is the security risk associated with executing external code during package installation, which is a common tactic for malicious packages. The malware score should reflect the potential for malicious activity, and given the pattern, a higher score (around 0.6) is justified. The obfuscated score remains 0, and the security risk score should be elevated to reflect the danger of executing untrusted code during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing main() during installation poses a significant security risk, especially if main.py contains malicious code. The scores should be adjusted to indicate a high likelihood of malicious behavior (malware score ~0.6, security risk ~0.6), emphasizing the need for further inspection of main.py and caution in using this package.",
