  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package including a custom installation command that executes a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The import of 'main' within the run() method of the CrazyInstallStrat class.",
  "sinks": "The call to main() which could potentially execute arbitrary code from main.py.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run() method is invoked, which then imports and executes main().",
  "anomalies": "The run() method executes code from main.py immediately after installation without any validation or checks. No apparent input handling, but automatic execution of code post-install is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation class that, upon installation, imports and executes a function 'main' from main.py. This behavior could be malicious if main.py contains harmful code, as it runs automatically during package installation. The package metadata appears standard, but the immediate execution of main() during install is suspicious because it could trigger malicious activity without user awareness. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets or obfuscated elements but does perform an unconditioned execution of potentially arbitrary code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious behavior: executing main() from main.py immediately during package installation. This could be used to run malicious code without user consent. The rest of the setup appears standard, but the automatic invocation of main() raises security concerns.",
