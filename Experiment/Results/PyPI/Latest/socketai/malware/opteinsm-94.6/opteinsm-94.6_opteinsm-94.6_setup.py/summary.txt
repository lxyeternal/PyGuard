  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing main() during installation poses a significant security risk, especially if main.py contains malicious code. The scores should be adjusted to indicate a high likelihood of malicious behavior (malware score ~0.6, security risk ~0.6), emphasizing the need for further inspection of main.py and caution in using this package."
