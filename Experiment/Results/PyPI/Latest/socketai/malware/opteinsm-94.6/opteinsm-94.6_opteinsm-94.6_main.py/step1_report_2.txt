  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (subprocess calls), base64 encoding of MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) are gathered, encoded, and then appended as URL parameters in HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain names, base64 encoding MAC addresses, and the absence of any response processing or error handling beyond silent exception catching. The URLs and data collection suggest potential data exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials, but the pattern indicates possible tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "analysis": "The code collects host-specific data such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses via system commands. MAC addresses are encoded with base64, possibly to obfuscate the data. The data is then sent via HTTP GET requests to three external URLs, which appear suspicious due to their domain names and patterns. The code does not process responses or errors meaningfully, indicating potential covert operation. The URLs' domains and the pattern of data collection suggest a possible malicious intent to exfiltrate system information. The use of subprocess to execute system commands and encode their output is a typical pattern for gathering hardware info. The data transmission pattern resembles known data exfiltration techniques, although no payload or payload-related malicious activity (e.g., code injection, malware installation) is directly observed. Overall, this code appears to be designed for covertly collecting and transmitting system info to external servers, which could be used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The script covertly gathers system information, encodes it, and exfiltrates it to suspicious external domains. The behavior aligns with data collection or potential reconnaissance activities, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent with possible privacy violations or security risks.",
