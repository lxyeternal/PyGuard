{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local module named 'info'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'info' module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imported symbols from 'info' may be used elsewhere; this code alone does not demonstrate data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') can be risky, as it obscures which symbols are imported and may hide malicious code or unintended behavior, but it does not itself indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement importing all symbols from the 'info' module within the same package. This is a common Python practice but can be risky if the imported module contains malicious code or if the package structure is compromised. There are no other code elements, no data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns visible in this snippet. The import alone does not provide enough evidence of malicious behavior but warrants checking the 'info' module for potential issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple relative import statement. While it does not directly demonstrate malicious behavior, the use of wildcard imports can hide unintended or malicious code within the 'info' module. Further review of the 'info' module is recommended to ensure security.",
