{
  "purpose": "Imports all contents from the 'info' module located in the same package, likely to utilize its variables, functions, or classes.",
  "sources": "The 'from .info import *' statement, which loads code and data from the local 'info' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks observed in this single line; potential sinks depend on how the imported contents are used later.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the local 'info' module into the current namespace via import, with subsequent usage depending on the broader code context.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to potential namespace pollution and obscured code behavior. No malicious behavior evident in this line alone, but this pattern can hide malicious or unintended imports.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a relative import of all components from a module named 'info'. Since only this single line is provided, there are no observable malicious behaviors such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors. The use of 'import *' could potentially hide malicious imports or obscure the source of imported functions or variables, which could be exploited for malicious purposes if the 'info' module contains harmful code. Without inspecting the contents of 'info', no definitive malicious activity can be concluded. The minimal code structure indicates standard import behavior with a noted concern about 'import *'.",
  "conclusion": "The code imports everything from a local 'info' module. No direct malicious activity or security issues are evident solely from this line, but the use of 'import *' warrants caution, especially if the 'info' module is untrusted or malicious. Additional context on the 'info' module is needed for a comprehensive assessment.",
