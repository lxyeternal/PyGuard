  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'info' in the current package",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package directory",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; import statement itself does not execute untrusted code or handle data directly",
  "flows": "N/A, only an import statement with no runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*'), which can lead to namespace pollution and obscured code behavior, but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code performs a single import statement using a relative import syntax to import everything from the 'info' module within the same package. There is no indication of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The use of wildcard import is generally discouraged for clarity and maintainability but does not imply malicious intent. No suspicious behaviors, external network activity, or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. The use of wildcard import is a style concern but not a security issue.",
