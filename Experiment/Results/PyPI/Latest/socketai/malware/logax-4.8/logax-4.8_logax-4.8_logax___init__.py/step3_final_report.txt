  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local 'info' module using relative import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no other data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; only module import occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*'), which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if 'info' is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal relative import statement. No malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage is evident. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the 'info' module, which is not provided. The wildcard import can hide malicious symbols or code, but the snippet itself does not contain such behavior. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk is low but slightly elevated due to reliance on external module trustworthiness. Confidence is high that the code itself is benign; the main risk depends on the content of 'info'.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign and primarily raises concerns about the trustworthiness of the 'info' module. No active malicious activity is detected, and the use of 'import *' is a style concern rather than a security issue. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk is approximately 0.2, reflecting cautiousness about external module trust.",
