  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports are about the same code: `from .info import *`\n- The code is minimal, with no other logic or data flow.\n- The primary concern is the use of wildcard import (`*`), which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if the 'info' module is malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import all from 'info'.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior evident; only an import.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The minimal code is not malicious. The low risk score and high confidence are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning, emphasizing the risk of obscured malicious code in 'info'.\n- **Conclusion:** Similar, recommends further review of 'info'.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.4.\n\n**Assessment:** The securityRisk is slightly higher here, which is reasonable given the potential for malicious content in 'info'. Confidence is lower, which is appropriate given the minimal code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Again, the import is not inherently malicious; use of wildcard import is a style concern but not a security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** No apparent malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The risk score is appropriate, and confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Highlights that the import could have security implications if 'info' is malicious, especially since code execution can occur during import.\n- **Conclusion:** Potential security concern if 'info' is malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3, confidence=0.6.\n\n**Assessment:** This is a cautious stance, which is justified. The securityRisk score is slightly higher, considering the possibility that the imported module could contain malicious code that executes upon import. Confidence is moderate, reflecting uncertainty about the 'info' module's trustworthiness.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to others, emphasizing that 'import *' can hide malicious imports, but no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Additional context needed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.5.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The cautious approach is appropriate, given the potential risks.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code in the snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All zero, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk scores:** Range from 0.1 to 0.3, reflecting the potential risk due to the use of 'import *' and reliance on the 'info' module's trustworthiness.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the 'info' module, which cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.\n- No changes needed in the scores; they align with the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (moderate, due to potential hidden malicious code in 'info')\n\nThis conservative estimate reflects the current information: minimal code, potential for hidden issues in the imported module, but no direct evidence of malicious activity.",
