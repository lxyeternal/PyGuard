  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign and primarily raises concerns about the trustworthiness of the 'info' module. No active malicious activity is detected, and the use of 'import *' is a style concern rather than a security issue. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk is approximately 0.2, reflecting cautiousness about external module trust."
