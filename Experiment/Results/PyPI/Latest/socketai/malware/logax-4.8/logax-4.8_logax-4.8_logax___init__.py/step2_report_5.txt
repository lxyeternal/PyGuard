  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the consistency of the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe a simple import statement: `from .info import *` or similar.\n- No actual code execution, data flow, or network activity is shown.\n- The main concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious code if the 'info' module is compromised.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or explicit malware behaviors are evident in these snippets.\n- The 'malware' score is consistently 0, reflecting no direct evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as an import statement. No issues here.\n- **Malware presence:** Since the code is only an import, and there's no evidence of malicious behavior, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code is shown; scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Security risk:** While the use of `import *` can be risky from a maintainability perspective, it does not inherently pose a security risk unless the imported module is malicious. The scores ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 reflect this cautious stance, which seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Specific issues with the scores:\n\n- **Report 1:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — minimal, acceptable.  \n  - Confidence: 0.9 — justified given the minimal code.\n\n- **Report 2:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 — acceptable, considering the wildcard import.  \n  - Confidence: 0.4 — slightly lower, but acceptable.\n\n- **Report 3:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — justified.  \n  - Confidence: 0.8 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Report 4:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.3 — slightly higher, reflecting the concern about the 'info' module potentially being malicious.  \n  - Confidence: 0.6 — reasonable.\n\n- **Report 5:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 — acceptable.  \n  - Confidence: 0.5 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The scores align with the minimal code snippet and the known risks associated with wildcard imports, especially if the imported module is malicious or compromised.\n\n- **Should any scores be adjusted?**  \n  Given the information, no. The assessments appropriately reflect the low likelihood of malicious activity based solely on this import statement.\n\n- **Are there any overlooked issues?**  \n  - The primary concern remains the trustworthiness of the 'info' module. If the module is untrusted or from an unverified source, the risk increases.  \n  - The reports correctly identify that further inspection of 'info' is necessary for a definitive security assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0, as no evidence of malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Keep low (around 0.1–0.3), acknowledging the potential for issues if the imported module is malicious, but recognizing that the code snippet itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n**Overall, all reports are accurate in their assessment.** The main concern is the trustworthiness of the 'info' module, not the import statement itself. The scores are consistent with the minimal code and known best practices.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — considering the use of wildcard import and potential trust issues with the 'info' module.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current reports and scores are appropriate. No further adjustments are necessary based on the provided code snippets.",
