{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'info'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which reads the 'info' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data processing in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement uses a wildcard import, which can obscure the imported content, but by itself, this is not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple import statement that pulls all definitions from the 'info' module in the same package. Since it's only an import and contains no further logic, there are no active security risks or malicious behaviors visible here. However, wildcard imports can sometimes hide malicious code or unintended behaviors if the imported module is malicious, but that cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks based solely on this code. No malware or obfuscation is evident. The security risk score is low, and confidence is high that there is no malicious behavior in this snippet.",
