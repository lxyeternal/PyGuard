  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .info import *`\n- The code is a relative import of all symbols from a local module `info`.\n- No other code, data, or behavior is shown.\n- Use of `import *` is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution and obscurity, but it is not inherently malicious.\n- The main concern is the trustworthiness of the `info` module and whether it contains malicious code or hidden behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Presence:\n\n- The code snippet is present in all reports.\n- No other code or behaviors are observed, so no active malicious code or data flows are confirmed.\n- The import statement itself does not execute code beyond importing symbols, unless the `info` module contains top-level code that executes upon import.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n\n- All reports correctly note that `import *` can hide malicious or unintended behavior if the imported module is malicious.\n- They also acknowledge that, in isolation, the code does not demonstrate malicious activity.\n- No report claims that the import statement itself is malicious, only that it warrants further inspection of the `info` module.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n\n**Malware Score:**\n\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the minimal code and lack of evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The only potential for malicious activity lies in the contents of `info`, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is reasonable because the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n**Security Risk Score:**\n\n- The scores range from 0.1 to 0.3.\n- Given the potential for malicious code within `info`, and the use of `import *`, a slightly higher score could be justified, especially if the `info` module is untrusted.\n- However, since no actual malicious behavior is observed, the scores seem conservative.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.3.\n- Given the minimal code, this seems appropriate unless the `info` module is known to be malicious or compromised.\n- The primary concern is trust in the `info` module, not the import statement itself.\n\n### Consistency and Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The reports correctly identify the main concern: the trustworthiness of the `info` module.\n- No report claims any active malicious behavior from this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No evidence of malicious activity in this snippet.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.2 — Slightly higher due to reliance on an external module, but still low given the information.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The real security concern hinges on the contents of the `info` module, which is not provided.\n- If the `info` module is untrusted or could be malicious, the risk increases significantly.\n- The use of `import *` should be flagged as a style and maintainability concern, but not a direct security risk unless malicious code is hidden within the imported module.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score | Justification                                                  |\n|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                       | No evidence of malicious code in the snippet itself.          |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                       | Code is clear; no obfuscation present.                         |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2                     | Slightly elevated due to reliance on external module; depends on trustworthiness of `info`. |\n\n**In conclusion,** the current scores are reasonable given the minimal code. The primary focus should be on verifying the integrity and contents of the `info` module to assess the actual security risk.",
