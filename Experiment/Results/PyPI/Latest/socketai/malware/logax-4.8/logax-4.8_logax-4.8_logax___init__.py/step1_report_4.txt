  "purpose": "Import all definitions and functions from the info module in the current package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing everything from .info module",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data outputs; potential for indirect effects if info module contains malicious code",
  "flows": "Importing potentially executes code from info module; no direct data flow shown in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .info import *' can hide imported code, making analysis harder; potential for malicious code if info module is malicious",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement that imports all contents from a local info module. This pattern can obscure malicious imports if the info module contains malicious code. Since the code is minimal, there are no other behaviors, but the reliance on an external module without scrutiny raises security concerns. The act of importing could trigger code execution if the info module has top-level code. No other suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with potential security implications if the imported info module is malicious or compromised. Due to the minimal nature of the code, the primary concern is the trustworthiness of the info module itself.",
