  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code is a simple relative import statement importing all symbols from a local module named `info`.\n- There are no visible malicious behaviors, code execution, or data handling in this snippet alone.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe import statement itself is benign. The primary concern with such code arises from the contents of the `info` module, which is not provided here.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the import as benign and notes the risk of wildcard import hiding malicious code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (high confidence in low risk)\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malware)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Also correctly notes the use of wildcard import and recommends further review of `info`.\n- **Confidence:** 0.4 (moderate confidence)\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous, emphasizes style concern over security.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 (high confidence)\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Highlights potential security implications if `info` contains malicious code, which is valid.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (since the code alone doesn't indicate malware)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.3 (moderate risk due to reliance on external module)\n- **Justification:** The concern about the trustworthiness of `info` is valid, but without evidence of malicious code, the malware score remains zero.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to others, notes the risk of obscured imports.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Not assigned any high obfuscation concern; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variations but generally low, reflecting the minimal code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of the `info` module, which cannot be assessed here.\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or behavior in the provided code snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code snippet itself is benign.\n- The potential for malicious activity hinges entirely on the contents of the `info` module, which is not provided.\n- Therefore, the malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score remains **0**.\n- The overall security risk is low, but caution is warranted when importing modules with wildcard imports, especially if their source is untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type        | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                   | No malicious code evident in the import statement itself.   |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                   | Code is straightforward; no obfuscation observed.           |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1 - 0.2           | Minimal risk; depends on `info` module's trustworthiness.  |\n\n**Final note:**  \nFurther review of the `info` module's contents is essential for a comprehensive security assessment.",
