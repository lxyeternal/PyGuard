  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports concern the same minimal code: `from .info import *`\n- The core concern revolves around the use of wildcard imports (`*`), which can obscure the imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if the 'info' module is compromised.\n- No evidence of active malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present in these snippets.\n- The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of the 'info' module, not the import statement itself.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues in code:\n- The code snippets are consistent: they all show a relative import with `*`.\n- There are no other code elements to analyze.\n- No active vulnerabilities or malicious code are visible in these snippets.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- All reports correctly identify the use of `import *` as a potential risk, though they correctly note that this alone isn't malicious.\n- They emphasize the importance of inspecting the 'info' module for malicious content, which is appropriate.\n- The reports do not mention the possibility of code execution during import if 'info' contains top-level code, which could be a concern if the module is untrusted.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the minimal code and no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.3, reflecting a low but non-zero concern mainly due to the use of `import *` and potential trust issues with the 'info' module.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.3, which seems appropriate.\n- The primary risk is the potential maliciousness of the 'info' module, which cannot be assessed here.\n- The use of wildcard import increases the difficulty of code analysis but does not inherently pose a high risk unless the imported module is malicious.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- Scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n- The confidence levels are appropriately set, with higher confidence where the code is straightforward.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports could emphasize that the real security concern hinges on the content of the 'info' module, which is external and unverified.\n- If the 'info' module is malicious, the import could execute malicious code at import time, which warrants a higher security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Risk score:** Given the potential for malicious content in 'info', a cautious estimate would be around **0.2 to 0.3** if the module is untrusted. Since the current reports align with this, I agree with their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a simple relative import with a wildcard.\n- No malicious activity is evident from the snippets.\n- The main concern is the trustworthiness of the 'info' module, not the import statement itself.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Set a security risk score around 0.2–0.3, reflecting the potential risk if the 'info' module is malicious or compromised.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always review the contents of the imported module to fully assess security implications.",
