  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package called 'logax', used for package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, listing dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or could lead to data leaks or code execution are present.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content for long_description; dependencies are specified for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior observed. The setup script follows standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, reads a markdown file for description, and configures package metadata and dependencies. There are no hardcoded secrets, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The dependencies include requests, pybase64, and importlib, which are common and benign. No code injection or malicious logic is present. The structure and content are consistent with typical setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is benign, standard, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
