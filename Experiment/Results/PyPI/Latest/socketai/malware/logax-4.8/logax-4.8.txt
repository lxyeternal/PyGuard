      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign and primarily raises concerns about the trustworthiness of the 'info' module. No active malicious activity is detected, and the use of 'import *' is a style concern rather than a security issue. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk is approximately 0.2, reflecting cautiousness about external module trust."

      "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits high-risk, malicious-like behaviors, including remote code download and execution, obfuscation, and stealth markers. The scores assigned in the reports are justified. It should be flagged as malicious or highly suspicious, and further analysis of remote content is recommended."
