  "analysis": "The code is completely empty, indicating no executable statements, variables, or logic. This absence confirms that there are no security risks, malware, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The confidence in this assessment is high due to the lack of content. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detectable. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, aligning with the evidence.",
