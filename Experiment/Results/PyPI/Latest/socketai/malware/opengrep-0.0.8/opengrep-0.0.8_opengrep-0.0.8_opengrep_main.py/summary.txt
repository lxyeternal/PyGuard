  "conclusion": "The script is primarily a privacy-invasive data collection tool with insecure practices. It does not contain explicit malicious payloads or backdoors but poses significant security and privacy risks due to covert data exfiltration, SSL bypass, and silent failure handling. The malware score should be moderate, and the security risk score high, reflecting the potential for misuse."
