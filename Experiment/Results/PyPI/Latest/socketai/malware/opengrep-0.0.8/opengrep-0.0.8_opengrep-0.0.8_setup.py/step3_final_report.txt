  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the 'opengrep' Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package info, dependencies, and entry points; no external input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed or external outputs generated.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static configuration, no dynamic code execution, external input handling, or suspicious constructs. All signals indicate benign intent. Dependencies are standard, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
