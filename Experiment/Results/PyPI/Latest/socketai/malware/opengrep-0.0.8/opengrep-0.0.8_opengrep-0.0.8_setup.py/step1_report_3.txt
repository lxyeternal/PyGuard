  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'opengrep' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, and setup configurations; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "Writes package metadata and dependencies to setup configuration; no data sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Package information flows from variables and function calls within setup() to the packaging system; no untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Use of standard setuptools without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, defines versioning, and calls setup() with project metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No user input handling, no network operations, or code execution based on external data are present. The dependencies are minimal and explicitly listed. The structure is typical for a Python package setup, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscated code. The package appears safe based on this script alone.",
