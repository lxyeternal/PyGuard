  "purpose": "The code executes a system command that sends data to an external server.",
  "sources": "The call to os.system with the string containing the curl command.",
  "sinks": "The external server URL receiving POST data via curl executed through os.system.",
  "flows": "Input data ('cool boss this is shubh!') is sent via a POST request to the specified URL when execute_payload() is called.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system to execute an external command is potentially dangerous; the hardcoded URL and data indicate possible exfiltration or tracking behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function execute_payload() that runs a shell command using os.system. The command uses curl to send a POST request with a fixed message to an external URL. The function is immediately invoked. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or a beacon, potentially malicious depending on context. No input handling or validation is performed, and the URL is hardcoded, suggesting intentional external communication. The code structure is simple and straightforward, but the intent appears suspicious as it leaks data externally without user consent or apparent purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an external POST request with hardcoded data, indicating potential malicious behavior such as data exfiltration. It lacks context but shows signs of malicious intent based on external communication and lack of transparency.",
