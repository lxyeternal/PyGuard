{
  "purpose": "The code executes a system command that sends data via an HTTP POST request to an external URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it internally executes a hardcoded command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executes a shell command that makes an HTTP request to an external server.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded string in os.system() -> system shell execution -> external network request to specified URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with a hardcoded command that sends data to an external server is suspicious. The URL appears to be a transient or suspicious domain, possibly for exfiltration or command-and-control activities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that, when called, executes a system command using os.system(). The command performs a curl POST request sending a string ('cool boss this is shubh!') to a specific URL. No external input influences the command, indicating deterministic behavior. The action of sending data to an external, potentially suspicious domain without user consent suggests malicious or covert exfiltration activity. The code is minimal but aligns with common patterns of data leakage or command-and-control communication in malicious scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a covert data transmission to an external domain, indicating malicious intent. The use of os.system() for network activity with hardcoded data is suspicious, and the domain may be malicious or used for command-and-control purposes.",
