  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup parameters for packaging a Python project called 'sysconx4'.",
  "sources": "User input via setup() parameters, specifically static string literals for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources; no data sinks or external communication present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A - all data is static and hardcoded within the setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard setuptools functions with benign parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward use of setuptools to define package metadata. It does not include any code execution, input handling, or network operations. The 'name', 'version', 'description', 'author', and 'packages' fields are all static and typical for Python package setup scripts. There is no indication of malicious behavior or suspicious patterns, and no obfuscated or dynamic code present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
