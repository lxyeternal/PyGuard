  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static configuration without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard setup script with no suspicious patterns or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script using setuptools, containing only static data. No dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The description 'for pentesting' does not imply malicious intent; it is merely a label. All reports correctly identify the code as benign with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The malware score is appropriately zero, obfuscation absent, and security risk minimal. The slight elevation in risk score (0.1) in some reports is due to the description, but the code itself remains safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The mention of 'pentesting' in the description does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the package poses no security threat based on this code snippet.",
