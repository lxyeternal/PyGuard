  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup parameters for a Python package named 'sysconx4', intended for pentesting.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters, find_packages() function call",
  "sinks": "None evident; no dynamic or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink involving untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "The package description 'package for pentesting' may indicate potentially sensitive or offensive tooling; no code-based anomalies or backdoors are present",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, including name, version, description, author, and packages to include. There are no dynamic operations, no code execution, and no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. The description suggests it is intended for pentesting, but this is not inherently malicious. No obfuscated or unusual code patterns are present. The find_packages() function call is standard for package discovery.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign setup configuration for a package related to pentesting tools. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this code.",
