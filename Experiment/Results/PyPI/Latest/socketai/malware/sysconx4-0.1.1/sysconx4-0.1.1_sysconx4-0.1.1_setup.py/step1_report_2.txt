{
  "purpose": "Setuptools setup script for a Python package named 'sysconx4' intended for pentesting.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version, description, author).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data is used or processed.",
  "flows": "The script flows from importing setup functions to defining package metadata, culminating in the setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "The package is described as 'for pentesting,' which may imply potentially malicious usage, but the script itself contains no malicious code or unusual behavior. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project, with no code executing at runtime besides package configuration. No input or data processing occurs, and no external connections or system modifications are performed. The description indicating 'for pentesting' does not imply malicious code, only the intended use case. The script itself is benign and typical of Python packaging procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. The description may suggest the package is used for security testing, but the script itself is safe.",
