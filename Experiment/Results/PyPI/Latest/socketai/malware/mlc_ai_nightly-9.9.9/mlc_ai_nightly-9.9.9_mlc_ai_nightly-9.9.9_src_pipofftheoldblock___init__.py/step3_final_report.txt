  "purpose": "No code provided; assessment based on summaries indicating benign or no suspicious activity.",
  "sources": "N/A due to absence of code; no data input or external sources identified.",
  "sinks": "N/A; no untrusted data flows or potential data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "N/A; no source-to-sink data flows present without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; absence of code prevents identification of suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack concrete code snippets, relying on high-level descriptions. The evaluations correctly note the absence of malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with no evidence of malicious activity. Risk scores are low (around 0.2), reflecting cautious suspicion but limited evidence. Confidence levels vary based on the amount of information; higher where detailed analysis is provided, lower where no code exists. The reasoning is sound, and scores are appropriate given the limited data.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are reasonable and consistent with the available information. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The low risk scores are justified, though they could be slightly lowered to reflect the absence of concrete code. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears benign, with no indications of malicious or obfuscated code.",
