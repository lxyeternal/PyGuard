  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high-risk behavior characteristic of supply chain attacks or backdoors, executing arbitrary code during installation. The suspicious module name and invocation pattern justify high malware (~0.75) and security risk (~0.75) scores. Further investigation of 'pipofftheoldblock.run' is recommended before trusting or deploying this package."
