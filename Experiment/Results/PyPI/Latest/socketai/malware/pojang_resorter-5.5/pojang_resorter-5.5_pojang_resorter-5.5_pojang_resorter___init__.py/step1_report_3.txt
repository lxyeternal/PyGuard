  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static metadata and import are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports a main function from a local module. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling, and no network or system operations. The import is standard for Python packages. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a standard Python package setup, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
