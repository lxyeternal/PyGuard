  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code Overview:**\nThe code is a minimal Python module, likely an `__init__.py` or entry point, containing only:\n- Package metadata (`__version__`, `__author__`)\n- An import statement: `from .main import main`\n\n**Assessment of the Code:**\n- No input handling, data processing, or network operations.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- The import is static and from a local module, which is standard for Python packages.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns, and no malware behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, static, and benign.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly noting the absence of malicious or suspicious activity.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The scores assigned (`malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`) are appropriate given the code.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is justified.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Risk Justification:\n- Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, the risk scores are correctly low.\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they simply describe the code's nature.\n\n### Potential Claims Based on Assumptions:\n- No claims in the reports are based on unwarranted assumptions; all observations are factual and supported by the code.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard package initialization file with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. It is typical boilerplate code for a Python package, and the reports reflect this accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code and reports are aligned, and the security assessment is correct. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nIf future code includes dynamic behaviors, network operations, or suspicious patterns, scores should be revisited accordingly.",
