{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main, module-level variables __version__ and __author__",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; import is static, variables are assigned literals",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded version and author info are standard practice, no dynamic code execution or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains module-level metadata and a single import statement. The import is relative and static, pointing to another module within the package. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected, nor any obfuscation or backdoors. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for a Python package's __init__.py or main module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a package initializer with metadata. No signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks identified.",
