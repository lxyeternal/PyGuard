{
  "purpose": "Minimal package module defining metadata and importing main function",
  "sources": "Package metadata (__version__, __author__), static import from local module (.main)",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static import and metadata only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard boilerplate",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module, likely an __init__.py, containing only package metadata and a static import. It lacks any input handling, network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All indicators point to benign, standard package setup code. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present. The import is local and static, with no secrets or sensitive data embedded. The minimal structure and absence of dynamic features confirm the benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package module with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
