  "anomalies": "No anomalies; very minimal code, no hardcoded credentials, no malicious code or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports a main function from a local module. There are no data input sources, no untrusted data handling, no external network connections, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical package initialization file with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple package setup file with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It only sets metadata and imports a function, which is standard practice.",
