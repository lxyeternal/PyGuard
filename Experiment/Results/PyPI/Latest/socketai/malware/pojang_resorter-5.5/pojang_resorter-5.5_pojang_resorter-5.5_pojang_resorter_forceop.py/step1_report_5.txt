{
  "purpose": "The script assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server via RCON.",
  "sources": "User inputs for username, server IP, RCON port, and RCON password.",
  "sinks": "The command execution through the MCRcon library which sends commands to the server.",
  "flows": "User inputs → assign_operator() function → mcr.command('op {username}') → Server executes command.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The RCON password is supplied as an argument, which could be sensitive if improperly handled, but not inherently malicious. No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code collects user-provided data to connect to a Minecraft server via RCON and executes the 'op' command. The connection is managed securely within a context manager. There is proper error handling and logging. No malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, system modification beyond assigning privileges, or malicious network activity, are present. The code performs a straightforward administrative task with standard libraries and practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for managing Minecraft server operator privileges with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It handles inputs appropriately and performs its function transparently.",
