  "purpose": "Assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server via RCON.",
  "sources": "User input parameters: username, server IP, RCON port, RCON password",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'op {username}' command on the server; logging actions which include sensitive info",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the assign_operator function, which uses them to connect and execute the command; logs record server IP and password",
  "anomalies": "Logging server IP and RCON password could expose sensitive data if logs are accessed by unauthorized parties",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard libraries and practices to connect to a Minecraft server and assign operator privileges. It handles errors appropriately. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The primary concern is logging sensitive credentials, which could be a security risk if logs are exposed. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The security risk score is low (~0.15-0.2), mainly due to potential misuse and sensitive info in logs, but not due to inherent vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, purpose-specific utility for managing Minecraft server operator privileges. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the logging of sensitive credentials, which should be handled carefully. Overall, the code is safe with minimal security risks.",
