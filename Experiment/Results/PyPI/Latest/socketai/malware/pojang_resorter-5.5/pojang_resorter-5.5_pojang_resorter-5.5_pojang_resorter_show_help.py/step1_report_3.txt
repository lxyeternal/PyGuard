{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for a Python-Mojang interaction tool, displaying help information with ASCII art and command options.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse; reads color configuration via colorama initialization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data into system commands or external systems; output is only printed to console.",
  "flows": "User input via command-line arguments determines displayed help; no flow to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code structure is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes color output, defines a function to display stylized help with ASCII art, and uses argparse to define subcommands. No untrusted data processing, external network connections, or suspicious behaviors are present. The function only displays static content and parses command-line arguments, which is typical for CLI help scripts. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI help utility that displays stylized ASCII art and command descriptions. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
