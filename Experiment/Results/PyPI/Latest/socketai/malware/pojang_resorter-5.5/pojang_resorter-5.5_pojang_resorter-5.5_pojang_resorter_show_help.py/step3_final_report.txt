  "purpose": "Display ASCII art and command help messages for a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "argparse for command parsing, colorama for colored output, static ASCII art string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external system interactions or data leaks.",
  "flows": "User input via command line -> argparse parsing -> display ASCII art and help messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, straightforward code with no dynamic or malicious components.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static CLI help utility that displays ASCII art and command descriptions using argparse and colorama. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The code is purely cosmetic and for user interface purposes. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code structure is simple, readable, and free of obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static CLI help utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored. No modifications are necessary.",
