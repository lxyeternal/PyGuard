  "flows": "User inputs command line arguments; parsed and displayed with ASCII art and help messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; use of colorama is benign; no dynamic code execution or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a help display with ASCII art and colored output. It uses argparse to set up commands and displays help information. There is no data processing, network activity, or interaction with external systems that could be malicious. No unusual code, obfuscation, or potential injection points are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI help display tool with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve solely for user assistance with command options and aesthetics.",
