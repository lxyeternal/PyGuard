{
  "purpose": "To provide a command-line interface (CLI) tool that displays ASCII art, colorized headers, and command help messages for managing a hypothetical Python-Mojang interaction application.",
  "sources": "Input is received via command-line arguments processed by argparse.",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout (console display). No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input from argparse arguments influences which help message and ASCII art are displayed; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard use of argparse and colorama. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a function to display help info with ASCII art and colored headers, and sets up argparse subcommands for different functionalities. The ASCII art and command descriptions are static strings with no dynamic or external data manipulation. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security issues. The code is primarily UI/UX enhancement for CLI interaction without any dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign CLI help display utility with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It functions solely to present help messages with stylized ASCII art and colored text, using standard libraries and practices.",
