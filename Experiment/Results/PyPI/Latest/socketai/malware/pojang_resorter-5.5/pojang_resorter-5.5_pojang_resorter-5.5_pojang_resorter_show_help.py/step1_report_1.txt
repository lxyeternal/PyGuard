{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface with ASCII art and colored help messages for a Python tool related to Mojang interactions.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine which command is invoked.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data beyond argument parsing, and does not perform any network, file, or data leakage operations.",
  "flows": "Input (command-line arguments) from argparse control the flow but do not lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The ASCII art and color formatting are benign and purely cosmetic.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for terminal coloring, defines a function to display help with ASCII art and colored headers, and sets up command-line subcommands. It only prints static ASCII art and help information. No external data, network activity, or sensitive operations are performed. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI help utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely displays static ASCII art and command descriptions without handling sensitive data or executing unsafe operations.",
