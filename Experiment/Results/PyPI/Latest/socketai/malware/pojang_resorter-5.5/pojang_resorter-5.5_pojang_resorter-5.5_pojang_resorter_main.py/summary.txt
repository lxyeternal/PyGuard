  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward, controlled command dispatcher with no malicious code detected. Its main risks stem from external dependencies and the potential destructive 'nukeserver' command. Proper validation of external modules, safeguards around destructive commands, and limited external script execution mitigate these risks. Overall, the code is low risk with controlled behavior."
