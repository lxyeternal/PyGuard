  "purpose": "Obfuscated Python code that decompresses and executes hidden functionality, likely to conceal malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Input data: Base64-encoded, reversed string used in __import__ and decompress functions.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decompressed code via exec(), which may run malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Input data (reversed base64 string) → base64 decoding → zlib decompression → exec() executes the resulting code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of reverse slicing (__[::-1]), base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and exec() indicates obfuscation. No explicit secrets or hardcoded credentials present, but the pattern is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that reverses the input string, decodes it from base64, and decompresses it using zlib. The exec() function then executes the decompressed code. This pattern is commonly used for obfuscation and hiding malicious payloads. The string appears to be a large, complex base64-encoded, reversed blob, which, when decompressed, could contain any Python code. The absence of clear logic or safe functions suggests the code's primary purpose is to conceal its real intent. Given the obfuscation and the execution of dynamically decompressed code, there is a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious due to its obfuscated nature, dynamic code execution, and complex decoding steps. It is likely designed to conceal malicious payloads or backdoors. It should be treated as potentially malicious, and further analysis of the decompressed payload is recommended.",
