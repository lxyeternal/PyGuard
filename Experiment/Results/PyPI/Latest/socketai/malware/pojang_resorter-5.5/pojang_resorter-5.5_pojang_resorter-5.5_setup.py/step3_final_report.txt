{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration defining dependencies, entry points, and including a Windows executable as package data.",
  "sources": "Dependencies listed in 'install_requires'; inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe' as package data.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution or use of 'libs/windows.exe' during installation or runtime, which could lead to malicious activity if the executable is harmful.",
  "flows": "The setup script installs dependencies and includes the executable; no runtime data flow or untrusted input handling occurs within this script.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of an executable ('libs/windows.exe') as package data without context; no code obfuscation or malicious code present in the script itself.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py is a typical configuration script with no active malicious code or obfuscation. The primary concern is the inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe', which could be benign or malicious depending on its contents. The dependencies are common and not inherently suspicious. The scores assigned in reports are low for malware (~0.2-0.25) and risk (~0.2-0.3), aligning with the absence of direct malicious activity. Further inspection of the executable is recommended but outside the scope of this script. Overall, the setup is benign, with the executable inclusion being the only point requiring additional verification.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration. The inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe' is suspicious but not malicious based solely on this script. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate; further analysis of the executable is advised before deployment.",
