  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for the 'pojang_resorter' Python package, including dependencies, entry points, and package data.",

  "sinks": "N/A (configuration code; no untrusted data handling or output).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow, as this is setup/configuration code).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'libs/windows.exe' as package data, which is an executable file; potentially suspicious if included without context, especially if malicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and includes a Windows executable file as package data. All dependencies are common Python packages. The inclusion of an executable file ('libs/windows.exe') warrants further scrutiny since executables in package data could be used to deliver malicious payloads or backdoors. However, based solely on this script, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors. The rest of the setup configuration appears standard and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script appears typical for a Python package, but the inclusion of an executable file in package data could be suspicious depending on its source and purpose. No active malicious behavior detected in this code snippet. Further review of 'libs/windows.exe' is recommended to confirm its safety.",
