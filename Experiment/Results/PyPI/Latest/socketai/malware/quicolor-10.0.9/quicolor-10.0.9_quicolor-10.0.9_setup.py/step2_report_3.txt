  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code presence and functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools`. It contains static package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There is no dynamic code, user input handling, or obfuscation.  \n   **Conclusion**: The code matches the description and is typical for Python package configuration.\n\n2. **Malicious behavior and anomalies**:  \n   None of the reports detect any malicious activity, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward, with no code execution, network calls (beyond dependencies), or hidden payloads.  \n   **Conclusion**: No malware or malicious intent is present.\n\n3. **Scores review**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0  \n   - `obfuscated`: 0  \n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   - `confidence`: 1  \n\n   These are consistent with the analysis. Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions**:  \n   The reports emphasize that the code is static, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. There are no claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities, only observations based on code analysis.\n\n5. **Overall assessment**:  \n   The code is a typical setup script with no security risks. The highest risk score should remain low (e.g., 0.0 or 0.1) since there's no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. Malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated is 0, and security risk is 0.\n\n**Final recommendation**:  \n- The current scores are appropriate and justified.  \n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0.0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering minimal risk, but 0 is more accurate here)\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a benign, standard package setup script with no security issues. The reports are consistent, and the scores reflect the actual risk level accurately.",
