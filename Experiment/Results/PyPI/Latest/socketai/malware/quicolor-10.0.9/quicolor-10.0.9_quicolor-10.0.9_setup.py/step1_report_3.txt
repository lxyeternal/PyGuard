{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata and configuration for the 'quicolor' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters such as name, version, packages, install_requires, author info, description, keywords, url, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration data only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors observed. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration settings. All values are static, hardcoded strings, and no dynamic or user input handling is present. The dependencies are limited to the 'requests' library, which is a common package. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The structure is typical for Python package setup files and does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
