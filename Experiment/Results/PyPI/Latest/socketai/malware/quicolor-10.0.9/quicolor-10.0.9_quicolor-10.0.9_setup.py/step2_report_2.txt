  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard `setup.py` script for package configuration.\n- No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code simply declares package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n- The dependency 'requests' is common and not suspicious.\n- No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.\n\n**Confirmation of code correctness:**\n- The code matches the description: it's a typical `setup.py`.\n- No anomalies, such as obfuscation or code that executes untrusted data, are present.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or code injections.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- None detected. The code appears correct and standard.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- Risk scores are all 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Justification for scores:**\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present, scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n- The code is static, with no dynamic or malicious constructs.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are warranted here; the code is plain and standard.\n- The dependency 'requests' is common and not malicious.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign, with no security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, legitimate `setup.py` script for package configuration. All evidence points to it being safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
