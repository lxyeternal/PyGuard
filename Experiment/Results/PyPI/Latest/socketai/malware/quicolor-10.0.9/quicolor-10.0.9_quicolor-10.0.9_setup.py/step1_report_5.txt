  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive operations; dependencies are specified for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code is standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setuptools setup configuration. It specifies package details, dependencies, and metadata without executing any untrusted code or malicious operations. The only external interaction is the declaration of a dependency ('requests') and package metadata. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
