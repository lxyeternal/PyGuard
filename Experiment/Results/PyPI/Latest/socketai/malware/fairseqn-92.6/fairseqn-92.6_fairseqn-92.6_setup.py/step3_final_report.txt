{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines a custom installation class that, after performing the standard install, imports and executes main() from a module named main, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data primarily from the import statement 'from main import main' and the execution of main() in the run() method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() during setup acts as a sink where untrusted or malicious code could be executed, leading to potential system compromise.",
  "flows": "Source: import main; sink: call to main() during run() in the custom install class.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes external code (main()) during installation, which is atypical and suspicious; no obfuscation or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, after standard installation, imports and runs main() from main.py. This pattern is unusual because setup scripts typically do not execute arbitrary code during install. The behavior could be exploited for malicious purposes if main() contains harmful code. The pattern is straightforward and lacks obfuscation. The risk depends on the content of main.py, but executing external code during setup is inherently dangerous. The scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.75, risk ~0.75) are justified given this pattern. No evidence of obfuscation or hardcoded secrets is present. Overall, this pattern is a common tactic in supply chain attacks and warrants high caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing main() during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate, reflecting the high potential for malicious code execution. Without inspecting main.py, certainty is limited, but the pattern itself warrants treating this package with suspicion.",
