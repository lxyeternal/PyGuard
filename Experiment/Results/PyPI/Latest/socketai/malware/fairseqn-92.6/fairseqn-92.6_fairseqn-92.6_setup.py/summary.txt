  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing main() during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate, reflecting the high potential for malicious code execution. Without inspecting main.py, certainty is limited, but the pattern itself warrants treating this package with suspicion."
