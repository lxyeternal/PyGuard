  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "Reading system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), executing system commands ('getmac', 'ifconfig'), generating random number, encoding MAC addresses in base64.",
  "sinks": "Sending HTTP GET requests with collected data to external URLs via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "System info -> encoding -> URL construction -> HTTP request to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious external URLs (likely C2 or tracking domains), base64 encoding of MAC addresses, multiple network requests to potentially malicious domains, no validation or filtering of URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system info including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current working directory. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 before sending. The URLs contacted are unusual, suspicious domains that could be used for command and control, data exfiltration, or tracking. The requests are made without any validation or user consent, and errors are silently ignored. No malicious system modification or backdoors are evident, but the pattern of data collection and transmission to suspicious domains indicates potential malicious intent or at least malicious tracking behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for tracking or data exfiltration purposes, contacting suspicious external servers with encoded system info. There is a significant security concern due to the hidden data transmission to potentially malicious domains without user consent. No direct malware behavior like damaging files or executing malicious payloads is observed, but the behavior is suspicious and should be considered risky.",
