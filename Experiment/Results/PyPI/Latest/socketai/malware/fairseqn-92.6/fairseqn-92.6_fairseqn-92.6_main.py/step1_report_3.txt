  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple external URLs encoded in Base64.",
  "sources": "Reading system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), MAC addresses via subprocess calls, environment variables indirectly through system commands.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending HTTP GET requests with URL parameters containing system info and encoded MAC addresses.",
  "flows": "System info and MAC addresses are gathered, encoded, then sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to gather MAC addresses could be suspicious; encoding MAC addresses in Base64 may be to obfuscate data transmission. URLs appear suspicious and are likely malicious or part of a C2 setup. No user input validation or sanitization observed.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in Base64 to possibly evade detection or simple filtering. The data is then sent via HTTP GET requests to three external URLs, which are suspicious, potentially malicious domains (notably oast.cn and oast.fun, commonly used in red team activities or malicious setups). The URL structure suggests data exfiltration. The use of subprocess for MAC address retrieval on different platforms indicates cross-platform data collection. No explicit malicious payload or backdoor present, but the behavior resembles data exfiltration or surveillance activity. No code obfuscation or malicious payload manipulation is detected; the behavior appears to be privacy-invasive and potentially malicious depending on user intent and context.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects and exfiltrates system information to external domains, likely without user consent. The use of suspicious URLs and data encoding indicates potentially malicious intent or covert data leakage. While there is no direct malware like file damage or system hijacking, the code's purpose aligns with covert data collection and exfiltration, raising security concerns.",
