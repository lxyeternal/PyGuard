  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data collection and exfiltration behavior to suspicious domains, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive activity. While it does not contain destructive payloads, its behavior warrants high security concern. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable; I recommend considering a malware score around 0.75 and a security risk score around 0.75, reflecting the covert exfiltration and privacy risks."
