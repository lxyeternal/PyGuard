  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'tronyx' library, defining metadata, dependencies, and project info.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network activity or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from file read and package metadata into setup() call; no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, well-structured setup script with no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file for description, specifies package info, dependencies, and URLs. No dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscated constructs are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or anomalies are detected. The dependency 'requests' is common and harmless. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0, and obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the analysis. The code is safe for use and distribution.",
