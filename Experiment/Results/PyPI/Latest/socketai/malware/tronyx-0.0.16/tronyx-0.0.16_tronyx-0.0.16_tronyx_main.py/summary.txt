  "conclusion": "The code pattern involves transmitting a private key externally without safeguards, raising significant privacy and security concerns. While no malicious code or obfuscation is detected, the behavior is suspicious and could be exploited maliciously. The malware suspicion score should be moderate (~0.2-0.3), and the security risk remains high (~0.75), primarily due to data exfiltration. The code should be flagged for insecure handling of sensitive data and potential misuse, but it does not constitute malware."
