{
  "purpose": "Importing 'perm' from the local 'main' module, likely for use within the current package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'main' module within the same package or directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs in this snippet; it only imports a symbol.",
  "flows": "The imported 'perm' may be used elsewhere; no data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident in the import statement itself.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement importing 'perm' from a relative module named 'main'. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns. As this is only a single line with a relative import, it provides no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. However, the nature of 'perm' and how it is used elsewhere could influence security, but that is outside this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple relative import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues based on the provided fragment.",
