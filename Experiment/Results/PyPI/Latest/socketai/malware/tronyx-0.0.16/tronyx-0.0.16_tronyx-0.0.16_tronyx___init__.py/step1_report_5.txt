  "analysis": "This code is a simple import statement that brings 'perm' from a local module 'main'. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or other actions that could be malicious. There are no hardcoded secrets, environment variable use, or code execution techniques present. The import itself is standard Python practice. The code is extremely minimal, offering no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single line, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and purely functional.",
