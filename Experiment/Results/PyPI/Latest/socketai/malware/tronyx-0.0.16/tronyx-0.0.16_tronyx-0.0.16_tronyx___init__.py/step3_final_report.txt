{
  "purpose": "The code performs a simple relative import of 'perm' from a local module 'main', serving likely as an import statement for further use.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the import does not involve data transfer or execution beyond module import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. Given the minimal code and lack of suspicious activity, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The code's simplicity and standard practice support these conclusions. No further risks or vulnerabilities are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
