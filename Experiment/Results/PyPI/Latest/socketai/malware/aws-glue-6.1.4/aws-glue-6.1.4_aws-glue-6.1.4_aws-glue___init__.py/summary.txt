  "conclusion": "The code is benign in functionality but connects to a suspicious external server, which could be used maliciously. The low malware score reflects the absence of malicious payloads, while the moderate security risk score accounts for the suspicious URL and port. Further investigation into the endpoint's purpose is recommended. Overall, the code poses a potential risk due to external communication but does not contain direct malicious behavior."
