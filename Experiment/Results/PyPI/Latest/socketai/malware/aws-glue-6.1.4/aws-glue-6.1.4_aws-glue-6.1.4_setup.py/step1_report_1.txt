  "purpose": "Define and set up a Python package named 'aws-glue' with a custom post-installation action that makes an HTTP request to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads external URLs via requests.get, particularly to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue'. The setup script reads 'README.md' from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call in post_install() sends data to an external server. The 'README.md' is read without validation, but this is benign.",
  "flows": "The post_install() function executes during installation, sending an HTTP GET request to an external server. This occurs after the package is installed.",
  "anomalies": "The code makes an external network request during package installation, which is unusual and can be used to track or exfiltrate data. The URL 'pov.sh:45111' is suspiciously obfuscated or potentially malicious, especially since the request is repeated without clear purpose. There are no hardcoded credentials or backdoors but executing network calls during setup can be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and third-party 'requests'. It performs an HTTP GET request to an external server ('http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue') during the module load and again explicitly during the post_install() function invoked in the custom install command. This external communication during package installation is suspicious, as it can be used to track users or exfiltrate information without user consent. The URL 'pov.sh:45111' is non-standard and potentially malicious, indicating possible command-and-control or tracking purposes. The rest of the setup code is typical for a Python package, but the network call is anomalous and can be used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes an external network request during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The repeated request to an obscure URL suggests possible tracking or command-and-control behavior. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident, but the side effect of network activity at install time is concerning.",
