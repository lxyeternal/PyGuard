{
  "purpose": "The code performs external network requests to a suspicious URL during import and installation, likely for malicious tracking or command-and-control purposes.",
  "sources": "At module import time and during the post-install step, requests.get() to http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue",
  "sinks": "External network communication to a suspicious domain, potential data exfiltration or remote control",
  "flows": "Import triggers requests.get() -> post_install() triggers requests.get() again",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional external requests during setup, repeated contact to a non-standard, suspicious URL, no validation or user consent",
  "analysis": "The code makes unsolicited external HTTP GET requests during both import and installation phases to a suspicious domain. This behavior is unusual for standard setup scripts and indicates potential malicious activity such as tracking, C&C, or data exfiltration. The URL is obscure, and the repeated contact increases suspicion. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present, but the external contact pattern alone warrants high concern. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75, security risk ~0.85) are justified given the behavior. The code's actions align with malicious or at least highly suspicious activity, justifying high malware and risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious external network activity during package setup, indicative of potential malicious intent. The external URL and repeated contact justify high suspicion and security risk. The scores are appropriate; the behavior warrants caution and likely removal or modification before distribution.",
