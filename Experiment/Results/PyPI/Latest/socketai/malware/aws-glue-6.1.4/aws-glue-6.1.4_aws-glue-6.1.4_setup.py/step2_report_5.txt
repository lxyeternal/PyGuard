  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step and evaluate the code and the associated security concerns.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The setup script imports `requests` and immediately makes a GET request to `http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue`.\n- A `post_install()` function repeats this request.\n- A custom install command (`PostInstallCommand`) runs `post_install()` during package installation.\n- The URL `pov.sh:45111` is suspicious, and making network requests during import and install is unusual for benign packages.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code **does** perform external network requests during import and installation.\n- The URL is non-standard, suspicious, and likely malicious.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or hardcoded secrets beyond the URL.\n- No malicious payloads like backdoors or data theft code are present; however, the network activity itself is a significant concern.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent in identifying the suspicious network requests.\n- They assign high malware and security risk scores (around 0.75–0.85), which aligns with the suspicious external communication.\n- They do not claim actual data exfiltration or malicious payloads but suggest the behavior could be used maliciously.\n- No major logical flaws are apparent; the reports correctly interpret the external requests as suspicious.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware Score:** Ranges from 0.5 to 0.8 across reports.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.75 to 0.85.\n- These seem reasonable given the external requests and their timing.\n\n### Justification for High Scores:\n- The repeated external requests to a suspicious domain during import and install are highly unusual and potentially malicious.\n- External contact to obscure servers during setup can be used for tracking, command-and-control, or data exfiltration.\n- The malware score reflects the potential for malicious intent, which is justified given the context.\n\n### Claims Based on Assumptions:\n- The reports avoid assuming actual malicious payloads; they only flag suspicious behavior.\n- This cautious approach is appropriate.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the behavior described.\n- The higher malware and risk scores are justified by the external network activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0.75 (or higher if considering the repeated suspicious requests)  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Risk Score:** 0.8 (high, due to external communication during setup)\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\nGiven the repeated external requests during import and install, the suspicious URL, and the potential for malicious activity, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.8** — The external contact during setup is a strong indicator of malicious intent, possibly used for command-and-control or tracking.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — No obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk:** **0.9** — The behavior is highly suspicious and poses a significant security risk.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code's behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, primarily due to external network activity during package setup. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but I would lean towards slightly higher malware and risk scores to reflect the severity of the external contact.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways scrutinize packages that perform network requests during setup, especially to obscure or suspicious domains. This behavior is often associated with malicious or unwanted software.",
