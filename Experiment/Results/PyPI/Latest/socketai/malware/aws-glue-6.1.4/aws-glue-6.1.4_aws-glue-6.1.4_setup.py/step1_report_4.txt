{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that installs the package and executes a post-installation request to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for long_description; it makes an HTTP GET request to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue' during import and inside a custom post-installation method.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call to the remote server acts as a sink where untrusted data is sent over the network, potentially exposing user environment or data.",
  "flows": "The code flows from import statements to executing an HTTP GET request at import time, and again during the post-install step, which occurs after package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an HTTP request to an external URL during import and in post-install, which is unusual for standard package setup scripts. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for setup and custom installation. It immediately makes a GET request to a suspicious URL, which could be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration. The post_install function repeats this request after installation, ensuring the remote server is contacted each time the package is installed. The package setup includes standard metadata and dependencies, with a custom command class that runs the external request. There are no indications of code obfuscation, malicious payloads, or attempts to hide behavior. The repeated network call to an external server during import and post-install is suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes such as user tracking, environment fingerprinting, or establishing communication with a command-and-control server.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an external network request during both import and post-install, which is unusual and potentially malicious. This behavior could be used for user tracking or data exfiltration, especially since the URL appears suspicious. No other malicious activities or obfuscation are detected. The overall security risk is high due to the unsolicited network contact.",
