  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of malicious or covert command-and-control scripts: URL obfuscation, SSL verification bypass, and contact with a suspicious domain. While no explicit malicious payload is present, these indicators suggest a high potential for malicious intent. The scores in the reports are appropriate, though slightly underestimating the risk; a malware score of around 0.6 and a security risk of approximately 0.65 better reflect the suspicious nature. The code should be flagged for further analysis, and measures such as enabling SSL verification and avoiding URL obfuscation are recommended to improve security."
