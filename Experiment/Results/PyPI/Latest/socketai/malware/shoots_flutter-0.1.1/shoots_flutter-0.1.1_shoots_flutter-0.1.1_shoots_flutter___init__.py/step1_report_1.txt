{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves system hostname and makes an HTTP request to a base64-encoded URL, appending the hostname as a query parameter, then prints the response content.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), base64.b64decode(), urllib.request.urlopen()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() (network request), response.read(), print()",
  "flows": "hostname is obtained from the system, URL is constructed from decoded base64 string with hostname appended, then a network request is made to that URL, and response content is printed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of _create_unverified_context() disables SSL certificate verification; URL is obfuscated via base64, possibly to hide malicious intent; no validation of response or handling of errors. The URL decodes to 'https://6fddfce6.0wn.sh' which appears suspicious. The code actively contacts an external server, potentially for command and control or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves the local hostname, constructs a URL from a base64-encoded string that decodes to an external domain, and makes an HTTPS request to that URL with SSL verification disabled. Disabling SSL verification can facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks or hide malicious servers. The URL domain appears suspicious, and the obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide intent. The code then reads and prints the server response, which could be used to exfiltrate data or execute commands if the server responds with executable content. The use of base64 to encode the URL adds a layer of obfuscation, common in malicious scripts to evade detection.",
  "conclusion": "The script contacts an external, obfuscated URL with SSL verification disabled, and sends the system hostname as a parameter. This behavior suggests potential malicious activity, such as command-and-control communication or data exfiltration. The obfuscation, combined with the suspicious URL, warrants caution and further investigation.",
