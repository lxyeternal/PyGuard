{
  "purpose": "Configure and package a Python project named 'shoots-flutter' with setup parameters including metadata, packages, and command-line entry points.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from the script's own hardcoded strings for package name, version, author details, description, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function executes with static input; there are no external data sinks or untrusted data flows present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows are present; the script does not process user input or external data streams.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials beyond typical package metadata. No obfuscated code, no malicious backdoors, no hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and entry points. All parameters are static strings, and there is no execution of untrusted input or code. The entry point creates a console script 'shoots-flutter' linked to a function in the 'shoots_flutter' module, which is typical for Python CLI tools. No malicious or suspicious behavior is observed in this configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate package configuration code with no security concerns.",
