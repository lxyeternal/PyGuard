{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for a Python project named 'shoots-flutter' including metadata, packages, and console entry points.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading external input or data sources; uses static package data and metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no handling of untrusted data or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static configuration code without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to configure package metadata and entry points. No external input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs. The entry point references a function 'shoots_flutter' in the 'shoots_flutter' module, but that alone does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no network activity or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign configuration for publishing a Python package.",
