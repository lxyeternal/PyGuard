  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The provided code is a straightforward `setup.py` script using setuptools.\n- All reports correctly identify that the code uses static strings for metadata and entry points.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data input, or obfuscated code is present.\n- The entry point `shoots-flutter=shoots_flutter:shoots_flutter` points to a function within the `shoots_flutter` module; without its implementation, we cannot assess malicious intent, but the setup code itself is benign.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is standard and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code.\n- **Malware, obfuscated code, or security risks:** All reports assign zero scores, which is appropriate given the static, standard nature of the script.\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very close to it, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential inconsistencies or points to challenge:\n- Report 4 assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1 due to the entry point referencing a function that could execute code. While the setup script itself is safe, the actual function implementation could be malicious. However, since the implementation isn't provided, this risk score is somewhat speculative but conservative.\n- The other reports correctly maintain a zero risk score, given the lack of evidence.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- No report assigns a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero, reflecting no malicious activity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The setup code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are all appropriately low.\n- The only slight deviation is Report 4's minimal risk score (0.1), which is a cautious acknowledgment that the entry point could invoke potentially malicious code, but this is a conservative and reasonable stance given the information.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks in the setup script itself.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident from the provided snippet. The scores across reports are consistent and justified.",
