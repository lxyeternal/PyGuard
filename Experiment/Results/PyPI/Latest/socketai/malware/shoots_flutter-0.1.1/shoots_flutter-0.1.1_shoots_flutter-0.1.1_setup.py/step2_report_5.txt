  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The report correctly states that the code is a standard setup script with static strings, no dynamic data, or suspicious code.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No errors or logical flaws.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. This seems appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or security risks.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid, accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, static configuration, no external data or dynamic code.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0, aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The analysis correctly notes that the 'entry_points' could invoke code, but the setup script itself is benign.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0, seems appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** The actual code to be executed resides in the 'shoots_flutter' module, which isn't provided. The setup script itself is safe.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The report mentions that the 'shoots_flutter:shoots_flutter' function could be invoked during execution, which is accurate.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No errors.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1.  \n  - The risk score is slightly above zero because, in theory, executing code from an unverified function could pose a risk, but given only the setup script, this is minimal.  \n  - Malware score remains 0, which is correct since no malicious activity is observed.  \n- **Justification:** The setup script is benign; the actual behavior depends on the implementation of 'shoots_flutter'.  \n- **Conclusion:** Slightly elevated risk score is reasonable, but overall, the setup code remains safe.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; static setup code with no external input or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0, appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the setup script is standard, static, and benign.  \n- The only point of consideration is report 4's slightly elevated security risk score (0.1). Since the setup script references a function that could execute code, but no actual malicious activity or suspicious patterns are present, a risk score of 0.1 seems reasonable but perhaps slightly high given the lack of evidence.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious code.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscated code detected.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the static nature and lack of malicious activity, I would assign a risk score of **0** for all, including report 4, unless there's evidence of malicious behavior in the 'shoots_flutter' module itself.\n\n**Final notes:**  \n- The setup scripts are standard package configuration files, and their security largely depends on the code within the modules they reference.  \n- Since no such code is provided, and all reports correctly identify the benign nature, I agree with their assessments.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- All reports are accurate in their analysis.  \n- The scores are reasonable, with the minor exception of report 4's risk score, which could be lowered to 0.  \n- Overall, the code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation present.",
