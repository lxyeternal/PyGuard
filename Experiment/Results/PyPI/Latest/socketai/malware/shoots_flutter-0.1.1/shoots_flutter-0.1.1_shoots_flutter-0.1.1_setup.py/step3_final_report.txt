  "purpose": "A standard Python package setup script defining package metadata, entry points, and package discovery, with no dynamic or suspicious code.",
  "sources": "Static strings for package info, find_packages() for package discovery, entry_points for CLI script invocation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'shoots_flutter:shoots_flutter' function during CLI invocation; potential for code execution if function is malicious.",
  "flows": "Setup script loads metadata -> user runs CLI -> 'shoots_flutter' function executes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration. The entry point references a function which could execute code, but this is standard for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static metadata, package discovery, and an entry point for CLI. No dynamic code, obfuscated patterns, or secrets are present. The only potential concern is the invocation of 'shoots_flutter:shoots_flutter' during execution, but without its implementation, this cannot be deemed malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is effectively 0, with a minimal cautious note in one report (0.1) justified by the possibility of code execution, but lacking evidence of malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the static analysis.",
