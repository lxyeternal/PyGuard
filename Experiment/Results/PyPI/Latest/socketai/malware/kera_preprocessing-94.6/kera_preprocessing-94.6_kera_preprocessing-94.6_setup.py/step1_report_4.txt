  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'kera_preprocessing' Python package that customizes installation behavior by executing code after installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from setuptools and the custom 'run' method in 'CrazyInstallStrat' which executes 'from main import main' during installation.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' in the 'run' method, which executes code from the 'main' module after installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the flow proceeds from setup invocation to the 'run' method of 'CrazyInstallStrat', which then imports and executes 'main()' from the 'main' module.",
  "anomalies": "The execution of 'main()' upon installation is unusual and potentially suspicious, as it runs arbitrary code post-installation. The actual behavior depends on the contents of 'main', which is not shown.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the 'run' method to execute 'main()' from a 'main' module after installation. This behavior is atypical, as standard setup scripts do not execute arbitrary code post-installation. The presence of this pattern could be benign, such as initialization, but it could also be exploited to run malicious code if 'main' contains malicious logic. Without access to 'main', the exact intent cannot be determined, but executing code during installation is a notable risk indicator.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard package setup but includes a suspicious post-installation step that executes an external 'main()' function. This behavior warrants caution, as it could potentially execute malicious code. The overall risk is moderate due to the unconventional code execution during install.",
