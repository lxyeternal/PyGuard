{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'kera_preprocessing' package, including custom installation behavior that executes a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'setup' parameters, imports 'main' from main.py during installation.",
  "sinks": "The code executes 'main()' from main.py, which could be malicious if 'main' contains harmful code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the flow runs from the install command to executing 'main()' from main.py.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes a function from main.py during installation, which is unusual and could be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses setuptools to configure package installation. It defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, after performing standard installation, imports and executes 'main()' from main.py. This behavior is unconventional and potentially malicious if 'main()' performs malicious actions (e.g., network activity, system modifications). The package dependencies are standard ('requests', 'psutil') with no suspicious packages. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code, but executing arbitrary code during installation poses a security risk. The purpose seems to be to run code from main.py post-installation, which could be used maliciously to perform unauthorized actions on the user's system.",
  "conclusion": "The code's key concern is executing 'main()' from main.py during installation, which could be malicious depending on the contents of 'main.py'. The setup script itself appears standard, but the execution of external code at install time is suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
