  "purpose": "Define a setup configuration for the 'kera_preprocessing' package with a custom installation step that executes a function from 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code imports from 'setuptools' and calls 'main()' from 'main' during installation.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function is invoked at the end of the installation process, which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method executes, which calls 'main()' from 'main' module.",
  "anomalies": "The custom installation class automatically executes 'main()' after installation without any validation or restrictions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, upon running, imports and executes 'main()' from a local 'main' module. This behavior is unusual because installation scripts typically do not execute arbitrary functions from local modules. Executing 'main()' during setup can be exploited to run malicious code, install backdoors, or perform unwanted actions on the user's system. The rest of the setup code appears standard, with dependencies declared. However, the automatic execution of 'main()' during installation is a potential security concern, as it allows arbitrary code execution at install time.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes a custom installation step that automatically runs 'main()' from a local module during installation, which could be malicious or maliciously exploited. This pattern is suspicious and warrants further investigation into the 'main' module's content. Overall, the code presents a significant security risk due to this automatic execution behavior.",
