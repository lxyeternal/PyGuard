  "conclusion": "The code executes 'main()' during installation, which is a security concern due to potential maliciousness if 'main()' is untrusted. The pattern is suspicious but not definitively malicious. The risk and malware scores should be moderate to high if 'main()' is untrusted, with a high security risk score (~0.75). The overall assessment is that this pattern poses a significant security concern and warrants further review of 'main()' before trusting or deploying."
