  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation step that executes code from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The custom run method in CrazyInstallStrat imports and executes main() from main.py after installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() can lead to arbitrary code execution if main() contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method executes, which then imports and runs main() from main.py.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class runs a function from main.py unconditionally after installation, which is unusual for package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'kera_preprocessing'. It includes a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the run() method to call the standard install process and then immediately imports and executes main() from main.py. This post-install execution of arbitrary code is uncommon and potentially dangerous, as it could run malicious code if main.py is compromised or malicious. The setup uses standard dependencies and does not contain obfuscation or unusual language features. The main concern is the unconditional execution of main() upon installation, which could be exploited to run malicious code without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious behavior by executing code from main.py immediately after installation, which could be used for malicious purposes. This pattern is suspicious and warrants caution, especially if the contents of main.py are untrusted or malicious.",
