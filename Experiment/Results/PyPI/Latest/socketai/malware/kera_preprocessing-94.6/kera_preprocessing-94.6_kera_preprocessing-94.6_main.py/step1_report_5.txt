  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "Platform information (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), MAC addresses (get_mac_addresses function), and random number generator (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external URLs constructed with encoded data and query parameters, using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Data from system information sources flows into URL query parameters, which are sent via HTTP requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for MAC addresses, multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, and transmission of system data without encryption or user consent. The URLs appear malicious or for tracking/command-and-control purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system-specific information such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, possibly to obfuscate data. The script constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains, appending the encoded data and a random number as query parameters. It then makes HTTP GET requests to these URLs without any validation or user consent. The domains appear malicious or used for tracking purposes, and data is sent over unencrypted HTTP, which could be exploited for data exfiltration. The use of multiple URLs and encoding suggests an attempt to obfuscate data collection and exfiltration activities. No explicit malicious payloads or commands are executed, but the behavior indicates potential privacy violation, data leakage, or command-and-control communication.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to secretly collect and exfiltrate system information to potentially malicious domains, indicating malicious intent. It exhibits suspicious behavior through data collection and covert transmission over HTTP, with obfuscated encoding of sensitive data. This code poses a security risk and should be considered malicious.",
