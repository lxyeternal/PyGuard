  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, then encode and transmit this data to external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function, input data from system commands and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send data over the network to external URLs.",
  "flows": "Collected system data (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) is encoded in base64, included in URL parameters, and transmitted to remote servers via HTTP GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, encoding MAC addresses and other info, and making network requests without user consent or indication. No explicit data validation or user notification.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system info, including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, potentially to obfuscate the data. It constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to external domains that appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate services. The network activity is hidden within a try-except block, ignoring errors, which could be used for covert data exfiltration. The code does not perform any legitimate function but instead seems designed to collect and transmit potentially sensitive data stealthily.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system identifiers and transmits them covertly to external servers under suspicious domains. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration malware or spyware. The code's purpose appears malicious, aiming to harvest and send system info without user awareness.",
