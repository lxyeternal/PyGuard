  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple external URLs via GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (which reads MAC addresses via system commands).",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls with constructed URLs containing encoded system data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info and MAC addresses) are encoded and appended as URL parameters in HTTP GET requests to external URLs, potentially transmitting untrusted data to third-party servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, base64 encoding MAC addresses before transmission, and gathering extensive system information. The URLs are obfuscated or custom, possibly used for covert data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses from the system. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, possibly to obfuscate data. The data is sent via HTTP GET requests to three external URLs, which appear suspicious and could be used for covert data exfiltration. The code does not sanitize data before transmission but relies on external URLs to receive system info. No malicious commands like system backdoors, data theft, or malicious payloads are present, but the behavior of transmitting system data to unknown servers raises security concerns. The code’s purpose seems to be stealthy data collection and transmission, which could be part of malicious activity or a malicious supply chain attack.",
  "conclusion": "The code is collecting and transmitting system information to external suspicious URLs without user consent. It appears to serve as a potential data exfiltration mechanism. While no direct malicious payloads are evident, the behavior is suspicious and could facilitate covert malicious activities, especially given the nature of the URLs.",
