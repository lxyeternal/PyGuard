  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it via HTTP requests to specific external URLs, possibly for tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network interfaces, and the list of URLs being iterated over.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls which send data to external URLs with query parameters containing system info; base64-encoded MAC addresses embedded in URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) is encoded and included as URL query parameters, then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or suspicious URLs likely controlled by an attacker, including unusual domain names. Base64 encoding of MAC addresses might be an attempt to obscure data. No input validation or response handling, and no obvious purpose beyond data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system details including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are encoded in base64. The code then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends system info as URL parameters via GET requests. The URLs appear malicious or at least suspicious, possibly used for tracking or reconnaissance. The code does not process responses, and exception handling suppresses errors. The behavior strongly suggests covert data collection and transmission, consistent with malicious or tracking activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears designed for covertly gathering system information and exfiltrating it to external malicious domains, indicative of potentially malicious behavior. There is no indication of malicious payload execution or backdoors, but the data exfiltration pattern is suspicious and aligns with reconnaissance activities.",
