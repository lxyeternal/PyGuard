      "conclusion": "The code executes 'main()' during installation, which is a security concern due to potential maliciousness if 'main()' is untrusted. The pattern is suspicious but not definitively malicious. The risk and malware scores should be moderate to high if 'main()' is untrusted, with a high security risk score (~0.75). The overall assessment is that this pattern poses a significant security concern and warrants further review of 'main()' before trusting or deploying."

      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious or spyware-like behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a high malware score (~0.8) and security risk (~0.8). The obfuscation level is minimal. Overall, the code should be considered malicious or highly suspicious, warranting high security concern."
