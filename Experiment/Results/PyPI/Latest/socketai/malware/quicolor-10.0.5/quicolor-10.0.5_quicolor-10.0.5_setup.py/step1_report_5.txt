  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the 'quicolor' Python library",
  "sources": "User inputs for package metadata, installation requirements, and URLs",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs; no data leaks or unsafe operations",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code solely configures package setup with static data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution. All data is static and typical for a Python package setup. There are no inputs from external sources or dynamic code execution. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The only dependencies are 'requests', which is a common library, and all other fields are standard metadata. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks.",
