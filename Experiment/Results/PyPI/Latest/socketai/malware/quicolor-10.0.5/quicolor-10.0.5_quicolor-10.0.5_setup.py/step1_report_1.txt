  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'quicolor' to specify metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Input data from package parameters, external URL, and dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "Installation process and package metadata, no direct data leaks or malicious data flows.",
  "flows": "N/A, standard setup process with no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration using setuptools. It declares package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, no data collection, nor suspicious behavior is present. External URL and author information are standard and not suspicious. The 'install_requires' includes only 'requests', a common library, with no unusual or malicious dependencies. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and legitimate.",
