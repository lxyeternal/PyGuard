  "purpose": "Telemetry logging during simulation initialization and execution",
  "sources": "Calls to send_telemetry within __init__ and simulate methods, imported dynamically inside methods",
  "sinks": "send_telemetry function potentially transmitting data externally or logging locally",
  "flows": "Initialization and simulation methods invoke send_telemetry with specific event strings",
  "anomalies": "Repeated local imports of send_telemetry inside methods; no other suspicious code or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports send_telemetry dynamically within methods, which is unusual but not malicious. It calls the function with event strings, likely for telemetry purposes. No evidence of data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or obfuscation. The pattern suggests potential privacy considerations if send_telemetry transmits sensitive data, but no malicious activity is demonstrated. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (0.2), reflecting minor privacy concerns. The code is straightforward and benign, with no logical flaws or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign telemetry logging with an unusual import pattern. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident. Privacy concerns depend on send_telemetry's implementation, but based solely on this snippet, the risk remains minimal.",
