  "purpose": "The code initializes telemetry data collection and sends environment information upon package import and exit.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('BANCOR_DISABLE_TELEMETRY'), platform.python_version(), platform.system(), platform.machine()",
  "sinks": "requests.post(WEBHOOK_URL, json=payload, timeout=1)",
  "flows": "Environment data is gathered from sources and sent via POST request to a specified webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "The code silently suppresses exceptions in telemetry sending; uses a hardcoded webhook URL; collects system info without user consent; enables telemetry by default unless explicitly disabled.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines a telemetry function that collects environment data and sends it to a webhook URL unless disabled via environment variable. It automatically sends telemetry upon import and exit. No code executes external commands, manipulates files, or accesses sensitive user data beyond environment info. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which could be used for tracking or data collection without explicit user knowledge. The telemetry is passive and does not alter system behavior or compromise security directly. The silent exception handling prevents detection of failures but doesn't introduce malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for environment telemetry collection, which can be considered privacy-invasive but does not exhibit malicious or harmful behavior. No malware or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
