  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining metadata, dependencies, and package locations.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' without exception handling, but this is typical in setup scripts and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input beyond reading a local file. All reports correctly identify it as benign. The use of 'open' without exception handling is a minor concern but not a security risk. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified and consistent across analyses. No suspicious patterns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
  "confidence": 1,
