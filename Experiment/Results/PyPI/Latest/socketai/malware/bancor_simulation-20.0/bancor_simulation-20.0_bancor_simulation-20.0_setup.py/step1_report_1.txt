  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'bancor-simulation' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file to load the long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The source reading 'README.md' flows into the 'long_description' parameter of 'setup()'.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'open' directly without handling potential exceptions; however, this is typical for setup scripts. No suspicious or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' functions to configure package installation. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package locations. The 'long_description' is read from 'README.md' without validation, which could cause issues if the file is maliciously altered, but this is standard practice. There are no suspicious code flows, no dynamic code execution, and no external data sources or sinks involved. The code's structure is straightforward and conventional for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only reads a file for descriptive purposes and does not execute any untrusted code or handle sensitive data insecurely.",
