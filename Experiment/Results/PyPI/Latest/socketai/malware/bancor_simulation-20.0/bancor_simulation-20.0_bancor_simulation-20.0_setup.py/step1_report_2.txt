{
  "purpose": "Configure the packaging and distribution of the 'bancor-simulation' Python project, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "N/A (configuration script; does not read external data during execution)",
  "sinks": "N/A (does not perform actions that can lead to data leaks or security effects)",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from sources to sinks within this script)",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open' to read 'README.md' without handling potential exceptions, but this is standard in setup scripts and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and package locations. The only notable operation is reading 'README.md' for the long description, which is typical. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no network connections, and no code execution beyond static configuration. The code appears clean and conventional, with no signs of malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could harm the system or leak data.",
