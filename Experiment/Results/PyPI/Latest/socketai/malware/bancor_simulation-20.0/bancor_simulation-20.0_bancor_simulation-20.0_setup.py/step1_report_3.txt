{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'bancor-simulation' Python package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The 'long_description' reads content from the 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data is used in a harmful way; no network or sensitive data operations present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading 'README.md' into 'long_description', with no other input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of standard setup tools and package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. It reads 'README.md' for the long description, specifies dependencies, and includes metadata. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code, is present. The reading of 'README.md' is a common practice and not malicious. The package metadata appears legitimate and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies, with safe handling of file reading.",
