  "purpose": "Custom installation process that collects system information and sends it via a webhook",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls to gather system info (uname, ifconfig, curl, whoami, hostname, tasklist), os.system() to send data to Slack webhook",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing a curl command to send collected data to external URL",
  "flows": "Data collected from os.popen() calls flows into the string formatted in the curl command, which is then executed via os.system() to send data externally",
  "anomalies": "Extensive system information collection and sending data to an external webhook without user consent; use of os.popen() and os.system() for command execution; hardcoded URL for Slack webhook; collection of potentially sensitive data like hostname, username, OS info, and IP addresses",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, executes multiple system commands to gather system info such as OS details, IP addresses, username, hostname, and process list. It then constructs a message containing this data and sends it via a curl command to a Slack webhook URL. The use of os.popen() and os.system() indicates executing shell commands, which can be risky if manipulated or if the commands are altered. The code collects potentially sensitive data and transmits it to an external server, which could be malicious or maliciously used for data exfiltration. There are no obfuscation techniques; the code appears straightforward, but the behavior resembles data exfiltration, a typical malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects detailed system information and sends it to an external webhook, which could be used for malicious purposes such as unauthorized data collection or backdoor activity. No clear benign purpose justifies this data collection behavior. The code exhibits behaviors consistent with potential malware or data exfiltration activity.",
