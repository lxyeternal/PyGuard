  "purpose": "Custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to a remote Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Reading system information using os.popen() (uname, ifconfig, systeminfo, ipconfig, curl), executing system commands with os.system().",
  "sinks": "Sending data via curl command to a Slack webhook URL with embedded data.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, user info) are collected through os.popen() and os.system(), then injected into a curl command that posts data to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of os.popen() and os.system() to collect system information, and immediately sending collected data over the network without any validation or user consent. Use of hardcoded Slack webhook URL; no checks or obfuscation. The data includes hostname, username, public IP, and OS info, which could be sensitive.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that overrides the run method. During installation, it collects various system information depending on the OS platform using os.popen() calls, then formats this data into a JSON string. It then sends this data to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL via an os.system() call executing curl. The data collection and transmission happen automatically during package installation, with no user consent or clear purpose. The use of hardcoded URL and the gathering of potentially sensitive info suggest malicious intent, particularly if used without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely malicious or at least highly suspicious, as it secretly gathers system information and exfiltrates it to an external server during package installation. This behavior could be used for reconnaissance, data theft, or surveillance without user consent.",
