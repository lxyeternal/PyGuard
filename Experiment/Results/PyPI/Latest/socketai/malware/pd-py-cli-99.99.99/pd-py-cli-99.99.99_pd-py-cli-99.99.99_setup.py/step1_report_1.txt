  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to gather system information and send it via a webhook",
  "sources": "Reading system info via os.popen (uname, ifconfig, curl, hostname, whoami, systeminfo, ipconfig), current working directory",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a curl command to POST data to a Slack webhook URL",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, user info) -> os.popen/os.system -> data sent via HTTP POST to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.popen and os.system for executing shell commands to collect system info and send it to an external URL; no clear necessity for this data collection in a typical install process",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command in setuptools to run additional steps during package installation. It collects system information such as OS details, IP addresses, hostname, username, and current directory by executing shell commands. It then constructs a JSON payload containing this info and sends it to a Slack webhook URL via a curl command. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the data transmission is done without any apparent user consent or transparency. This behavior is highly suspicious, as it could be used for data exfiltration or system fingerprinting without user knowledge. The use of subprocesses to gather environment details and send them externally during installation is atypical and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and transmitting it to an external webhook during package installation. This is indicative of a privacy violation and possible malicious intent. The hardcoded webhook URL and system info gathering without user awareness are serious red flags.",
