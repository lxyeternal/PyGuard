  "purpose": "Custom installation script that collects system information and sends it via a webhook.",
  "sources": "os.popen('uname -a'), os.popen('ifconfig'), os.popen('curl ifconfig.me'), os.popen('systeminfo'), os.popen('ipconfig'), os.popen('whoami'), os.popen('hostname')",
  "sinks": "os.system('curl -X POST ...')",
  "flows": "sources (system info commands) -> collected data -> formatted into JSON payload -> sent via os.system call to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.popen to execute multiple system commands that gather potentially sensitive system data; sends data to a Slack webhook URL, which could be misused for exfiltration or logging",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install process to gather detailed system information across different OS platforms, including hostname, user identity, network configuration, and public IP address. It then sends this data to a specified Slack webhook URL via a curl command embedded in os.system(). The webhook URL appears hardcoded, and the data sent includes potentially sensitive information such as hostname, user identity, and network configuration, which could be used for malicious reconnaissance or privacy invasion. The code does not perform any malicious activity like system damage, data theft, or remote access but does exfiltrate system details without user consent. The use of system commands to collect info and send it externally is suspicious and could be misused in malicious scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The script is not outright malware but exhibits malicious-like behavior by collecting detailed system information and transmitting it to an external webhook, which could be used for reconnaissance or data exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and gathering of sensitive data warrants concern. Overall, the code poses a security risk due to its data collection and external transmission functionality.",
