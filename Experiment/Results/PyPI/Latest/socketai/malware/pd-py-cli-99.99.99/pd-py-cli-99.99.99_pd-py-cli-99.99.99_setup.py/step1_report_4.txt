{
  "purpose": "Custom installation script for the 'pd-py-cli' package that gathers system information and sends it via a webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads system details using os.popen() (uname, ifconfig, systeminfo, ipconfig, hostname, whoami), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and other system commands.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call that executes a curl POST request to a Slack webhook, transmitting collected system information.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, user info, hostname, current directory) feed into the data payload for the curl command, which then sends this untrusted data to an external server (Slack webhook).",
  "anomalies": "The script collects detailed system info (including potentially sensitive details) and transmits it to an external endpoint without explicit user consent. Use of 'os.popen()' for command execution and data transmission to a remote URL is suspicious; no input validation or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the setuptools install process, gathering system info such as OS details, IP configuration, hostname, and user info via system commands. It then constructs a JSON payload with this info and sends it via a POST request to a Slack webhook URL. No user input is processed, but the collection and transmission of system data without disclosure is potentially malicious, indicating possible data exfiltration or surveillance. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and commands to gather system info could be exploited to gather sensitive data. The overall behavior resembles data leakage or reconnaissance activity, especially since the info is sent to an external service.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs potentially malicious data collection and exfiltration by gathering comprehensive system details and sending them to an external webhook without user consent. While it may be intended for diagnostics, its behavior aligns with covert data harvesting, representing a security concern.",
