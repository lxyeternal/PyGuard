  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no explicit malicious payloads. The presence of obfuscation and dynamic eval in some snippets warrants moderate concern, but without concrete malicious actions, the overall threat level remains low. Slightly increasing malware suspicion in code with obfuscation and eval is justified. The overall security risk is estimated at 0.2, with obfuscation at 0.1, and malware at 0.2."
