{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly defined; the code does not read from external data sources, user input, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code executes internal functions without external data dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated sections, or unusual code constructs are detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module with functions and possibly class definitions. It does not contain dynamic execution, network calls, or file operations that could pose security risks. It also does not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to injection or leakage. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident based on the provided snippet. Given the absence of external dependencies or network activity, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to be a standard utility or processing script with no indicators of supply chain attack vectors or malware. The confidence level is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
