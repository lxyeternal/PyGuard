  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include environment variables, user inputs, external data; sinks include network calls, file operations, system commands.",
  "sinks": "Network activity, file I/O, system commands, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs flow into code execution, network calls, or file operations, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec, suspicious network calls, inconsistent or incomplete code snippets, hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. Network activity or data exfiltration patterns would elevate suspicion. Benign code lacks obfuscation and suspicious network or file operations. Limited code context reduces confidence but the presence of obfuscation and dynamic eval suggests moderate suspicion. The overall pattern indicates low to moderate risk, with the highest suspicion in code with obfuscation and dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no explicit malicious payloads. The presence of obfuscation and dynamic eval in some snippets warrants moderate concern, but without concrete malicious actions, the overall threat level remains low. Slightly increasing malware suspicion in code with obfuscation and eval is justified. The overall security risk is estimated at 0.2, with obfuscation at 0.1, and malware at 0.2.",
