  "sinks": "None; static configuration without untrusted data or network activity.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without exception handling for 'README.md', but this is common and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor issue is the lack of error handling when opening 'README.md', which does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate.",
