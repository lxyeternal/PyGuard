{
  "purpose": "Package initialization by importing the ColorPrint class from the local core module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only exposes a class for use within the package.",
  "flows": "Static import flow; no data or control flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement used in Python package setup. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization import statement with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
