  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, input, or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources; only static import",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement importing a class from a relative module. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data handling. The structure is typical for Python package initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to expose the ColorPrint class in the package namespace. No malicious activity or security risks detected.",
