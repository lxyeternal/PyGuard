  "conclusion": "The provided reports collectively indicate that the open source dependency is safe, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analyses. Minor adjustments could be made to lower the security risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 for a more conservative estimate, but the current scores are acceptable. Overall, the dependency appears secure based on the available information."
