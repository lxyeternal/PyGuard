  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes or functions from local submodules and defines an export list for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; merely importing and exporting symbols",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; only straightforward imports and exports",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes or functions from sibling modules and declares an export list. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or security-sensitive operations. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. No anomalies, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident based on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initializer with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It solely imports and exports components for package use.",
