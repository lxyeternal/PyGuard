  "purpose": "This code appears to define the exports of a Python module by importing specific classes or functions from local modules and exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static import and export declarations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple relative imports from local modules and defines an explicit list of exported symbols. It is a standard module initialization pattern with no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, and no external data communication. The code is minimal and straightforward, indicating no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export statement with no malicious behavior or security issues identified. It poses no security threat.",
