  "purpose": "Organize and expose internal classes/functions for external use via __all__.",
  "sources": "Relative imports from sibling modules (.ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external communication, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Imports from sibling modules -> __all__ declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern with no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple relative imports of classes/functions from sibling modules and defines __all__ to specify public API. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network communication is present. The code is static, clear, and standard for module initialization. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with high confidence. The structure and behavior are consistent with a standard Python package module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module for organizing imports and exports. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
