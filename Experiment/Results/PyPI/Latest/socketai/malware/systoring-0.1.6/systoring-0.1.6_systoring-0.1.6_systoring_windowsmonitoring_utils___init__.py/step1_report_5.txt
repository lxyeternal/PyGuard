{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes or functions from relative submodules and defines an explicit public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; no external data handling or output functions present",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports modules and declares exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules and an explicit export list. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modification. The import statements are relative, indicating internal module dependencies. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module that imports classes or functions from sibling modules and declares its public interface. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The low complexity and lack of external interactions suggest it is safe.",
