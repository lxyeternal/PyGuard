  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'systoring' Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks identified; no network or sensitive data handling in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only reads a local file and sets package parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It reads a README file for the long description, defines package info, dependencies, and optional extras for different OS. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed; it does not perform any runtime operations beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, typical Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
