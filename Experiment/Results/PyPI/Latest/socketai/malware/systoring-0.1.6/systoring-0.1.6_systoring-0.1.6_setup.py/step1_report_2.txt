  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'systoring', intended for system monitoring with a focus on cross-platform compatibility and educational use.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; uses find_packages() to identify package modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or direct data processing occurs in this code; it primarily prepares package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code present. Usage of package versioning and environment specifications appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, reads a markdown file for description, and defines package setup parameters including dependencies. No code execution, input handling, or network operations occur here. The dependencies are typical for system monitoring tools, and there are platform-specific optional dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly specifies dependencies and package metadata without suspicious or harmful elements.",
