  "purpose": "This code is used to configure the packaging and distribution of a Python library called 'systoring'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; data is static in setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is written or transmitted outside the setup process.",
  "flows": "The flow is static configuration for package setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements are present; all code is standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, reads a markdown file for description, and configures package metadata, dependencies, and optional requirements. It does not include any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors are detected. The dependencies listed are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It serves the purpose of package configuration only.",
