{
  "purpose": "This code defines an export for the 'AbstractSender' class imported from the local 'sender' module, likely part of a larger package's API.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .sender import AbstractSender",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing; only an import and an export list",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; minimal code with straightforward import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports 'AbstractSender' from a local module and explicitly exposes it via __all__. No data processing, user input, or external data handling occurs. No suspicious or malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The structure is typical for Python packages aiming to control API exposure.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exports an abstract class for use elsewhere.",
