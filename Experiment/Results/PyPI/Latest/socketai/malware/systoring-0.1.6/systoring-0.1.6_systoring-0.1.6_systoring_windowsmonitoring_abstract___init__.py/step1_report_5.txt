{
  "purpose": "This module re-exports the AbstractSender class from the sender module, likely for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .sender import AbstractSender' which accesses a local module 'sender'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is being written to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are observable; the code only performs an import and an export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual or suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named AbstractSender from a relative module named sender and exposes it via __all__. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic. The code appears to be a simple re-export pattern. No indicators of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module re-export with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It simply makes the AbstractSender class available for external import.",
