  "purpose": "Initialize platform-specific system monitoring threads for macOS and Windows.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for OS detection, threading.Thread for thread creation, class methods for monitoring tasks.",
  "sinks": "Thread start method executing monitor functions.",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> conditional logic -> thread creation -> thread start -> execution of monitor methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system and launches monitoring threads accordingly. It imports monitoring classes, creates threads for their run methods, and starts them. No data is being sent externally, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded secrets. The monitoring functions are invoked in separate threads, which is typical for background tasks. The code structure appears standard and intended for system monitoring purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a platform-specific system monitoring initializer with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility for process monitoring on macOS and Windows without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
