  "purpose": "Initialize and start platform-specific system monitoring threads for Mac or Windows.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call to determine OS; InputMonitor().start_monitoring() thread; platform-specific monitor class instantiation and run method",
  "sinks": "None identified; code does not process untrusted data for output or network activity",
  "flows": "platform.system() output determines which monitor thread is started; InputMonitor thread runs independently",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious control flow; standard platform detection and thread spawning",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system and starts monitoring threads accordingly. It imports modules and creates threads to run monitoring functions. The use of threading and platform detection appears typical for system monitoring purposes. No obfuscated code, data leaks, or malicious network activity is evident. The import statements seem related to legitimate monitoring functions. No suspicious data handling or external communication is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard system monitoring setup for Mac and Windows platforms without malicious intent. It does not exhibit suspicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
