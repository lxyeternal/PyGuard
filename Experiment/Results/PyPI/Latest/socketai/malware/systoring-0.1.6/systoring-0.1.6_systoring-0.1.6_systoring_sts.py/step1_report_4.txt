  "purpose": "Initialize and start platform-specific system monitoring threads for macOS and Windows.",
  "sources": "Reads platform information via platform.system() and input_monitor.start() method.",
  "sinks": "Starts monitoring threads that run potentially platform-specific monitoring functions.",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> condition checks -> threading.Thread() -> start() -> monitoring functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code behaviors, no obfuscated code. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system and starts corresponding monitoring threads. The use of threading appears standard for such tasks. The imported modules suggest system monitoring functions, but there is no evidence of malicious activity or data leakage. No hidden backdoors, external communications, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward platform-specific monitoring initialization routine. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
