  "conclusion": "The code is a typical platform-dependent monitoring setup with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk (~0.2-0.3)—are justified and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary; continued review of imported modules is recommended for comprehensive security assurance."
