      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward platform-aware module loader with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly 0. The security risk score could be conservatively set at 0, given the lack of any suspicious activity or vulnerabilities, but some reports have used 0.1 as a cautious estimate. Overall, the code is safe and aligns with best practices for conditional imports."

The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk (~0.2-0.3)—are justified and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary; continued review of imported modules is recommended for comprehensive security assurance."

While no explicit malicious payloads are visible, the combination of extensive data access and SSL bypass warrants a malware score of approximately 0.6 and a security risk score of about 0.7."

The primary risk is if the '_create_unverified_https' method is invoked during runtime, which could expose systems to MITM attacks. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a moderate security risk score around 0.3."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily anti-analysis and environment detection, common in malware but not inherently malicious. It could be part of a malicious package or used for legitimate anti-debugging purposes. The malware score should be moderate, reflecting its anti-analysis nature without explicit payloads. The overall security risk is moderate due to its potential to hinder forensic analysis and evade detection, but it does not contain active malicious payloads in this snippet."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits characteristics of a malicious downloader capable of executing arbitrary remote code silently and covertly. Its design allows for potential abuse in malicious contexts, justifying high malware and security risk scores. The lack of validation and error reporting further exacerbates its threat profile."
