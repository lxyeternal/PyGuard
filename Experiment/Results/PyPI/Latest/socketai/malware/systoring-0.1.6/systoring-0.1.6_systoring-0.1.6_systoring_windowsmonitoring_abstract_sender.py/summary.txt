  "conclusion": "This is a standard abstract class with a security concern related to disabling SSL verification. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary risk is if the '_create_unverified_https' method is invoked during runtime, which could expose systems to MITM attacks. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a moderate security risk score around 0.3."
