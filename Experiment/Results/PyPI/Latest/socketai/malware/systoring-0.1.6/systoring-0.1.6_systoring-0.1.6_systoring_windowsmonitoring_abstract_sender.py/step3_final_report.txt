  "purpose": "Defines an abstract class template for data sender modules, including a method to disable SSL verification, which can pose security risks if misused.",
  "sources": "The static method '_create_unverified_https' that overrides SSL context to disable certificate verification.",
  "sinks": "Global SSL context modification affecting all HTTPS connections, potentially enabling man-in-the-middle attacks if invoked during runtime.",
  "flows": "Invocation of '_create_unverified_https' affects subsequent HTTPS requests by disabling SSL verification globally.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a method that disables SSL verification globally without safeguards or context checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract sender class with a method to disable SSL verification, which is a known security risk if used improperly. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The risk depends on whether this method is invoked during runtime; the code itself is standard and straightforward. The malware score is zero, and obfuscation is absent. The security risk score is moderate (~0.3) due to the potential for misuse, but no active malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard abstract class with a security concern related to disabling SSL verification. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary risk is if the '_create_unverified_https' method is invoked during runtime, which could expose systems to MITM attacks. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a moderate security risk score around 0.3.",
