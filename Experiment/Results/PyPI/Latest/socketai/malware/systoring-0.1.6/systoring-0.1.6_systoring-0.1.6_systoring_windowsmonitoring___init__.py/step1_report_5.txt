  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a module that imports classes and enums for Windows monitoring and utility functions, likely for a larger security or monitoring application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external sources or destinations are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import and export statement for a Python package. It imports classes and enums from local modules and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code practices. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. No external data handling, system commands, or network operations are present. No anomalies or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer with no indications of malicious activity or security risks. It serves to expose specific classes and enums for use in other parts of the application without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
