  "purpose": "Module initialization script importing internal classes and constants to expose them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py style module setup, importing specific classes and constants from internal modules and exposing them via __all__. It contains no data processing, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The code is standard for package interface definition and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns. The scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
