{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package's __init__.py file, meant to define the public interface by importing and exposing specific modules and classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform dangerous operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and declares __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and constants from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, which is a standard practice for package initialization. It does not execute any dynamic code, process external input, or perform network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The minimal structure indicates a typical package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script that exposes certain components of a package. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this code snippet.",
