{
  "purpose": "The code defines module exports by importing specific classes and variables from relative modules within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils)",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; the code only imports and exports components",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up module interface",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports classes and constants from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or system modifications. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple interface setup for a package, with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
