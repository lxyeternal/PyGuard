  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward platform-aware module loader with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly 0. The security risk score could be conservatively set at 0, given the lack of any suspicious activity or vulnerabilities, but some reports have used 0.1 as a cautious estimate. Overall, the code is safe and aligns with best practices for conditional imports."
