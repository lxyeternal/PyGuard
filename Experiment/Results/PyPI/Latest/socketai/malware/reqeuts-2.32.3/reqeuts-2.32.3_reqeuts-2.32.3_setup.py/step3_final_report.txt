{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the 'requests' Python package, handling version checks, metadata loading, and publishing commands.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__version__.py' via exec(), reads README.md, and processes command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Executes code from '__version__.py' using exec(), runs shell commands with os.system() for publishing.",
  "flows": "Source: reading version file -> sink: exec() executes version code; Source: command-line 'publish' argument -> sink: os.system() runs build/upload commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on external version file; use of os.system() for publishing commands; no hardcoded secrets or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with typical patterns. exec() on version info can be risky if the file is compromised, and os.system() commands could be dangerous if inputs are manipulated. However, in controlled environments, these are common practices. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The main concern is ensuring the integrity of the version file. The script itself does not exhibit malicious behavior, and the use of exec() and os.system() is standard but should be protected against tampering.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration with minimal security risks. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is found. The primary security consideration is safeguarding the version file from tampering. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical risks associated with executing external code and shell commands in setup scripts.",
