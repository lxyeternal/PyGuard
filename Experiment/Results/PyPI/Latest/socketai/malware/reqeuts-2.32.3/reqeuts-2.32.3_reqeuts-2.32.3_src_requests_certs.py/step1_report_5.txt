  "purpose": "Provide the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' function from the certifi package and calling it in the main block.",
  "sinks": "Printing the CA bundle path; no untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Main block calls 'where()' and outputs its value directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs a straightforward task with no hidden or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library function from 'certifi' to retrieve the default CA bundle path and prints it. It contains no user input, no network activity, no sensitive data handling, nor any obfuscated or malicious code. The code is simple and appears to serve a utility purpose only.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign script designed to output the location of the certifi CA bundle. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
