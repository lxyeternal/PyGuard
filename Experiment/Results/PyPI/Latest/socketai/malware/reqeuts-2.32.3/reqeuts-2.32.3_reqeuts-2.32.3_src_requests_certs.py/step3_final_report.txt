{
  "purpose": "The code outputs the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package, serving as a utility to identify SSL verification resources.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' and the print statement when executed directly.",
  "sinks": "The code only prints a static path; no untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' as a source, followed by printing its value as the sink; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a trusted library function and prints its output without any external input, network activity, or data manipulation. It performs a benign utility function with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with its behavior. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that safely outputs the path to the default CA bundle. There are no malicious behaviors, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation concerns. The existing report scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
