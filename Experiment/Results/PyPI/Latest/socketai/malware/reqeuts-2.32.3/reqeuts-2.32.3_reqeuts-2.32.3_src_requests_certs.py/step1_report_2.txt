{
  "purpose": "Provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by requests for SSL verification.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path, which could be used in further network requests or security checks.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function outputs the CA bundle path -> printed to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code simply imports a standard library function and prints its output. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints its value when run directly. It serves as a utility to display the default CA bundle path. The code is straightforward, with no external data inputs, no untrusted data flows, and no suspicious or malicious constructs. The comments clarify its purpose within the context of packaging or environment configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that reveals the location of the CA certificate bundle used by requests. No malicious intent or security risks are present. It is safe and typical for configuration or informational purposes.",
