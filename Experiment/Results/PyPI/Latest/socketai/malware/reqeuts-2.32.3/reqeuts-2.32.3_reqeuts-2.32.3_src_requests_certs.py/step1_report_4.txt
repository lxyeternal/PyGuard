{
  "purpose": "This script outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle provided by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location from the 'where' function imported from certifi.",
  "sinks": "The output of the script is printed to stdout; no other sink is present.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function provides the data source; the output is printed directly, representing a data flow from source to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'where' from 'certifi' and, if executed as the main program, prints the path to the CA bundle. There is no user input handling, no data manipulation beyond printing a static value. The code is straightforward and standard, with no signs of malicious intent. It appears to serve as a utility to display the CA bundle path for use in other contexts or packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions solely to display the location of the CA certificate bundle from certifi. There are no security risks or malware indicators.",
