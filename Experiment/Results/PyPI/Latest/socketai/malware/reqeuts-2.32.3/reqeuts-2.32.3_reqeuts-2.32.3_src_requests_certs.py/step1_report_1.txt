{
  "purpose": "This code retrieves and prints the default CA certificate bundle path provided by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package through the 'where' function import.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' line outputs the certificate bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'where' from certifi, then calls 'where()' and outputs the result. Data flows from the certifi package to the console output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses standard practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the certifi package, which provides the path to a trusted CA bundle. When run directly, it prints this path. The code is simple, with no external inputs or untrusted data sources, and no suspicious behaviors detected. Its purpose appears to be to display the default CA bundle location, useful for packaging or configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign function of printing the CA bundle path from certifi without any malicious intent or security issues. It is a standard, safe utility script.",
