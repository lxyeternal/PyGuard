{
  "purpose": "Provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used for SSL verification in requests.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from the 'certifi' package and printing its value.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' output could be used downstream in other scripts or processes, but no direct sink is present within this code.",
  "flows": "Import 'where' -> Call 'where()' -> Print the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code constructs. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard function from the certifi package, which provides the location of the trusted CA bundle. It then prints this location if run as a script. The code appears to be a simple utility for outputting the CA bundle path, with no input handling or external data sources. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The use of certifi is standard for SSL certificate validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that outputs the default CA bundle location used for SSL verification. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
