{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exceptions and warnings used by the Requests library for handling HTTP errors and related issues.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, imports, and class attributes. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling operations are present; the code does not process or transmit data beyond defining exceptions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from source to sink; the code only sets up exception classes and warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are observed. The code is straightforward, defining exceptions with no dynamic or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions, defines several custom exception classes related to HTTP errors and request issues, and declares warning classes. It uses inheritance appropriately, and there are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious constructs. The class hierarchies are standard, and no external data is processed or transmitted. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The structure appears typical for a Python exceptions module used in a larger library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception and warning class definitions for the Requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions solely to define exception handling structure without any external data handling or suspicious activities.",
