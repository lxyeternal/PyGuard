  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is purely class definitions for exceptions, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound; no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification for risk/malware scores?** Since no malicious activity or obfuscation is present, zero scores are justified.\n- **Overall assessment:** Completely benign, standard exception hierarchy.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Same as above, standard exception classes.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, minimal security risk.\n- **Overall assessment:** Safe, standard code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code defines exception classes with standard inheritance and no suspicious logic.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — slightly above zero, but given the context, this is acceptable as a minimal security risk due to potential attribute exposure.\n- **Justification for risk score?** The only slight concern is the storage of `response` and `request` objects, which could contain sensitive data. However, this is typical in error handling for HTTP libraries, not malicious.\n- **Overall assessment:** No malware or obfuscation; the minimal risk score is acceptable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Overall assessment:** Safe and straightforward.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Standard exception definitions, no malicious code.\n- **Overall assessment:** Clearly benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently show 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in one report (0.1), justified by the potential exposure of sensitive request/response objects, but this is standard practice and not malicious.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a typical exception class hierarchy for an HTTP request library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The minimal security risk score (0.1) in report 3 is justified but could be considered conservative; however, it remains acceptable given the context.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and standard for its purpose. It poses no security threat or malware risk.",
