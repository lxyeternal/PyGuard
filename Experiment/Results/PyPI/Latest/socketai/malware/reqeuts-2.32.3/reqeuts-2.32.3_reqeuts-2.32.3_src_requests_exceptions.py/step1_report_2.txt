  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the requests library to handle various HTTP and connection-related errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads and initializes exception classes, imports dependencies, and handles class inheritance.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform actions based on input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward class definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines exception classes for the requests library, inheriting from standard Python and third-party exception classes. It includes typical error handling constructs with no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No input handling, data leaks, or network activity is present. The code is clean, minimal, and serves a clear purpose related to error management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for handling HTTP and connection errors in a requests library context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and legitimate.",
