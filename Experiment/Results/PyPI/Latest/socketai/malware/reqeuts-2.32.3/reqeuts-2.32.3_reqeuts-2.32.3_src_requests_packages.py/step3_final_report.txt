  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by aliasing modules ('urllib3', 'idna', and optionally 'chardet') under the 'requests.packages' namespace to ensure legacy code functions correctly.",
  "sources": "Imports of 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet' modules; sys.modules dictionary for module aliasing.",
  "sinks": "sys.modules entries where modules are reassigned to 'requests.packages.*' namespace, potentially affecting module resolution.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are assigned to sys.modules entries under 'requests.packages.*', ensuring legacy code referencing these paths accesses the correct modules.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional manipulation of sys.modules to alias modules; no malicious code or obfuscation present; the pattern is unusual but known for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and reassigns sys.modules entries to alias these modules under a different namespace, primarily for backward compatibility. This involves iterating over sys.modules and updating entries to preserve module identities under 'requests.packages'. The pattern is unconventional but not malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The code's purpose is benign, and the manipulation could be exploited if the environment is compromised, but as-is, it is a known compatibility pattern. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the unusual but benign nature of the sys.modules manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility shim that manipulates sys.modules to support legacy module paths. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate given the pattern's potential for misuse in compromised environments, but in its current form, it is safe.",
