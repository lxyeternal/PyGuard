  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by aliasing certain packages and ensuring consistent package identities across sys.modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements and references to sys.modules, which may include dynamically imported modules and module attributes.",
  "sinks": "Modification of sys.modules entries to redirect package references, which could influence module loading behavior.",
  "flows": "Modules are imported and then sys.modules entries are altered to point to these modules under different names, potentially affecting package resolution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic sys.modules modifications for package aliasing is unusual and could be exploited if malicious modules are inserted into sys.modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific packages ('urllib3', 'idna') and then updates sys.modules entries to preserve package identities under different names, mainly for backward compatibility with requests. It also conditionally handles the 'chardet' package if present, updating sys.modules similarly. This pattern is a common technique to ensure compatibility across different package versions or environments, but it manipulates sys.modules in a way that could be exploited if malicious modules are present or injected into sys.modules. There are no direct network, file, or environment interactions that could be malicious, but the dynamic modification of sys.modules could be leveraged for malicious purposes if the environment is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "This code is primarily for maintaining compatibility and does not contain malicious intent on its face. However, the manipulation of sys.modules is unusual and potentially risky if used in a compromised environment. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful payloads.",
