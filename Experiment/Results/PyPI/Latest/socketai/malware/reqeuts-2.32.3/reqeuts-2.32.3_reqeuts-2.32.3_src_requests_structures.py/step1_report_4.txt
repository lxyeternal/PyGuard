{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and simple lookup dictionaries, used in request processing.",
  "sources": "None; the code mainly defines classes and their methods, no external input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is being written to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; classes are designed for internal data handling within requests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior detected. The code strictly implements data structures without any hidden or malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. Both are data structures without external input or output operations. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The classes serve standard purposes and do not perform any suspicious actions, code injection, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of case-insensitive and lookup dictionaries used in request processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be safe and straightforward.",
