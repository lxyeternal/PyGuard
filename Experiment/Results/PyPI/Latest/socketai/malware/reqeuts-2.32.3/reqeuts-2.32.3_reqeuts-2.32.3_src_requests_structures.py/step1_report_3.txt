  "purpose": "Define custom dictionary-like data structures for handling case-insensitive keys and lookup with potential special behaviors.",
  "sources": "Initialization of data structures, setting items, getting items, and representation methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential access to self.__dict__ for LookupDict, but only within class context; no external sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows mainly within class methods, no external data flows or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal __dict__ in LookupDict for data retrieval may lead to unexpected behavior if class is subclassed or manipulated, but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. CaseInsensitiveDict provides a case-insensitive dictionary interface, handling keys by lowercasing them internally while preserving original case for display. It implements all necessary methods for a dict-like object and includes a custom copy method. LookupDict is a simple dictionary wrapper that retrieves values from __dict__, which is standard practice. No external data sources, network communication, or suspicious operations are present. The code appears to be straightforward utility classes for managing dictionary data with specific behaviors. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or malware signatures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility classes for case-insensitive and lookup dictionary behavior with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It contains no external data leaks, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code.",
