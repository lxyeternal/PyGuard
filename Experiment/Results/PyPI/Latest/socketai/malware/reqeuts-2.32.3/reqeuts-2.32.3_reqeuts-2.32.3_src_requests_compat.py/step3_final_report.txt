  "purpose": "Compatibility support and utility functions for handling Python 2 and 3 differences, managing optional dependencies, and environment detection.",
  "sources": "Version detection from urllib3, importlib.import_module for optional dependencies (chardet/charset_normalizer), sys.version_info, import statements for standard libraries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks, network activity, or code execution.",
  "flows": "Version info and import attempts flow into conditional flags and dependency resolution; dynamic import of optional modules is handled safely with try-except.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.import_module for optional dependencies is standard; no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, manages optional dependencies via safe dynamic imports, and sets compatibility flags. It avoids untrusted data processing, network operations, or code injection. The dynamic import pattern is common and handled with try-except, reducing risk. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the code's benign and standard nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly assess its safety. The slight risk score in one report due to dynamic import is justified but could be considered negligible. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and aligns with best practices for such modules.",
