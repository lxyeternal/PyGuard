  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly assess its safety. The slight risk score in one report due to dynamic import is justified but could be considered negligible. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and aligns with best practices for such modules."
