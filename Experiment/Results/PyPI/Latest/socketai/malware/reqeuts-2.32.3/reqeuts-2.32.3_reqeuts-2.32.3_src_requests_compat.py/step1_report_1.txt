{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility support and utility functions for handling HTTP-related operations across different Python versions and environments.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from urllib3, sys, and import attempts for chardet/simplejson; imports standard libraries and attempts to import third-party libraries.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, no network, or file operations are present. No execution of untrusted input or data processing that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident; code mainly performs version checks, imports, and conditional assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or hardcoded secrets. The code is straightforward and standard for compatibility modules.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version detection, optional imports, and compatibility adjustments. It handles import errors gracefully, with no evidence of dynamic execution or malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages imports and environment checks typical for such support modules.",
