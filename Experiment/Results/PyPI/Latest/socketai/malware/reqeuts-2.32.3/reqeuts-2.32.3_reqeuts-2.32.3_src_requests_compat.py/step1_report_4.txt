  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and utility functions for handling HTTP requests, encoding, and character detection across different Python versions and libraries.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as importlib, sys, urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request, and built-in functions/variables.",
  "sinks": "Usage of importlib.import_module (dynamic import), import statements, and variable assignments from imported modules.",
  "flows": "Imports are performed at the start, and the dynamically imported chardet (or charset_normalizer) library is used in _resolve_char_detection(). No untrusted input flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code primarily handles compatibility and imports without performing any suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard import operations, version checks, and dynamic module resolution for character detection libraries. It defines compatibility flags for Python 2 and 3 and imports various modules safely. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors. The dynamic import of chardet/charset_normalizer is handled cautiously within a try-except block. No network activity or data exfiltration code is present. The code's structure and purpose align with maintaining compatibility across environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It focuses on importing and setting up utility functions securely. No malware or security threats are detected.",
