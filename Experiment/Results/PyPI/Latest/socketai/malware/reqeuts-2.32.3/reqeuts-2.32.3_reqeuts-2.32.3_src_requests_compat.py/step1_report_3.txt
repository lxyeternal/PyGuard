{
  "purpose": "This module handles import compatibility issues and utility functions for Python 2 and 3, as well as selecting appropriate libraries for character detection and JSON parsing.",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard libraries (importlib, sys, urllib3, collections, http, io, urllib), dynamic imports for chardet and simplejson, version info from sys, urllib3 version string.",
  "sinks": "Potential data processing via imported libraries, especially JSON parsing and character detection, but no direct sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from external inputs to sensitive sinks; mainly library imports and version checks without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code performs standard compatibility and utility functions. No obfuscated code or unusual logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs compatibility imports and environment detection, such as urllib3 version handling, character detection library resolution, and JSON library fallback. The import of external libraries is conditional and controlled, with no data processing or untrusted input handling. No potentially malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The code's structure and logic are straightforward, aligned with compatibility support. Overall, the code is benign with respect to security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility and utility module with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs standard import and version handling tasks without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
