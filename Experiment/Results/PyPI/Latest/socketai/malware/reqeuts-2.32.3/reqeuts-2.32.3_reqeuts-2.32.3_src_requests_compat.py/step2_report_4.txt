  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code with the descriptions, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies that the code handles compatibility, imports, and version detection. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no evidence of data flow, untrusted input processing, or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes compatibility, version detection, and safe imports. No malicious behavior or suspicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The code performs standard compatibility functions, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on compatibility, safe imports, and no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, with no network activity, data leaks, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Details standard import operations, dynamic module resolution, and compatibility flags. No malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior, just compatibility handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on dynamic imports via importlib, optional dependencies, and version detection. Notes potential risk in dynamic imports but considers it standard practice.\n- **Assessment:** Dynamic import of optional dependencies (chardet/charset_normalizer) is common and not malicious. No suspicious code or data flows.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.  \n- **Note:** The report assigns a small security risk (0.1) due to dynamic import patterns, which is a cautious stance but not indicative of actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking the code and reports:\n\n- **Presence of malicious activity:** None detected in any report or in the code. The code is a compatibility utility, with standard import patterns, version detection, and environment checks.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns are present.\n- **Malware:** No evidence of malware, such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0 or very close to 0 is appropriate. The slight risk assigned in report 5 is a cautious but perhaps overly conservative estimate, considering the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — the code is a standard compatibility module with no security risk.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nWhile dynamic imports can sometimes be a vector for malicious activity if the module names are manipulated, in this context, the module names are hardcoded strings and are standard for optional dependencies. No evidence suggests malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at zero, and the risk score at zero or negligible.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's purpose and the detailed analysis above.",
