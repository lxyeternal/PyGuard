{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as managing dependencies like urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, and json/simplejson.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version checks, and functions that load external libraries (importlib.import_module).",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe imports or dynamic module loading via importlib.import_module, which could be manipulated if the module name strings are tampered with.",
  "flows": "The code dynamically imports 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' based on the library's availability; imports json modules; detects Python version; assigns compatibility variables; and imports multiple standard library modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.import_module for optional dependencies. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs. The dynamic import is a typical pattern for optional dependencies, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages compatibility across Python versions and handles optional dependencies. It uses standard practices such as try-except for optional imports and dynamic imports via importlib. No suspicious code patterns, such as code injection or data exfiltration, are present. The dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' is standard for library compatibility, not malicious activity. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or behaviors indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility and dependency management module with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It adheres to standard practices for such modules. No malicious activity, backdoors, or data leakage points are evident.",
