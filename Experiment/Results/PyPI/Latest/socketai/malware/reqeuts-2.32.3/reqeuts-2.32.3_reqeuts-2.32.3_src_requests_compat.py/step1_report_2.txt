{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as resolving dependencies for character detection and JSON parsing.",
  "sources": "importlib (for dynamic module import), sys (for version info), urllib3 (version detection), module imports (_resolve_char_detection), standard library modules (collections, http, io, urllib), environment variables (via urllib functions).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted input is processed or forwarded to sensitive operations such as network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code primarily sets up compatibility and imports modules, without data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The code is straightforward and standard for compatibility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles compatibility between Python versions and manages imports for modules such as urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, and JSON. It uses dynamic imports and version detection to ensure the correct modules are used. No user input, network operations, or sensitive data handling occurs within this code. There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The overall structure and content are consistent with a standard compatibility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility layer without malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious or harmful operations. The likelihood of malicious behavior is negligible.",
