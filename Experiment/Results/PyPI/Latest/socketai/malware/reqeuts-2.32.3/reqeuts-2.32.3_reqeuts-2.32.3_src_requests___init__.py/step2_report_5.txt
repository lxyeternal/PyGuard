  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code sets up dependencies, performs version checks, and configures warnings for the 'requests' library. No suspicious behavior is noted.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard environment setup code. No malicious actions, data leaks, or obfuscation. Version assertions are typical but could be bypassed if assertions are disabled.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — reasonable. The low risk reflects environment validation, not active threats.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues. The report's reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar dependency validation and environment setup, with some reliance on assertions for version checks. Noted that assertions can be bypassed if Python runs with optimizations.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent; the code manages dependencies and attempts SSL fallback. Use of assertions is a potential concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — acceptable, given the environment validation context.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis is appropriate; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Dependency checks, SSL fallback, and warnings. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard setup code. Use of warnings and assertions is typical, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct assessment; no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Dependency validation, environment setup, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, performing environment checks and imports. No malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Dependency checks, SSL fallback, warning suppression, no data processing.\n- **Assessment:** Standard setup code. No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero, justified by dependency validation and environment configuration, which are common in library setup but do not pose security risks.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the dependency checks and environment setup, a slightly higher score (around 0.1–0.2) is justified but not higher, as these are standard practices.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThis code is standard setup code for the 'requests' library, with no malicious intent or security risks evident.",
