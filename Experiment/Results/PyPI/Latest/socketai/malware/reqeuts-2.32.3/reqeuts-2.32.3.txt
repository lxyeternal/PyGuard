The primary security consideration is safeguarding the version file from tampering. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical risks associated with executing external code and shell commands in setup scripts."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly assess its safety. The slight risk score in one report due to dynamic import is justified but could be considered negligible. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and aligns with best practices for such modules."

The low security risk score is appropriate given the pattern's potential for misuse in compromised environments, but in its current form, it is safe."
