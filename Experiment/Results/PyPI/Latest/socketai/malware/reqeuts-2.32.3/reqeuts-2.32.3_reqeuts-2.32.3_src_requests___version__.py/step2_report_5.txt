  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n- The code is a set of straightforward variable assignments defining package metadata for the 'requests' library.\n- It includes static strings for title, description, URL, version, author info, license, copyright.\n- The only non-standard element is a decorative ASCII art comment at the top, which is harmless.\n- There are no functions, no dynamic code, no input/output, no network calls, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious constructs.\n- The data is static and intended for documentation or package metadata purposes.\n\n**Assessment of Reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is metadata-only, with no dynamic behavior, no data flows, and no external interactions.\n- They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent, and contain no anomalies or obfuscation.\n- The confidence level is high (1) in all reports, which is appropriate given the simplicity and static nature of the code.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, which is justified.\n\n**Potential Issues or Inconsistencies:**\n- None of the reports suggest any suspicious activity or anomalies beyond standard package metadata.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and aligns with the code analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, and the reports are accurate.\n- No changes to scores or reasoning are necessary.\n- The decorative ASCII art does not impact security or obfuscation assessments.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0**\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, static metadata declaration for the 'requests' package, with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports correctly reflect this, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign scores independently, I would concur with the existing scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
