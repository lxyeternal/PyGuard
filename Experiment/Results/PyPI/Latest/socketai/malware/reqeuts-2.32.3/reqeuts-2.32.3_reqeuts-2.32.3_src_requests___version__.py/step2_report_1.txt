  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the code issues**: All reports describe the code as static metadata variable assignments for the 'requests' package. The original code confirms this—it's straightforward, with no dynamic code, input/output, or network interactions. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**: The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, consisting solely of static metadata variables, with no suspicious or malicious constructs.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n   \n   Since the code is purely static metadata, these scores are reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5**:\n   - No report assigns a risk higher than 0.5, which is correct. The code is benign.\n   \n5. **Malware score considerations**:\n   - All reports correctly assign malware score as 0, indicating no malicious behavior detected.\n   \n6. **Claims based on assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as harmless metadata declarations.\n\n7. **Score consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Summary and final assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, non-malicious metadata declaration.\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
