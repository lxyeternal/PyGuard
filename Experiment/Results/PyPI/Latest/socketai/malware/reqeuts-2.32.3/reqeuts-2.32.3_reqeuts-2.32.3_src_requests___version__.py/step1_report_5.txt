  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and other metadata.",
  "sources": "Constants and string assignments at the top of the module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no external data output or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; purely static metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; straightforward metadata definitions, no obfuscated code or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata variable assignments describing the package. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no malicious patterns detected. The content appears typical for a package's __init__.py or metadata file. No signs of malware or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard metadata declaration for the 'requests' package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is safe and typical for Python package modules.",
