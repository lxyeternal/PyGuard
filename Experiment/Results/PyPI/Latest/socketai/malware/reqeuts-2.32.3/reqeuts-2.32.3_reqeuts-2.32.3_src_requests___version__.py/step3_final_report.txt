  "sources": "Variable assignments defining package metadata (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__)",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, network calls, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static assignment without data flow or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative ASCII art comment; no suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with a decorative ASCII comment. No functions, input/output, network interactions, or dynamic code are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the straightforward, static content. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
