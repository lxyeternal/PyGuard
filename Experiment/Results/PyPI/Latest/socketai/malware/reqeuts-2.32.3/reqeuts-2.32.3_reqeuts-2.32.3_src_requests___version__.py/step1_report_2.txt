  "purpose": "Defines package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; this is only metadata declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only metadata variables with no suspicious or unusual values or code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright. There are no functions, input/output operations, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The content appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py or metadata declaration. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The ASCII art comment at the top is harmless and likely decorative.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata for the 'requests' package, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be a normal, benign header or metadata definition.",
