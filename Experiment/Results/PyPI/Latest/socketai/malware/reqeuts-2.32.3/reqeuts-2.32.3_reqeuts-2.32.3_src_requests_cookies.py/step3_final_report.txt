  "sources": "Cookie headers, request URL, response headers, cookie attributes.",
  "sinks": "Cookie header generation, cookie extraction into jar, cookie deletion.",
  "flows": "Request headers -> cookie jar extraction -> cookie storage -> request header creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard, well-documented utilities for handling cookies within the requests library. It includes classes for request and response mocking, cookie extraction, creation, and management with a dict-like interface. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious data flows. The functions operate solely on cookie data, with proper handling of cookie attributes and safe data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard utility code for cookie management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), consistent with its utility purpose.",
