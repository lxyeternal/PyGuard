{
  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to multiple external URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Constructed URLs with parameters sent via urllib.request.urlopen, transmitting data to external servers.",
  "flows": "System info sources feed into URL parameters, which are then transmitted to external domains via HTTP GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded external domains that appear suspicious; data exfiltration activity embedded in code without clear purpose; no user consent or security prompts. The URLs suggest tracking or malicious data collection. No obfuscation, but potential covert communication.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system-specific information such as hostname, username, current directory, and a random number, then constructs URLs to external servers. These URLs are used to send GET requests containing the collected data. The external URLs appear suspicious, potentially tracking or exfiltration endpoints. The code does not include any user notification, encryption, or data handling safeguards. It performs network communication with untrusted servers without validation, indicating malicious intent or at least suspicious activity. There are no obfuscation techniques or malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration. Overall, the code exhibits characteristics of malicious data collection, possibly used for tracking or espionage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is potentially malicious, designed to gather system info and transmit it covertly to external servers. It resembles behavior seen in malware or spyware modules due to data exfiltration to suspicious domains without user consent.",
