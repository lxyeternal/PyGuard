{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'tktoken', customizing the install process to execute a function from 'main' after installation.",
  "sources": "The script reads input from the 'setup.py' file itself and imports 'main' from a local module 'main' during installation.",
  "sinks": "The code executes 'main()' during the installation process, which could potentially run arbitrary code from 'main.py'.",
  "flows": "The install process triggers 'CrazyInstallStrat.run()', which calls 'main()' from the local module, executing whatever code is defined there.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' executes 'main()' unconditionally during installation, which is unusual and potentially risky. No other suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that runs 'main()' from a local module during installation. This behavior is atypical and may be used to execute malicious or undesired code upon package installation. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or external data sources are evident. The rest of the script appears standard, with dependency declarations and setup configurations. The key concern is the invocation of 'main()' during install, which could contain malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The script includes a potentially dangerous behavior by executing 'main()' during installation, which could run malicious code if 'main.py' contains harmful logic. This pattern is suspicious and warrants further review of 'main.py'.",
