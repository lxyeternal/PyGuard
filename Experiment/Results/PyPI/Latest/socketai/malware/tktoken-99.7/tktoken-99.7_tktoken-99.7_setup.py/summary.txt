  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing external code during installation poses a security risk, especially if main.py is untrusted. The reports' scores are appropriate, reflecting moderate concern. The primary issue is the potential for malicious code execution at install time, which warrants caution. No evidence of obfuscation or direct malicious activity is present, but the pattern itself is risky."
