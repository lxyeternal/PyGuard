  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'tktoken' Python package, including a custom installation step that executes code from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The custom install class calls the 'main' function from main.py during the install process.",
  "sinks": "Executing 'main()' could lead to execution of arbitrary code if main.py is malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "The install process flows from the 'run' method in CrazyInstallStrat to executing 'main()' from main.py after package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically executes a function from a local module ('main') during installation, which is unusual for setup scripts and can be exploited if 'main.py' is malicious. No other suspicious behaviors or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the 'run' method to invoke 'main()' from 'main.py' after standard installation steps. This behavior means code within 'main.py' is executed during package installation, which could be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The setup configuration itself appears standard, but the execution of 'main()' at install time is a potential security risk. The code does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity, but the dynamic execution is a notable anomaly and a possible attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes a potentially dangerous behavior by executing code from 'main.py' during installation. This could be exploited if the 'main.py' file is malicious or compromised. The rest of the code appears standard, but the dynamic invocation during install raises security concerns.",
