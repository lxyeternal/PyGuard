      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing external code during installation poses a security risk, especially if main.py is untrusted. The reports' scores are appropriate, reflecting moderate concern. The primary issue is the potential for malicious code execution at install time, which warrants caution. No evidence of obfuscation or direct malicious activity is present, but the pattern itself is risky."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior to suspicious domains, indicating malicious or spyware-like activity. The high scores in malware and security risk are justified. The activity warrants caution, further investigation, and potential mitigation. The code is not obfuscated but performs suspicious data transmission, justifying high suspicion and risk scores."
