{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration with a custom post-install script and console entry points for the 'zebo' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, and custom installation command; executes a subprocess call to run a function from 'zebo.scripts.runner'.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executes code that imports and runs 'i_am_cute' from 'zebo.scripts.runner'.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method triggers a subprocess that executes 'i_am_cute()' from 'zebo.scripts.runner', which could perform arbitrary actions.",
  "anomalies": "The post-install script executes code from a module ('zebo.scripts.runner') during installation without clear visibility into what 'i_am_cute()' does. The code imports and runs a potentially unknown function at install time, which could be malicious or unwanted.",
  "analysis": "The setup script is typical for a Python package, but the key concern is the CustomInstallCommand's run method, which executes 'i_am_cute()' from 'zebo.scripts.runner' after installation via a subprocess call. The use of 'sys.executable' with a dynamic import and function call can be used for malicious activities if 'i_am_cute()' contains malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation. The package also defines console scripts, which could be used to invoke malicious code if 'zebo.scripts.runner' is compromised. There are no apparent obfuscated code or hard-coded secrets. However, the execution of an arbitrary function during install without transparency or validation is suspicious and can be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes a post-install script that runs code from 'zebo.scripts.runner' without validation, which could be malicious depending on the implementation of 'i_am_cute()'. While the code itself appears typical for a setup script, the dynamic execution during install poses a security risk if the function performs malicious actions. Further inspection of 'zebo.scripts.runner' is recommended before use.",
