{
  "purpose": "The code executes a function 'i_am_cute' from 'zebo.scripts.runner' during installation via a subprocess call, which could be malicious or maliciously exploited.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call executing 'from zebo.scripts.runner import i_am_cute; i_am_cute()' during the custom install command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess executes code that could perform malicious actions, such as system modification, data exfiltration, or backdoor access, depending on 'i_am_cute's implementation.",
  "flows": "The source is the subprocess call during installation; the sink is the execution of 'i_am_cute()' which could perform harmful operations on the system.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of arbitrary code during setup without validation, dynamic import and execution of internal functions, and running code via subprocess during install are suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that runs a subprocess executing 'from zebo.scripts.runner import i_am_cute; i_am_cute()'. This pattern is inherently risky because it executes code during package installation without validation. The function 'i_am_cute' is imported from within the package, but its implementation is unknown, leaving potential for malicious behavior. The code is not obfuscated, and no hardcoded secrets are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.2-0.4, security risk 0.4-0.7) are conservative; given the pattern, a higher malware score (around 0.5) and risk score (around 0.7) are justified. The execution during install can be exploited for malicious purposes such as data theft, backdoors, or system compromise. Without inspecting 'i_am_cute', the exact maliciousness cannot be confirmed, but the pattern itself warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'i_am_cute()' during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially if the function contains harmful code. The current scores should be adjusted upward to reflect the inherent risk of executing untrusted code during setup. A malware score of approximately 0.6 and a security risk score of 0.7 are appropriate, and further review of 'i_am_cute()' is strongly recommended before trusting or deploying this package.",
