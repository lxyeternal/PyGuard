{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'zebo' Python package, including a custom post-install script execution.",
  "sources": "Reading package data, importing modules, subprocess call in the custom install command, setup parameters, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.check_call potentially executes arbitrary code during installation.",
  "flows": "The custom install command runs a Python code snippet via subprocess, which imports and executes a function from zebo.scripts.runner.",
  "anomalies": "The use of subprocess to run a Python command that executes a function from a package module during installation could be a suspicious post-install action, depending on what 'i_am_cute()' does. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code directly visible, but the post-install script is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation class that executes a Python function 'i_am_cute' from 'zebo.scripts.runner' upon installation, via a subprocess call. The package includes entry points for command-line scripts. The use of subprocess to run code during install is uncommon and could be exploited to execute malicious code if 'i_am_cute' performs harmful actions. No other malicious or obfuscated code detected. The code appears to be designed to execute code during setup, which is a potential security concern depending on the behavior of 'i_am_cute'.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains a post-install hook that executes a function from the package, which could be malicious if the function performs harmful actions. The code itself is not obfuscated and does not contain clear malicious payloads, but the execution during install is suspicious and warrants further review of 'i_am_cute'.",
