  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'i_am_cute()' during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially if the function contains harmful code. The current scores should be adjusted upward to reflect the inherent risk of executing untrusted code during setup. A malware score of approximately 0.6 and a security risk score of 0.7 are appropriate, and further review of 'i_am_cute()' is strongly recommended before trusting or deploying this package."
