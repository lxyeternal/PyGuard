  "purpose": "Static import statements from local modules, likely for package initialization or modular code organization.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .hello and .scripts modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; code only imports modules.",
  "flows": "No data flow or runtime behavior; static imports do not involve data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with no data processing, network activity, or executable logic. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns support these conclusions. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident, and the code aligns with standard Python practices for module imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
