{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import functions or modules 'hello' and 'runner' from sibling modules within the same package, likely for use in the package's functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads from internal module imports (.hello, .scripts), which are part of the package's own structure.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet, as there are no operations involving untrusted input, network, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only contains import statements and no data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements that bring in components from sibling modules within the same package. These are standard Python import statements with relative paths. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscated code. Since no executable logic is present beyond imports, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module import statement with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as part of a larger package structure and does not contain any suspicious activity.",
