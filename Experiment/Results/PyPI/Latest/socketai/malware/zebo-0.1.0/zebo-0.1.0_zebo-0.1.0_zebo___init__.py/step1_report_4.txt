{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be importing modules or functions named 'hello' and 'runner' from local package submodules.",
  "sources": "The imports are the only source points, reading code definitions from local files ('hello' and 'scripts') within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; no untrusted data handling, external network communication, or file operations are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data from sources to sinks are observable within this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs, are evident in these import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement of local modules or functions. It does not perform any actions, data processing, or network communication. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The minimal structure suggests this is a typical module import pattern in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard package setup code.",
