  "purpose": "This code appears to import functions or modules from local files within the package, likely for execution or further use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .hello and .scripts",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external network communication observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs static imports without data flow logic",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code, no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules from the current package directory, 'hello' and 'scripts'. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other operations. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python packages. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement used to include local modules. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies within this snippet.",
