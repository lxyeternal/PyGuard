  "purpose": "This code imports modules 'hello' and 'runner' from relative packages, likely for use within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Module imports from relative paths within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible from import statements alone; these are static import statements without runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no apparent unusual behavior or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements from relative modules. It does not perform any data processing, input reading, or output. Since it is a simple module import, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. It lacks any suspicious code structures, external network calls, or handling of sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to be a benign, standard module import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
