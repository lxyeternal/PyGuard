  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of import statements from local modules (`.hello` and `.scripts`).\n   - There is no data processing, network communication, or any runtime behavior beyond static imports.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code is minimal and typical for Python packages, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning; the code is straightforward.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the code snippet and analysis.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely import statements with no malicious behavior, the `malware` score should remain 0.\n   - The `securityRisk` score is also appropriately 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities & Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they recognize that import statements alone do not imply malicious intent.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities that are based on assumptions.\n\n6. **Consistency & Recommendations:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - Given the evidence, no changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThis code snippet is benign, consisting solely of standard local module import statements. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Work out the combined scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**This aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports provided.**",
