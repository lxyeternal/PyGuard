{
  "purpose": "Import a symbol named 'i_am_cute' from the local 'runner' module, likely for use within the larger project.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports a symbol without executing further logic.",
  "anomalies": "The symbol name 'i_am_cute' is non-standard and whimsical, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement, with no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The unusual naming could be playful or a placeholder but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (0.1), reflecting minor concern solely due to the non-standard name. Confidence in benign assessment is high (0.8), given the simplicity of the code and lack of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, representing a simple import with an unusual but harmless symbol name. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risk. The scores should reflect this, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low risk score of 0.1.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
