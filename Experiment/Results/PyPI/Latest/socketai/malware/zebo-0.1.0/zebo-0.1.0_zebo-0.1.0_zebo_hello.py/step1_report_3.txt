{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function 'hello' that calls 'i_am_cute' from an imported module and prints a greeting message.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from zebo.scripts.runner import i_am_cute' and the 'print' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' function is a sink that outputs to the console; 'i_am_cute' may also be a sink depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Code flows from import statement to function call 'i_am_cute', then to the print statement when 'hello()' is invoked.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'i_am_cute' is imported from an external module; without its implementation, potential malicious behavior cannot be ruled out. No other anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'i_am_cute' from a module within 'zebo.scripts.runner'. The 'hello' function calls this imported function and then prints a message. The security concern hinges on what 'i_am_cute' does. If 'i_am_cute' contains malicious code or performs unauthorized actions, it could pose a risk. However, based solely on this snippet, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The code structure is straightforward and lacks obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign at face value; the main concern is the behavior of 'i_am_cute' in the external module, which cannot be assessed here. No malicious intent or malicious code is directly observable in this snippet.",
