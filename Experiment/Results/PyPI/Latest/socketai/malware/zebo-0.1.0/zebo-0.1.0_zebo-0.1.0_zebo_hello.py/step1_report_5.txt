{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that calls another function imported from an external module and prints a greeting message.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'zebo.scripts.runner' and the call to 'i_am_cute()' within the 'hello()' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'i_am_cute()' function could potentially be a sink if it executes malicious code or performs malicious actions; the 'print' statement is a benign output.",
  "flows": "Import 'i_am_cute' -> Call 'i_am_cute()' within 'hello()' -> Print greeting message.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'i_am_cute()' is imported from a non-standard module path; without inspecting its implementation, its behavior cannot be confirmed. No other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from an external module and calls it within a function. The import path suggests a custom or third-party module, but there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs in this snippet. The function 'i_am_cute()' could potentially perform any action, but based on this code alone, its behavior is unknown. The printed message is harmless. Without inspecting 'i_am_cute()', the overall risk cannot be definitively determined.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears benign, but the imported function 'i_am_cute()' from 'zebo.scripts.runner' could be a vector for malicious activity if it is malicious. Given only this snippet, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but reliance on external code warrants caution.",
