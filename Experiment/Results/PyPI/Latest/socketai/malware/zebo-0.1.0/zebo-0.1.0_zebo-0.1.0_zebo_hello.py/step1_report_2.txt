{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function 'hello' that calls 'i_am_cute' from an external module and prints a greeting message.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'zebo.scripts.runner' and the 'print' function",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statement is benign; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The imported function 'i_am_cute' is called within 'hello', but without details about its implementation, potential data flows are uncertain.",
  "anomalies": "The imported function 'i_am_cute' is from an external module, which could potentially contain malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this fragment alone. No suspicious code, obfuscated constructs, or hardcoded secrets are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a potentially external module and calls it within the 'hello' function, then prints a greeting. There are no apparent security issues within this snippet itself. However, reliance on an external function 'i_am_cute' introduces risk if the imported module contains malicious code, but this cannot be assessed without further inspection of 'zebo.scripts.runner'. The code structure is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears benign within this fragment, with no direct malicious activity evident. The main concern relates to the imported function, which is outside the scope of this snippet. Overall, no malicious behavior is detectable here.",
