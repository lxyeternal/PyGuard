{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'i_am_cute' from an external module and calls it within a function, then prints a message.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'zebo.scripts.runner', invocation of 'i_am_cute()' within 'hello()'",
  "sinks": "The call to 'i_am_cute()' could lead to execution of external or malicious code if the imported function is harmful",
  "flows": "Import 'i_am_cute' -> call 'i_am_cute()' within 'hello()' -> print message",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import path 'zebo.scripts.runner', no implementation details of 'i_am_cute' provided, reliance on external code",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and syntactically correct, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs. The primary concern is the external dependency 'zebo.scripts.runner' and its 'i_am_cute' function, which could contain malicious behavior. The code itself does not perform any malicious actions. All reports correctly identify the external dependency as the main risk factor, assigning a malware score of 0 and low security risk scores (~0.2-0.3). The confidence in these assessments is moderate, given the lack of insight into the external module. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no evidence suggests malicious intent within this code fragment. Further inspection of the external module is recommended to confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious activity evident. The main risk stems from the external module 'zebo.scripts.runner'. The current scores and assessments are appropriate; the overall security posture is low risk, pending further review of the external dependency.",
