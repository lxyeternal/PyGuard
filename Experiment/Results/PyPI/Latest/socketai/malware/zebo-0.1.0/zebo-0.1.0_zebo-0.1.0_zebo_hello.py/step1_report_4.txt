{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function 'hello' that calls an imported function 'i_am_cute' from a module 'zebo.scripts.runner' and then prints a message.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported function 'i_am_cute' from 'zebo.scripts.runner'. It does not read any user input or external data directly.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'i_am_cute()', which may be a sink if 'i_am_cute()' performs malicious actions, but without its implementation, this is unknown. The print statement is benign.",
  "flows": "Imported function 'i_am_cute' is invoked when 'hello()' is called, then a print statement executes. The flow depends on the behavior of 'i_am_cute()'.",
  "anomalies": "The import path 'zebo.scripts.runner' is unusual and may suggest obfuscation or hidden functionality, but this alone is not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a potentially custom or obscure module and executing a function from it. Without the implementation details of 'i_am_cute()', it's impossible to determine if malicious behavior exists. The structure is straightforward and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious patterns. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are used. The import path may warrant further investigation, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The only potential concern is the source of 'i_am_cute()', which could be benign or malicious depending on its implementation. Further review of the 'zebo.scripts.runner' module is recommended, but the code snippet itself appears benign.",
