  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward: importing 'i_am_cute' from 'zebo.scripts.runner', calling it within 'hello()', and printing a message.\n- No direct malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are visible.\n- The primary concern is the external module 'zebo.scripts.runner' and the behavior of 'i_am_cute()', which cannot be assessed from this fragment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code as provided is syntactically correct and does not contain errors.\n- **Malicious activity:** Not evident in this fragment; the concern hinges on the imported function.\n\n### Flaws or logical issues:\n- No logical flaws are apparent in the code snippet itself.\n- The reports correctly identify that the main risk is external.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Range from 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting some caution due to external dependency.\n\n### Justification of risk scores:\n- The risk scores are reasonable given the external dependency. The code is benign, but reliance on an external module that could be malicious warrants some caution, hence scores around 0.2-0.3.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports do not challenge the assumption that 'i_am_cute' could be malicious; they acknowledge this risk but cannot confirm it.\n- No reports suggest that the imported module or function is obfuscated or malicious, so scores should remain low.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (moderate caution due to external dependency)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code appears benign; the primary concern is the external module 'zebo.scripts.runner' and its 'i_am_cute' function. Without inspecting that module, the risk remains speculative but should be acknowledged.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Overall, the code is safe as presented, but external dependencies should be audited to confirm their safety.**",
