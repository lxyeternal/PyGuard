{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information such as public IP, hostname, home directory, and current directory, then transmits this data immediately upon import to an internal IP address, and finally sets up a Python package named 'pxz'.",
  "sources": "os.popen('curl -s ifconfig.me'), os.uname()[1], os.path.expanduser('~'), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to 'http://10.0.2.15:8080' with system info as URL parameters",
  "flows": "Source data (public IP, hostname, directories) -> requests.get() call to internal IP",
  "anomalies": "Immediate execution of data collection upon import, use of os.popen with curl, transmission of sensitive info without user consent, sending data over GET request to internal IP",
  "analysis": "The code performs system info collection and exfiltration immediately upon import, which is suspicious and indicative of covert data gathering. It uses less safe methods like os.popen with curl instead of Python-native functions. The data is sent via a GET request to an internal IP, which could be benign (testing) or malicious (privacy invasion). No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. The activity aligns with privacy-invasive behavior and potential covert exfiltration but lacks active malicious code or payloads. The scores in the reports generally reflect suspicion of privacy violation but vary in severity. Given the absence of active malware or obfuscation, the malware score should be moderate, around 0.3-0.4, with a high security risk (~0.7) due to privacy concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data collection and transmission behavior that is suspicious and potentially malicious in the context of supply chain security. While it does not contain active malware payloads or obfuscation, its privacy-invasive actions justify a high security risk score. The malware score should be moderate, reflecting suspicion but not definitive malicious payloads. Overall, the behavior warrants caution and further investigation, especially considering the immediate execution and data exfiltration to an internal IP.",
