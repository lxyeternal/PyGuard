{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'pxz' and includes a function to collect and send system information to a specified server.",
  "sources": "Reading system info via os.popen, os.uname(), os.path.expanduser(), os.getcwd(), and network request to 'http://10.0.2.15:8080' using requests.get()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call that transmits system data (public IP, hostname, directories) to an external IP address",
  "flows": "System info gathered from OS functions flows directly into URL parameters of the GET request, which is sent to an internal IP address",
  "anomalies": "The code collects system info and immediately sends it to an internal server without user consent or clear purpose. The use of curl via os.popen and data exfiltration indicates suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script combines a standard package setup with an embedded function that gathers sensitive system data such as public IP, hostname, home directory, and current directory. It then transmits this data to a private IP address via an HTTP GET request. The data collection occurs unconditionally upon import, with no validation, user notification, or explicit intent. While the setup() function appears benign, the embedded data exfiltration behavior is suspicious, especially given the lack of transparency and the use of an internal IP address for data transmission. The code does not perform malicious actions like modifying files or executing harmful commands but covertly gathers and transmits system info, which could be used for tracking or malicious surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "The code embeds a potentially malicious behavior by collecting and transmitting system information to an internal IP address without user consent. While the setup function itself is standard, the hidden data exfiltration makes this suspicious. The overall security risk is moderate, with a possibility of malicious intent due to covert data collection.",
