      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data collection and transmission behavior that is suspicious and potentially malicious in the context of supply chain security. While it does not contain active malware payloads or obfuscation, its privacy-invasive actions justify a high security risk score. The malware score should be moderate, reflecting suspicion but not definitive malicious payloads. Overall, the behavior warrants caution and further investigation, especially considering the immediate execution and data exfiltration to an internal IP."

The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and low security risk scores reflecting minor potential concerns due to subprocess and dynamic features. No adjustments are necessary."
