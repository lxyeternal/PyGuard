{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from environment variables, file input, and potentially external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted data is written to files or transmitted over network connections within the code.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or input sources flows into processing functions, possibly reaching output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies; code structure is standard, but there are some unusual import patterns and possible dynamic code execution segments. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries and appears to perform typical data processing tasks. There are no signs of malicious activities such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. Import statements and function calls are consistent with legitimate usage. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns detected. Without external context or runtime behavior, no malicious intent is apparent. However, some dynamic import or execution patterns warrant further review if present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on static analysis, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment. It seems to be a benign utility or application code, but confidence is moderate due to limited context.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
