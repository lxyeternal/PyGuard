{
  "purpose": "The code outputs a static message 'hello' with no input handling, external data, or complex logic, indicating benign behavior.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static code with no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic print statement with no inputs, external interactions, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify the scores. The assessments are consistent and accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
