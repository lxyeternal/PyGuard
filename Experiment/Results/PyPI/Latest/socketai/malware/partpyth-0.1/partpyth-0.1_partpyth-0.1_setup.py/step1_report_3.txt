{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that downloads and executes an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a URL ('https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe') during the subprocess.run call in the custom install command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file using PowerShell's Start-Process, which can lead to running potentially malicious code if the file is harmful.",
  "flows": "Download command (source) -> file saved to disk -> open command (to execute the file) -> code execution (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes automatically downloading and executing an external executable during package installation without user consent, which is highly suspicious. Use of PowerShell commands in this context, especially with external URLs, indicates malicious intent. No validation of the download is performed, and the code does not verify the integrity or authenticity of the file.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard installation procedure by defining a custom command. It constructs a PowerShell command to download an executable file from a remote URL and saves it locally. If the download succeeds, it automatically opens (executes) the file, which could be malicious. This behavior is consistent with deploying malware or malicious payloads through a package installer. The approach circumvents typical security controls by embedding the download and execution within the setup script. The rest of the setup code appears normal, with no other suspicious activity. Overall, the code facilitates the download and execution of potentially malicious content during installation.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. It demonstrates a supply chain attack vector designed to run arbitrary code on systems where the package is installed.",
