{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process to download and execute an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current working directory, and the URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe' for downloading the file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via PowerShell's Start-Process, which can run arbitrary code on the system.",
  "flows": "Download URL (source) -> Save to local file -> Execute the file (sink) using PowerShell command.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from an external source and executes it silently during package installation, which is highly unusual and suspicious behavior. No validation or checks are performed on the downloaded file. The download and execution happen automatically during install, which could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the 'install' command to download an executable from a remote URL using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest. Upon successful download, it proceeds to run the executable via PowerShell's Start-Process. This behavior indicates potential malicious intent, as executing external code during package installation can compromise the user's system. The code does not verify the authenticity, integrity, or safety of the downloaded file. The use of PowerShell commands for download and execution, especially from a seemingly unrelated URL, is a significant security concern. No other dependencies or code logic mitigate this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation, representing a high security risk. It is strongly advised to avoid using this package or to review the source for further malicious activity.",
