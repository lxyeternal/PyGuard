{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes an external executable during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads external data from a URL via PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest, specifically downloading 'CBLines.exe'.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded executable is opened with Start-Process, potentially executing malicious code without user consent.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the URL (source) to a file on disk, then from the file to execution via Start-Process (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and directly executes an external binary during package installation, which is highly unusual and suspicious. No checks are performed on the executable's integrity or origin. The use of PowerShell commands to silently download and execute files indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard installation process to download an executable from a remote URL, then executes it immediately. This behavior could allow remote command and control or malicious payload deployment. There are no safeguards, signature verifications, or user prompts. The use of subprocess with shell=True and direct execution of potentially untrusted code strongly indicates malicious behavior. The code does not perform any validation or sandboxing, making it a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious intent by downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation without user consent or verification. This behavior is indicative of malware and represents a high security threat.",
