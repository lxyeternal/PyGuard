  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes a remote executable during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a remote URL via PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest and executes the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded executable via PowerShell Start-Process; the file is opened/executed directly on the system.",
  "flows": "Download URL (remote source) -> Save to local file -> Execute/open the file via PowerShell command.",
  "anomalies": "Download and execution of a remote executable during package installation is highly suspicious and atypical for legitimate setup scripts. The use of PowerShell commands to download and run external code is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard install command in setuptools. During installation, it constructs PowerShell commands to download an executable from a specific URL and then immediately attempts to run that executable. This behavior is not typical for a setup script and suggests an intent to execute arbitrary code on the target system. The file 'CBLines.exe' is fetched from an external source, which could be malicious. The script then proceeds with the normal installation process after executing the downloaded file. This pattern indicates malicious behavior, such as remote code execution, and potentially installing malware or backdoors. The code's structure and behavior raise significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation. This is a supply chain attack vector or malicious backdoor, and it is highly suspicious and dangerous. The package should not be trusted or used.",
