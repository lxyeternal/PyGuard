{
  "purpose": "The code overrides the standard installation process to download and execute an external executable from a remote URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the internet via PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest command and accesses the current working directory for saving the file.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the downloaded file using PowerShell's Start-Process, which can lead to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Input source: remote URL via Invoke-WebRequest -> saved to local path -> executed via Start-Process.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional download and execution of an external executable during setup without validation, signature check, or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to run a PowerShell command that downloads an executable from a remote URL and then immediately executes it. No validation or safety checks are performed. The behavior is suspicious and typical of malicious supply chain attacks. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but performs potentially dangerous actions during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code actively downloads and executes external code during installation without validation, indicating malicious intent. It constitutes a high security risk and a supply chain attack vector. The malware score should be set to 1, the security risk to 1, and obfuscation remains 0.",
