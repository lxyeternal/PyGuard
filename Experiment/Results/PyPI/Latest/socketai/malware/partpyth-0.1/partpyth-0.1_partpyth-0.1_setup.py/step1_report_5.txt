{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to download and execute an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the internet via PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest command, and reads/writes files on the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "The code executes downloaded files using PowerShell Start-Process, potentially running malicious code without user consent.",
  "flows": "Download URL (source) → Save to disk → Open/execute file (sink) through Start-Process",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes downloading and executing an external executable during package installation, which is atypical for standard Python setup scripts; hardcoded URL and automatic execution are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the default install command to perform an additional download of an executable file from a remote URL using PowerShell. If the download is successful, it proceeds to open and run the downloaded file with no user interaction or warning. This behavior can be malicious, especially if the executable performs harmful actions or is from an untrusted source. The use of subprocess to invoke PowerShell commands to download and execute code during package setup is highly unusual and risky. No other dependencies or safeguards are present to validate or sandbox this behavior. The code demonstrates clear intent to run remote code on the user's machine during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent by downloading and executing an external executable during installation, which can compromise user systems. It leverages standard setup tooling to perform potentially harmful actions, constituting a security risk.",
