  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple external URLs for reporting or tracking purposes.",
  "sources": "platform.node() for hostname, getpass.getuser() for username, os.getcwd() for current directory, random.randint() for a random number",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send HTTP GET requests with collected data to external URLs",
  "flows": "System info collected from sources -> URL parameters constructed -> URL request sent to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Usage of multiple suspicious external domains, sending system information without user consent, no apparent user interaction or consent mechanism",
  "analysis": "The script gathers basic system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and a random number. It then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends GET requests to three external domains that are potentially malicious or suspicious. The domains resemble command-and-control or tracking domains, raising concerns about potential data exfiltration or malicious tracking. The code does not handle responses beyond logging, but it actively contacts external servers with system data, which is suspicious behavior, especially without any user notification or consent. The code’s structure and straightforward data collection and transmission suggest possible malicious intent or at least undesirable tracking behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and transmits it to suspicious external servers without user consent, indicating potentially malicious or tracking behavior. It does not contain obfuscation or malware payloads but exhibits privacy-invasive actions with high suspicion.",
