  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory) flows from sources to URL parameters, then sent over the network via urlopen()",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domains, dynamic URL generation with a random number, no user consent prompts, potential tracking activity",
  "analysis": "The code gathers basic system details (hostname, username, current directory) and constructs URLs with these details along with a random number. It then attempts to access these URLs, which suggests data exfiltration or tracking. The domains used are suspicious and not standard for legitimate purposes. There is no explicit malicious payload, but the pattern of data collection and external communication points to potential privacy invasion or tracking. No obfuscation or malicious code injection is present, but the network activity to unknown domains is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to collect and send system information to suspicious external servers, indicating possible malicious intent such as tracking or data exfiltration. While no explicit malware or malicious payload is found, the behavior warrants caution due to external communication to untrusted domains.",
