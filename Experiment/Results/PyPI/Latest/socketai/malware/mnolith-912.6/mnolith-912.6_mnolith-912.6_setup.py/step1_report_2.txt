{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration and execute a custom install step that runs a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The import of 'main' module within the run() method of the CrazyInstallStrat class.",
  "sinks": "The call to main() from main.py, which could potentially execute arbitrary code during installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run() method imports main and executes main(), creating a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes code from main.py during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious if main.py contains harmful code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation command CrazyInstallStrat that, after running the standard install process, imports and executes the main() function from main.py. This behavior could be used to run malicious code during installation, such as installing backdoors, malware, or executing unwanted actions. The rest of the setup code appears standard, but the post-installation code execution is suspicious because it runs arbitrary code from an external module at install time. No other malicious or suspicious activity is evident. This pattern is often associated with supply chain attacks or malicious package behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The package runs arbitrary code from main.py during installation, which poses a significant security risk. This behavior is suspicious and could be used to execute malicious code, making this package potentially harmful if the main.py contains malicious content.",
