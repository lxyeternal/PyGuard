{
  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'textgradient' for distribution, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "None specific to input data; the code reads static package configuration data and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or sensitive information handling detected.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures detected. The package data, author info, and dependencies appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses setuptools to configure packaging parameters. It specifies package name, version, dependencies ('colorama'), entry points for console scripts, package data including a config file, and metadata such as author info and URL. All elements are typical for a Python package distribution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues. The code solely handles package configuration without executing external data or system commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
