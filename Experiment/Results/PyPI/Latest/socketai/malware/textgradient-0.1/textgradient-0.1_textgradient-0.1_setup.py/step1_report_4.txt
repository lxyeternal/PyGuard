  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'textgradient', specifying its metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads package data, dependencies, and metadata from predefined parameters and files within the project.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; the script primarily performs static configuration for packaging.",
  "flows": "The configuration parameters flow from the setup() function into the package build process, with no dynamic or external data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The email address is publicly visible but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script utilizing setuptools for packaging a Python project. It specifies dependencies, entry points for CLI commands, package data, and metadata. All components follow common practices without signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious data handling. No external inputs or dynamic code execution are evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It securely and transparently defines the package parameters.",
