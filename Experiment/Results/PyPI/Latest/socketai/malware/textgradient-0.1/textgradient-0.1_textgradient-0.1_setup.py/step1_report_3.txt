{
  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for the 'textgradient' Python package, including dependencies, entry points, and metadata.",
  "sources": "N/A (setup script primarily defines package metadata and configuration; no input sources or data reading mechanisms present).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from sources to sinks; the script is purely declarative for packaging purposes).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows standard Python packaging conventions without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools functions to configure package distribution. It specifies package name, version, dependencies, entry points, package data, and metadata such as author and URL. There are no input reading, data processing, or code execution beyond package setup. All elements appear standard for Python package configuration. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets (besides a plain email), or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging the 'textgradient' library. It contains no malicious intent, suspicious code, or security risks. It is safe to use as a package configuration file.",
