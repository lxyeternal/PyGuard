  "sources": "No external data sources; static setup.py fields.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or code execution within this script.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setuptools setup script, with no dynamic code, input handling, or obfuscation. The entry point references a function that executes during runtime, but this is outside the scope of setup.py. No malicious behavior, code injection, or security flaws are present in this configuration. The scores assigned in the critical reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The slight caution regarding the entry point is justified but does not reflect malicious intent within setup.py itself.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to the runtime code invoked by the entry point, which is outside this script. All reports are accurate; no adjustments needed.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
