{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'textgradient' including dependencies, entry points, and package data.",
  "sources": "Code reads package metadata (name, version, author info), package dependencies (install_requires), entry point script (textgradient.textgradient:main), and package data (config.json).",
  "sinks": "Execution of the entry point script 'textgradient=textgradient.gradient:main' could execute arbitrary code defined in the script, but no malicious activity is evident from setup.py alone.",
  "flows": "Installation dependencies and package data are set during package install; the entry point 'textgradient' triggers execution of 'textgradient.gradient:main', which is outside this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code are present. The code is standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "This code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and package data. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detectable within this setup script itself. The presence of an email address and GitHub URL are typical and do not indicate malicious intent. The entry point references an external function that could be reviewed separately, but from this code alone, there are no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package setup script without malicious intent or security issues. It simply configures the package installation process with no suspicious behavior detected.",
