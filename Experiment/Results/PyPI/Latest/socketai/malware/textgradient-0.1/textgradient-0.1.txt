The security risk is minimal, primarily related to the runtime code invoked by the entry point, which is outside this script. All reports are accurate; no adjustments needed."

      "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but insecure due to the use of exec() on external input, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if 'config.json' is maliciously altered. The primary security risk is supply chain attack potential. No malware or obfuscation is present in the code. The risk score should be high, around 0.85, consistent with the vulnerability of executing unvalidated external code."
