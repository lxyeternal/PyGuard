{
  "purpose": "The code reads configuration data from a JSON file to retrieve a startup code snippet, then executes that code dynamically.",
  "sources": "The code reads from 'config.json' file when the load_config() function is called.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the code obtained from the configuration file, which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "load_config() reads data from 'config.json' -> exec(code) executes the untrusted code from the config.",
  "anomalies": "The use of exec() on dynamically loaded configuration data is inherently risky; no validation or sanitization of the code is performed. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors are evident. The code relies entirely on external input without verification.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes color formatting tools, defines functions for color gradient manipulation, and loads a configuration file named 'config.json'. If the file is missing, it defaults to printing a message. The main function executes code obtained from the config file without any validation or restrictions. The critical security concern is the use of exec() on data that can be modified externally, allowing potential execution of malicious code embedded in the configuration. No obfuscation or malware-specific code is present; however, the design pattern is risky and could lead to arbitrary code execution if the config file is tampered with.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a significant security risk due to the use of exec() on externally loaded data without validation. It could execute malicious code if the configuration file is compromised. While no malicious intent is explicitly coded, the design is unsafe and vulnerable to supply chain attacks.",
