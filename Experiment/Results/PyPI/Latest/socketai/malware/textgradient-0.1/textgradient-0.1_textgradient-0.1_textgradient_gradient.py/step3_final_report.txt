{
  "purpose": "The code loads a configuration file 'config.json' to retrieve a 'startup_code' string and executes it via exec(), which introduces a significant security risk if the file is tampered with. The primary purpose appears to be aesthetic terminal text coloring with gradient effects.",
  "sources": "Reading 'config.json' file and loading 'startup_code' string",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing the loaded 'startup_code' from the configuration file",
  "flows": "load_config() reads 'config.json' -> returns 'startup_code' -> main() executes exec(code)",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on external, unvalidated input; no validation or sanitization of 'startup_code'",
  "analysis": "The script provides functions for color gradient text output and loads a 'startup_code' string from 'config.json'. It then executes this code with exec(), which is inherently dangerous if the file is maliciously modified. The code itself contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads; the security concern stems solely from executing external code without validation. The functions for color processing are benign. The main risk is supply chain attack potential if 'config.json' is compromised, allowing arbitrary code execution. The malware score is 0, as no malicious code is embedded. The obfuscated score is 0, given the straightforward code. The security risk score is high (~0.85), reflecting the danger of executing untrusted code. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but insecure due to the use of exec() on external input, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if 'config.json' is maliciously altered. The primary security risk is supply chain attack potential. No malware or obfuscation is present in the code. The risk score should be high, around 0.85, consistent with the vulnerability of executing unvalidated external code.",
