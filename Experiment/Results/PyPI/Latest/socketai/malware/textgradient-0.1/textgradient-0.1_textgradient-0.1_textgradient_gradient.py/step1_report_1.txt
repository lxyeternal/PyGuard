{
  "purpose": "The code generates gradient-colored text output and dynamically loads and executes a startup code from a configuration file.",
  "sources": "Reading the file 'config.json' in load_config() function",
  "sinks": "exec() in main() function, executing code loaded from the configuration file",
  "flows": "load_config() reads 'config.json' -> exec(code) executes the loaded code",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run dynamically loaded code, which can be malicious if the config file is tampered with; no input validation for the config content.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles text color transformation and reads a startup script from 'config.json'. The 'exec()' function is used to run the code obtained from the config file, which is a significant security concern because it allows arbitrary code execution if the configuration file is maliciously altered. There are no other suspicious functions, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments. The code's purpose is benign if trusted configuration files are used, but the use of 'exec()' on external input poses high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The main security concern is the use of 'exec()' on content loaded from a configuration file. If an attacker modifies 'config.json' to include malicious code, it will execute with the privileges of this script, posing a high security risk. There are no signs of malware or obfuscation, but the dynamic code execution represents a severe vulnerability.",
