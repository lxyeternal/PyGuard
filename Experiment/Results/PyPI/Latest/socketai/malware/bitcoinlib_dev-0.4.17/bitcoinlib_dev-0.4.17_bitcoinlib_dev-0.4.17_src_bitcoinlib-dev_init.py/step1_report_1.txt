  "purpose": "The code imports core modules and runs a pre-install check if the installer module is available.",
  "sources": "Import statements: from .cli, from .version, and from .installer",
  "sinks": "run_pre_install() function call, which executes during import if available",
  "flows": "Import statements -> conditional run_pre_install() execution",
  "anomalies": "The conditional import and execution of run_pre_install() is unusual; it runs code during module import, which may be considered risky if run_pre_install() performs malicious or unintended actions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module exports and attempts to execute a pre-install check during import. The try-except block is designed to import and run run_pre_install() if available, which could potentially be malicious if run_pre_install() contains harmful code. However, without the implementation details of run_pre_install(), it is impossible to determine its safety. The pattern itself is not inherently malicious but could be exploited if the function is malicious or altered maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code's structure is standard for package setup, but the execution of code during import via run_pre_install() introduces a potential risk. Without inspecting run_pre_install(), this remains a cautious observation rather than a definitive malicious indicator.",
