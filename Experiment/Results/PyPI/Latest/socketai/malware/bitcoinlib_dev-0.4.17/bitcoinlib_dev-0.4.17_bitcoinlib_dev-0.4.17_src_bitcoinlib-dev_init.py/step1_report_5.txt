  "purpose": "The code is setting up module exports and conditionally executing a pre-install check during installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .cli, .version, and .installer",

  "flows": "Import of run_pre_install() from .installer, executed immediately if import succeeds",
  "anomalies": "Conditional execution of run_pre_install() during import; no visible input handling or data processing",
  "analysis": "The code defines exports for main and version, then attempts to import run_pre_install from a local installer module. If successful, run_pre_install() is executed immediately. This pattern is common for setup or installation checks. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious behavior is evident. The immediate call to run_pre_install() could perform various setup tasks, but without seeing its implementation, there's no indication of malicious activity. The try-except block suppresses import errors, which is standard for optional setup steps.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script that conditionally runs pre-install checks. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
