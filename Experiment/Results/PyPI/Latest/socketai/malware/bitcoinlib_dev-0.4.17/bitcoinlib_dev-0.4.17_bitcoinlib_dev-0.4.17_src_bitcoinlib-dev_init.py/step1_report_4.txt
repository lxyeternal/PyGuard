{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package's __init__.py file, initializing module exports and running pre-install checks.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own __version__ and attempts to import and execute run_pre_install from a local installer module.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or external input in this code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing main and __version__, then attempts to import and execute run_pre_install if available.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable behavior is the conditional import and execution of run_pre_install, which is meant for pre-install checks. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes the module by defining exported names. It then tries to import run_pre_install from a local installer module and executes it if available, ignoring ImportError. This pattern is common for setup or installation routines. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code's purpose appears to be legitimate pre-install validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a Python package's initialization and pre-install checks, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
