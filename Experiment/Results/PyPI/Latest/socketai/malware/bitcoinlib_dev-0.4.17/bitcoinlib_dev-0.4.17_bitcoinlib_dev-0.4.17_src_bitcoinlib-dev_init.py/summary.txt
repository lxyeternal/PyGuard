  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup pattern with a conditional pre-install check. While executing code during import can be exploited if 'run_pre_install()' is malicious, there is no evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The scores assigned are reasonable; the malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is absent, and the risk score can be slightly increased to reflect the potential risk inherent in this pattern. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants caution regarding the implementation of 'run_pre_install()'."
