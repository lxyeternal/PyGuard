  "purpose": "Defines module exports and runs a pre-install check if the installer module is available.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .cli, .version, and .installer modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of run_pre_install during module import, which could have side effects if malicious.",
  "flows": "Import of run_pre_install and its execution during import if the module exists.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic execution of run_pre_install upon import is unusual; if run_pre_install contains malicious code, it could execute unintentionally.",
  "analysis": "The code imports main functions and version info, then attempts to import and run run_pre_install. This behavior is common in setup or initialization scripts to perform checks before installation. The try-except block ensures no error if the installer module is absent. No evidence of malicious code or suspicious behavior in the visible code; potential concern if run_pre_install contains malicious logic, but this cannot be determined from this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform standard module initialization tasks with a pre-install hook, which is not inherently malicious. The only notable point is the automatic invocation of run_pre_install, which could be exploited if malicious in the implementation of that function, but no malicious behavior is evident here.",
