  "purpose": "The code initializes a Python package by importing core modules and conditionally executing a pre-install check during import if available.",

  "sinks": "Execution of 'run_pre_install()' during module import, which could execute arbitrary code if malicious.",

  "anomalies": "Execution of code during import, which is common but can be exploited if 'run_pre_install()' is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code pattern is standard for setup routines, exposing core symbols and performing pre-install checks. The main concern is executing 'run_pre_install()' during import, which could be risky if the function contains malicious code. No suspicious data flows, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is appropriately 0, given no evidence of malicious intent. The security risk score is low (0.2-0.3), reflecting the inherent risk of executing code during import but no concrete malicious indicators. The confidence in this assessment is high, as the pattern is common and no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup pattern with a conditional pre-install check. While executing code during import can be exploited if 'run_pre_install()' is malicious, there is no evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The scores assigned are reasonable; the malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is absent, and the risk score can be slightly increased to reflect the potential risk inherent in this pattern. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants caution regarding the implementation of 'run_pre_install()'.",
