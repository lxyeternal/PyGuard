  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations about the code:**\n\n- The code imports core modules (`cli`, `version`) and conditionally imports and executes `run_pre_install` from `.installer`.\n- The execution of `run_pre_install()` occurs during module import if the module exists.\n- This pattern is typical in setup or initialization scripts, especially for pre-install checks.\n- No suspicious data flows, hardcoded secrets, or network activity are present.\n- The main concern is executing code during import, which could be exploited if `run_pre_install()` is malicious or altered.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Focuses on the unusual execution of `run_pre_install()` during import.\n- Notes that without inspecting `run_pre_install()`, safety can't be assured.\n- Confidence: 0.6\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.3\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The reasoning is cautious and reasonable.\n- The code pattern is not inherently malicious but warrants scrutiny.\n- The malware score is appropriately zero, given no evidence of malicious code.\n- The security risk is moderate due to execution during import.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Keep the malware score at 0.\n- Security risk could be slightly increased if the function is critical, but given no evidence, 0.3 seems acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Emphasizes that executing `run_pre_install()` during import is unusual but not malicious.\n- Finds no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The conclusion aligns with the code's pattern.\n- The reasoning is sound; no malicious intent detected.\n- Malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk is low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to previous reports, notes the standard pattern and the potential risk if `run_pre_install()` is malicious.\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The assessment is consistent.\n- No evidence of malicious activity.\n- Malware score remains at 0, appropriate.\n- Security risk is low.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Recognizes the code as standard initialization with no malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Very consistent with the code.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score remains at 0.\n- Security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Same pattern: standard setup with conditional execution.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Correctly identifies the pattern.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior.\n- Malware score remains at 0.\n- Security risk is low.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1–0.3). Given the execution of code during import, a small risk exists, but it's typical for setup scripts.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0** across all reports.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at **0**.\n- The **risk score** could be slightly increased to **0.2** or **0.3** for all reports to reflect the potential concern of executing code during import, but not more, as there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert judgment:**\n\n**Malware score:** **0** (no evidence of malicious code)  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Risk score:** **0.2** (a mild concern due to executing code during import, which is common but potentially exploitable if `run_pre_install()` is malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code pattern itself is standard for setup routines.\n- The execution of `run_pre_install()` during import warrants caution but is not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence suggests malicious activity, so malware score remains at 0.\n- Obfuscation is absent.\n- The risk score can be slightly increased from the current 0.1–0.3 to 0.2 for a balanced view.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis reflects a cautious but justified stance based on the code provided.",
