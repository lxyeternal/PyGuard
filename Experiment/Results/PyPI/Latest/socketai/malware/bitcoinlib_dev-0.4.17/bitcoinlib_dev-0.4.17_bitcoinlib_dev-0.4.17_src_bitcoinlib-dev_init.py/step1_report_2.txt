  "purpose": "This code appears to set up a package's main interface, expose version info, and perform pre-install checks.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'cli', 'version', and optionally 'installer'. The call to 'run_pre_install()' during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or cause data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Importing modules (sources) and executing 'run_pre_install()' (potentially a pre-install hook).",
  "anomalies": "The invocation of 'run_pre_install()' during import is unusual but not inherently malicious; it could execute arbitrary code during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules to define the package's interface and version. It then attempts to run a pre-install check by importing 'run_pre_install' from 'installer' and executing it. The 'try-except' block ensures the code continues if 'installer' is not available, which is typical for optional setup steps. There are no suspicious data flows, hardcoded credentials, or network activity. The only notable aspect is executing code during import, which is common for setup hooks but could be misused in malicious packages. Overall, there is no evidence of malicious intent or malware in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard setup tasks with a pre-install hook. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent based on this snippet. The main concern is the execution of code during import, which should be scrutinized in the context of the entire package but does not directly indicate malicious activity here.",
