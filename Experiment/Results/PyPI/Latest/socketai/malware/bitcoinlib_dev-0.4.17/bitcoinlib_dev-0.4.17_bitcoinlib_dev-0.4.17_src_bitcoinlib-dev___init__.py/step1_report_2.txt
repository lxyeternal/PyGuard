{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing and possibly communicates with external services.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, files, or network requests; possibly calls subprocess or external APIs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input/env), through processing functions, to sinks (output/network).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard data handling tasks with clear function definitions. No code injection, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. No suspicious network connections or backdoors are found. Usage of third-party libraries seems appropriate and benign. The code structure indicates typical application logic without malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or anomalies in data flow were identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The code appears safe and standard for its apparent purpose.",
