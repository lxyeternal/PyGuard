  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points, external network calls, environment variables, file I/O, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file write/read, environment variable access, subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing, network functions, or environment variable usage.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is absent or minimal in all reports, with no suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. Report 2 describes benign data processing with no indicators of malicious intent, but the security risk score is slightly elevated at 0.2, which could be reduced to 0 for consistency. Report 4's confidence score is high despite no code content; it should be lowered to reflect the lack of actual code. Other reports correctly assign zero scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk, consistent with their content. Overall, the code appears benign, with no malicious or obfuscating features present.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent with their findings; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The minor adjustment of Report 4's confidence score from 0.9 to around 0.2 and possibly lowering Report 2's security risk from 0.2 to 0.1 would improve consistency. The overall malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, with low security risk scores reflecting the benign nature of the code snippets.",
