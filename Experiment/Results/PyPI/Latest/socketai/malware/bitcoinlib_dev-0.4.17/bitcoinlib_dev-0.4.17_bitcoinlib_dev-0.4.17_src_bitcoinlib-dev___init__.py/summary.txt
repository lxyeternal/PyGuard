  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent with their findings; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The minor adjustment of Report 4's confidence score from 0.9 to around 0.2 and possibly lowering Report 2's security risk from 0.2 to 0.1 would improve consistency. The overall malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, with low security risk scores reflecting the benign nature of the code snippets."
