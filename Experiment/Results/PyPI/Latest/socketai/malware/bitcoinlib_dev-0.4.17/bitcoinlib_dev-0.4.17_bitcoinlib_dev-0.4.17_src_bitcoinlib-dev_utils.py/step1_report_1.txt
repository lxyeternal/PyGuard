  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system and network information, locate specific files, and send data or files via Telegram, Discord, or a custom API endpoint, possibly for monitoring or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": [
    "Reading environment variables (os.environ.get('APPDATA'))",
    "Accessing the system platform (platform.system())",
    "Reading files from directories (os.listdir, os.path.exists, os.path.getsize)",
    "Reading file contents (open(file_path, 'rb'))",
    "Requests to external services (requests.get, requests.post)"

    "Reading and transmitting files' binary data",
    "Reading environment variables and system info that could be sensitive"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "System info is gathered (IP, location), then combined with user-defined text",
    "Files are selected based on extension and size constraints",
    "File contents are base64 encoded and sent to external endpoints",
    "System data and files flow from local storage and environment variables to remote servers via HTTP requests"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, and Discord webhook URL—these are sensitive credentials embedded in the code",
    "Extensive use of external request endpoints (Telegram, Discord, custom API) that may be used for data exfiltration",
    "Sending of potentially large files with size limits but no clear validation or user consent",
    "Presence of many empty lines and inconsistent formatting which could be obfuscation or an artifact of code editing",
    "No user input validation or authentication for the external requests, allowing potential misuse"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code’s core functionality involves collecting system information (IP, geolocation), gathering files from specific directories, and sending this data to external services including Telegram, Discord, and a custom API. It hardcodes sensitive credentials such as Telegram bot token and webhook URLs, which is suspicious. The code reads files, encodes them in base64, and transmits them, potentially leaking sensitive data. The extensive use of external API calls and the inclusion of credentials suggest a risk of data exfiltration. Although no explicit malicious commands like file deletion or system modification are present, the pattern of collecting system info and transmitting files is indicative of possible malicious data harvesting or surveillance activity. The code does not appear obfuscated but includes excessive blank lines and unnecessary imports that could be designed to obscure intent. Overall, the code appears to facilitate covert data collection and exfiltration, with significant security and privacy implications.",
  "conclusion": "The script is likely malicious or at least suspicious due to hardcoded credentials, data collection, and transmission to external endpoints without user consent. It appears designed for covert data exfiltration, making it high-risk for security and privacy. It should be reviewed and restricted from execution unless fully validated.",
