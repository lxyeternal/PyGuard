  "purpose": "Implement a command-line interface for managing Bitcoin wallets, including operations like wallet creation, updates, transaction handling, and database interactions.",
  "sources": "sys.argv, argparse arguments, file paths from arguments, imported modules and functions.",
  "sinks": "send_to_all method (transmitting data), database interactions, print statements, file existence checks.",
  "flows": "User inputs via command-line → arguments parsed → sensitive data (passwords, private keys, passphrases) sent to send_to_all or logged → potential data leakage or exposure.",
  "anomalies": "Printing sys.argv exposes all command-line inputs, including secrets; transmitting sensitive data via send_to_all without encryption; broad exception handling that suppresses errors; minimal input validation for file arguments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI for wallet management with no malicious payloads or obfuscation. However, it handles sensitive data insecurely by logging command-line arguments and transmitting secrets in plaintext through send_to_all, which could be intercepted or logged elsewhere. The broad exception handling may hide errors or malicious activity. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is data privacy and leakage due to these practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or obfuscation but exhibits insecure handling of sensitive data, leading to a moderate security risk. The main issues are the exposure of secrets via command-line logging and unencrypted transmission. These practices could lead to privacy leaks but do not constitute malicious activity.",
