  "purpose": "Manage Bitcoin wallets, including creation, listing, key generation, transaction import, and sending.",
  "sources": "Input from user arguments (wallet name, network, passphrase), JSON files for transactions, external wallet library functions.",
  "sinks": "Printing sensitive data such as passphrases, WIF keys, transaction hashes, and transaction sending functions.",
  "flows": "User inputs (args) influence wallet creation and transaction parameters; JSON transaction data flows into wallet transaction import; sensitive data flows from code to console output.",
  "anomalies": "Printing sensitive passphrases and private keys directly; lack of input validation on imported transaction files; incomplete multisig and key generation functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard wallet management tasks using bitcoinlib, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is printing sensitive data, which is insecure but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are present. The code reads transaction data from files without validation, which could be risky but not malicious. Overall, the code is straightforward, with low malware and obfuscation scores. The security risk is primarily due to insecure handling of sensitive info, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Bitcoin wallet utility with no malware or obfuscation detected. The main issue is insecure printing of sensitive data, which should be addressed for security best practices but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
