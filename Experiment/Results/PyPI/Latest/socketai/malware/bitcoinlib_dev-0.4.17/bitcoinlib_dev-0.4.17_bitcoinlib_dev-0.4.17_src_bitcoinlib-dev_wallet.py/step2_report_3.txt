  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard wallet management utility relying on bitcoinlib.\n- No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are detected.\n- Repeated concerns include printing sensitive data (passphrases, WIFs), which is insecure but not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious network activity.\n- The code handles external data (files, user input) straightforwardly, with some potential risks related to input validation, but nothing indicating malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, just insecure printing of sensitive info.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score (0.2) is appropriate given the security concern about printing sensitive data but no malicious activity.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard functions, no malicious code, insecure printing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous, appropriate low risk score.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard wallet operations, insecure print statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.3) due to printing sensitive info, still reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Standard functions, potential risk in importing unvalidated transaction data but no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate low risk, considering the potential for misuse of unvalidated input but no malware.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, standard functions, potential input validation issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with other low-risk assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there are no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.2–0.3, which is reasonable given the insecure printing of sensitive data but no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.8–0.9), appropriate given the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.2 — primarily due to insecure handling of sensitive data (printing passphrases and WIFs). While this is a security concern, it doesn't constitute a malicious risk.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n- The code's potential for misuse is minimal; the main security concern is the insecure handling of sensitive data.\n- The lack of input validation on imported transaction files could be a concern but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- The scores assigned across reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary unless emphasizing the security best practice of avoiding printing sensitive data.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2            |\n\nThe code appears benign, with only minor security best practices to improve.",
