{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python package module, likely intended for general use, possibly providing some utility functions or features.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include environment variables, function parameters, and imported modules. Specific source locations are not provided in the code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file I/O, subprocess calls, or data leaks via print/logging. No explicit sinks are identified in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Without concrete data flow or input handling shown, it is difficult to establish explicit source-to-sink paths. The code's flow seems straightforward without complex data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are evident. The code uses standard Python syntax and library calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module, with no apparent malicious logic, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation. It does not exhibit signs of malware such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or system disruption. The lack of explicit input/output operations and straightforward structure suggest normal behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears benign and standard for a Python package module.",
