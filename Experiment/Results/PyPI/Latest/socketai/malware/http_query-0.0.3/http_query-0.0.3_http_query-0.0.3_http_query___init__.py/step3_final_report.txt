  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, network calls, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via function calls, data processing, or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscation, unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports lack concrete code snippets, relying on pattern recognition and assumptions. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 or 0) are consistent with the absence of suspicious activity. Report 3's securityRisk score should be adjusted from 0.2 to 0 due to no evidence of code presence. Confidence levels are appropriate given the information. No false positives or overlooked risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "All reports correctly indicate no malicious code or obfuscation, with low security risk scores justified by the lack of evidence. Minor adjustment for Report 3's securityRisk score enhances accuracy. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified.",
