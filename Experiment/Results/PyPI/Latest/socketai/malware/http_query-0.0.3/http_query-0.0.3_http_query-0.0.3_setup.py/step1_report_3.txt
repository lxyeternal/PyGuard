  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'http_query', primarily for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Static data in package metadata (name, version, author, description, dependencies). No input sources observed.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling. The setup script does not perform runtime operations that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only defines package metadata and entry points.",
  "anomalies": "The description explicitly states 'Dont install this package, purely testing purpose', which suggests non-production intent. No code execution, data manipulation, or dynamic behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with static metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It does not contain any code that executes at runtime beyond the setup process. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a straightforward setup configuration for a package intended for testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. The explicit note about testing purposes indicates it is not intended for malicious activity. No security concerns identified.",
