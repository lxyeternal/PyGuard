{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging and installation details for the 'http_query' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependencies, and entry point definitions; specifically from the 'setuptools.setup()' call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data; the code only sets up package configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code is for package setup and does not process external data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "The description explicitly states 'Dont install this package, purely testing purpose,' which is unusual for production code but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' to configure package details, including name, version, packages, author, description, entry points, and dependencies. The description indicates it is a testing package and should not be installed, which is atypical but not malicious. The 'entry_points' define a CLI command linked to a function, but no actual code execution or data processing occurs within this setup script. The dependencies are standard and benign. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The code structure is typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent. Its unusual description suggests it is for testing purposes only. No security risks or malware behavior are evident.",
