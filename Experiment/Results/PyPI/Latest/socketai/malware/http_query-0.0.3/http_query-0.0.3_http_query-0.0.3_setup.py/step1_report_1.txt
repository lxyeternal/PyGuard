{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'http_query', primarily for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata from the script itself (name, version, author, description), and specifies dependencies ('click', 'requests').",
  "sinks": "The code defines an entry point 'http_query' which calls 'http_query.http_query:main', potentially executing user-defined code. No external untrusted data sources are directly invoked here.",
  "flows": "The setup process installs dependencies and registers a command-line script that executes the 'main' function from 'http_query.http_query'.",
  "anomalies": "The description explicitly states 'Dont install this package, purely testing purpose', which may indicate a testing or non-production environment. No suspicious or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It does not include any code that processes untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated/malicious code. The presence of an entry point suggests it is intended to run a user-defined main function, but there is no indication of malicious intent in this script alone. The description warns against installation, implying it is for testing or development only. No hardcoded credentials, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script appears benign, serving to configure a Python package for testing purposes. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks within this code.",
