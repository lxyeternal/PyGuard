  "purpose": "Package setup configuration for 'http_query', primarily for testing purposes, defining metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Metadata fields (name, version, author, description), dependencies ('click', 'requests'), entry point 'http_query.http_query:main'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no runtime data processing or external communication present in this script.",
  "flows": "Static package configuration; no data flows or dynamic code execution within this setup script.",
  "anomalies": "The description explicitly states 'Dont install this package, purely testing purpose', indicating it's for testing; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script with static metadata, dependencies, and an entry point. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign with malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The explicit testing note suggests non-production use. The actual security risk depends on the implementation of 'http_query.http_query:main', which is not provided, but the setup script itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, intended solely for testing, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
