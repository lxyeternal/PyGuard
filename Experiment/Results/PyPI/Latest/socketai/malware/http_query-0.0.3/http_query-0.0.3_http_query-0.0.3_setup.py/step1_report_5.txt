{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'http_query' with specified metadata, dependencies, and console entry points. It appears intended for testing purposes and does not perform any operations itself.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data for package configuration, dependencies, and metadata; no external or user input is processed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform any data output or external communication directly.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The description explicitly states 'Dont install this package, purely testing purpose', which is unusual for a production package. No suspicious code or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools configuration script that defines package metadata and dependencies. It does not include any code that reads user input, processes untrusted data, or executes external commands. The comment about testing purposes suggests the package is for development or testing only. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "This package setup script appears benign and intended solely for testing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks within this code.",
