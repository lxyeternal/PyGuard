{
  "purpose": "This setup script defines the packaging configuration for a Python project named 'http_query', intended for testing purposes only, without any indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata (name, version, author, description), package discovery via setuptools.find_packages(), and dependencies ('click' and 'requests'). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations. The script only performs package setup and dependency declaration.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists; the script is purely declarative, setting up package metadata and entry points.",
  "anomalies": "The description explicitly states 'Dont install this package, purely testing purpose', which is unusual and may suggest the package is not intended for production. No other anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration script using setuptools. It declares package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. The description notes that the package is for testing purposes only, indicating no malicious intent. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors or obfuscated code. The structure is typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign package setup file intended for testing. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code.",
