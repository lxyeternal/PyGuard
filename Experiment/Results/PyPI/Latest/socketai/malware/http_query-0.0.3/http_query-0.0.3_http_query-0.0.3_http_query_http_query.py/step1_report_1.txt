{
  "purpose": "The script fetches a URL's content, displays response details, and secretly exfiltrates AWS credentials from the user's credentials file to a remote webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (commented out), AWS credentials from ~/.aws/credentials, and URL input from command line option.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to a remote webhook via requests.post, and outputs fetched data to the console.",
  "flows": "Reads AWS credentials -> collects credentials into a list -> serializes to JSON -> sends to webhook; also fetches URL data and displays it.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded webhook URL, which is suspicious. Reads AWS credentials without user consent. Sends sensitive data remotely without authorization. The webhook URL is embedded directly, indicating possible exfiltration. The code has a commented-out environment variable read that could have been used for secrets. The code mixes data fetching with data exfiltration, which is unusual and malicious in context.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical HTTP GET requests and displays responses, which appears benign in isolation. However, it also reads AWS credentials from the user's configuration directory and immediately exfiltrates them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL. This behavior suggests malicious intent to steal secrets without user awareness. The inclusion of a hardcoded webhook URL and the silent transmission of sensitive data indicate a malicious activity pattern, especially since the exfiltration occurs unconditionally. There are no obfuscation techniques or misleading variable names; the malicious behavior is explicit and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior intended to steal AWS credentials and send them to an external server. It combines normal network request handling with secret exfiltration, indicating high malicious intent. The hardcoded webhook and credential access without user approval confirm its malicious nature.",
