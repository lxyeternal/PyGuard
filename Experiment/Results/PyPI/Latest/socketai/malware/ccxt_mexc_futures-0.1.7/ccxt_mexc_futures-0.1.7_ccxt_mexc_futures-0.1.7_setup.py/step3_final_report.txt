{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging the Python module 'ccxt-mexc_futures' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources; static code defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with empty author fields but no malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It does not contain dynamic code, user input handling, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. Dependencies are common packages ('ccxt', 'requests'). No hardcoded secrets or external data flows are present. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements indicate a benign package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
