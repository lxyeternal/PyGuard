  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'ccxt-mexc_futures' to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "User-defined data such as package name, version, description, author details, URL, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "targets": "Package installation process, metadata, dependencies, and distribution setup.",
  "flows": "Data flows from package metadata to the setup process, and dependencies are declared for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious or obfuscated code. No external or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It does not contain any input/output operations, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors. The fields are straightforward, with empty author and URL fields which could be filled, but this does not imply malicious intent. No signs of code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The dependencies listed are common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate configuration for a Python package with no malicious activity or security risks. It is a typical, non-suspicious package setup file.",
