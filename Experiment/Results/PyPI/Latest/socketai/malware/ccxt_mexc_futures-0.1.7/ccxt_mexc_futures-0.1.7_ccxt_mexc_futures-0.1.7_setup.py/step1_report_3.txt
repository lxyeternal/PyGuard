{
  "purpose": "This code is used to configure and package a Python project named 'ccxt-mexc_futures' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata such as package name, version, description, author info, URL, and dependencies from the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data affects system security; the script only defines package configuration.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to static metadata initialization within the setup() function, with no external data inputs or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code are present. All code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It specifies the package name, version, description, author info (empty), URL (empty), dependencies ('ccxt' and 'requests'), classifiers, and Python version requirement. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code, no external input handling, and no malicious constructs. It appears to be a typical setup.py configuration file for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this script.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is benign and serves solely for packaging purposes. It does not contain malicious code or security issues.",
