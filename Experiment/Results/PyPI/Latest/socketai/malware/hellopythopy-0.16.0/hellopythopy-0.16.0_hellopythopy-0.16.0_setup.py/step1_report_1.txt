{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package and execute a custom post-installation process that downloads and executes an external executable file.",
  "sources": "The 'send' function fetches a file from an external URL ('https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe') using the 'requests.get' method, and writes it to a local file 'ins42.exe'. It then runs the downloaded executable via 'os.system'.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call executes the downloaded executable, which can potentially run malicious code. The initial HTTP request retrieves external content that is then executed without validation.",
  "flows": "Source: 'requests.get' fetches the external executable -> save as 'ins42.exe' -> 'os.system' executes 'ins42.exe' which was downloaded from an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and executes an external executable during package installation without any validation, checksum, or user consent. This is a clear indicator of potentially malicious behavior. The URL points to an executable that is launched automatically, which is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that downloads an executable from an external URL and executes it immediately upon package installation. The 'CustomInstallCommand' class overrides the install process to invoke 'send'. This behavior occurs automatically during package setup, which could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. The download and execution happen without user approval or security checks. This pattern is characteristic of malicious supply chain attacks or malware deployment, as it runs external code during installation without transparency or safeguards.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation, which could harm the user's system or compromise security. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicates potential malware or supply chain attack.",
