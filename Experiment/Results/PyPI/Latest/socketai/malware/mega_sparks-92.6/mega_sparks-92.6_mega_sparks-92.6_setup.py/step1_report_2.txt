  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration with custom installation behavior that runs a main function after installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools modules; the run method invoking main from main.py",
  "sinks": "Calling main() in the run method after installation completes",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method executes, importing and calling main() from main.py",
  "anomalies": "The run method in the custom install class automatically executes main() post-installation, which could be malicious if main() performs harmful actions. No other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration with a custom install class CrazyInstallStrat that extends setuptools' install. During installation, it overrides run() to execute the standard installation process and then calls main() from main.py. This behavior is unusual because it runs code outside the typical install process, potentially executing malicious or unintended actions embedded within main(). The setup itself appears standard, but the automatic execution of main() after installation could be malicious if main() contains harmful code. No other anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary concern is the invocation of main() during installation, which could be malicious depending on main.py's content. Without inspecting main.py, this behavior raises a security concern. The setup script itself is not inherently malicious but is potentially dangerous because of the post-install execution of arbitrary code.",
