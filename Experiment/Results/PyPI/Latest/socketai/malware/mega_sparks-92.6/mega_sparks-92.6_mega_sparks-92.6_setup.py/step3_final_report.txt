{
  "purpose": "The setup script installs the package and executes the 'main()' function from 'main.py' during installation.",
  "sources": "The 'run()' method in 'CrazyInstallStrat' imports and calls 'main()' after the standard install process.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during setup can lead to arbitrary code execution, potential data exfiltration, or malicious activity if 'main()' contains harmful code.",
  "flows": "During installation, control flows from the 'run()' method to 'import main' and then to 'main()' execution, which may execute untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of 'main()' during setup is unusual and suspicious; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, after performing the standard installation, imports and executes 'main()' from 'main.py'. This pattern is uncommon and potentially dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The risk depends entirely on the contents of 'main.py'. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.4-0.5, security risk around 0.5-0.75) are reasonable, reflecting moderate concern. Given the pattern, a malware score of approximately 0.5 and a security risk score of about 0.75 are justified, especially since executing code during setup can be exploited maliciously. Without inspecting 'main.py', certainty is limited, but caution is warranted.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes 'main()' during installation, which is suspicious and could be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful code. The scores in the reports are appropriate, but the potential for malicious activity warrants treating this package with caution until 'main.py' is reviewed.",
