The scores in the reports are appropriate, but the potential for malicious activity warrants treating this package with caution until 'main.py' is reviewed."

While it lacks destructive payloads, its intent to silently gather and transmit system information without user consent classifies it as malicious in nature. The activity warrants a high security concern, with a malware score around 0.7 and a risk score near 0.75, reflecting privacy invasion and exfiltration risks."
