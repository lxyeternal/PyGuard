  "purpose": "Collect system information (host, user, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which reads network interface info",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() which sends HTTP GET requests to external URLs with parameters",
  "flows": "System info sources -> URL encoding -> HTTP requests to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with obfuscated hostnames, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, no validation or sanitization, possible tracking activity",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data to multiple external URLs. The URLs are unusual and could be part of a command-and-control or tracking infrastructure. The code does not perform any malicious actions like writing files or executing commands but could be used for fingerprinting or exfiltration of system info. No code injection or obvious backdoors are present. The obfuscation is limited to base64 encoding and the unusual URL hostnames. The use of subprocess to gather MAC addresses varies per OS, which is standard. The code's intent appears to be stealthy information gathering and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily collects system information and reports it to external servers, potentially for tracking or malicious surveillance. It does not perform destructive actions or directly harm the system but could be used for malicious purposes. The suspicious aspect is the obfuscated external URLs and the silent data exfiltration.",
