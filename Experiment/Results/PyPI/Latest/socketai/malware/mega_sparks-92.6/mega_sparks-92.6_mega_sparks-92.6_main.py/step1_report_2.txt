{
  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current directory, then send this data to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which executes system commands to retrieve MAC addresses, and base64-encoded MAC address data.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen calls that send data to external URLs with query parameters containing system information.",
  "flows": "Data from system info functions (hostname, username, current path, MAC addresses) flows into URL construction and is transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of system-dependent commands (getmac, ifconfig) which may behave differently across platforms; encoding of MAC addresses in base64 without clear purpose; multiple external URLs that may be suspicious; no explicit validation or sanitization of URL parameters; silent exception handling which suppresses errors.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system-specific data including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses obtained through platform-dependent system commands. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, possibly to obfuscate the data. It then constructs URLs pointing to external domains, appending the collected data as URL query parameters, and sends HTTP GET requests to these URLs without any response validation or handling. The URLs used appear suspicious and potentially malicious, designed to exfiltrate system information to third parties. The use of silent exception handling prevents detection of network or execution errors, further obscuring behavior. Overall, the code is designed to silently exfiltrate sensitive system information to external servers, which indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be malicious, as it covertly collects sensitive system information and transmits it to external, suspicious servers. The obfuscation of MAC addresses, use of unverified URLs, and silent failure handling suggest it is designed for malicious data exfiltration.",
