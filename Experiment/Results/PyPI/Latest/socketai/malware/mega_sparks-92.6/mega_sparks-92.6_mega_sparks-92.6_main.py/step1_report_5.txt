  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to external URLs encoded in base64, possibly for tracking or reconnaissance purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading system info: platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() (which reads network interfaces).",
  "sinks": "Sending data via urllib.request.urlopen() to external URLs with constructed query parameters.",
  "flows": "System info sources -> encoding (base64 of MAC addresses) -> URL parameter assembly -> HTTP requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external URLs (including obfuscated or non-standard domains). Encoding MAC addresses in base64 suggests an attempt to obscure data exfiltration. No user interaction or obvious benign purpose shown.",
  "analysis": "The script collects MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current working directory. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to external domains. The URLs appear suspicious, possibly used for tracking or exfiltration. There are no checks for secure communication, no user consent prompts, and the external domains are potentially malicious or used for malicious purposes. The code does not perform any destructive actions but leaks system info. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution appears present beyond standard Python features. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors silently, which could hide issues or intentional obfuscation of failure handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for system information collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains, potentially malicious. It lacks user consent prompts, uses obfuscated-looking URLs, and encodes data to evade detection. Although no direct destructive behavior is evident, the pattern suggests tracking or reconnaissance activity with potential malicious intent.",
