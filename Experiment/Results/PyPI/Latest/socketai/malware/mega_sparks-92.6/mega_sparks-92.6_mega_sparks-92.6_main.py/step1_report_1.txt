  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs encoded in base64 within URL parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads system info from platform, getpass, os, and subprocess; gathers MAC addresses; retrieves current directory; generates random number.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests to external URLs with embedded data via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "System info and MAC addresses are gathered -> base64 encoded -> included as URL parameters -> URL requests are made to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple external URLs that are suspicious and unlikely to be legitimate; no validation or authentication is performed; sensitive data (hostname, username, MAC addresses) are encoded and sent without encryption or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code collects environment details such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses across different OS platforms. The MAC addresses are encoded in base64 and sent as URL parameters to three external domains that appear suspicious. The URLs do not seem to serve legitimate purposes and could be used for tracking or data exfiltration. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or destructive actions are present; however, the activity suggests potentially malicious tracking or data collection without user knowledge. The code does not perform any malicious actions itself but can be considered a privacy violation or component of a malicious data collection operation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to silently collect and transmit system identifiers to external servers, likely for tracking or malicious surveillance. While it does not perform destructive actions, its activity and suspicious URLs imply malicious intent or at least privacy intrusion. No obfuscation or malware signatures are evident, but the data exfiltration behavior warrants caution.",
