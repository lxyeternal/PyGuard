      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The placeholder URL and empty author fields are typical placeholders, not security concerns. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The slight risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified by incomplete configuration data but does not indicate any security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious code if 'info' is malicious. Without inspecting 'info', the risk remains low but non-zero. The overall assessment supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a security risk score around 0.2."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, primarily due to remote code fetch and execution from obfuscated URLs, minimal validation, and error suppression. It should be classified as highly suspicious or malicious, warranting further investigation and caution before use."
