{
  "purpose": "To perform a supply chain security assessment of the Python code snippet 'from .info import *', focusing on potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module '.info' via a wildcard import.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the namespace where symbols from 'info' are imported; if 'info' contains malicious code, it could lead to hidden behaviors or malicious actions when symbols are used.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; if 'info' contains malicious code, symbols could be used elsewhere in the codebase, leading to malicious behavior. However, in this snippet, no such flows are directly observable.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' from a local module can obscure imported symbols, potentially hiding malicious code. No actual malicious code or obfuscation is present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import with a wildcard, which is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution and potential concealment of malicious code. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is present in this snippet. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with the main concern being the import pattern's potential to hide malicious content if 'info' is compromised. Given the lack of content in 'info', the malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) to reflect the caution warranted by the import style.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious code if 'info' is malicious. Without inspecting 'info', the risk remains low but non-zero. The overall assessment supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a security risk score around 0.2.",
