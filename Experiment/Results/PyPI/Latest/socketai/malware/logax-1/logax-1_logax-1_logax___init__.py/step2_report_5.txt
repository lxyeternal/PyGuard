  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code is a straightforward import statement.\n- It uses a relative import (`from .info import *`), which is common in package modules.\n- The use of wildcard import (`*`) is generally discouraged because it obscures which symbols are imported, potentially leading to namespace pollution or hiding malicious code if the imported module is compromised.\n- There is no direct malicious activity or code execution in this snippet.\n- The actual security implications depend heavily on the content of the `info` module, which is not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the import as simple, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6 — reasonable, given the minimal context.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the assessment that there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — a low but non-zero risk due to wildcard import.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues with the scoring or reasoning.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.4 — slightly lower, reflecting less certainty but still reasonable.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar conclusion; standard import, low risk.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence; justified given the simplicity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound reasoning and scoring.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Repeats previous findings; no malicious activity, just the import.\n- **Confidence:** 0.3 — lower confidence, perhaps due to the minimal context.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — low risk, as the wildcard import can be risky but not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Recognizes that `import *` can hide malicious code if `info` contains harmful symbols.\n- **Concerns:** Correctly flags the potential risk due to obscurity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5 — moderate, acknowledging uncertainty about `info`.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — still no direct evidence of malware.\n- **Security risk:** 0.3 — slightly higher due to the potential for malicious content in `info`.\n\n**Critical Point:** The report emphasizes that the import pattern itself isn't malicious but could conceal malicious code if `info` is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the information. No evidence of malicious code in the import statement itself.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is not obfuscated.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low, reflecting the minimal code snippet but acknowledging the risk associated with wildcard imports.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 — considering the wildcard import, but overall low since there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code snippet, and their reasoning is sound. The scores are reasonable, though the risk could be slightly increased if the `info` module's content is unknown or untrusted, but given only this import statement, the current scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The analysis correctly reflects the benign nature of this code snippet, with appropriate caution about the use of wildcard imports.",
