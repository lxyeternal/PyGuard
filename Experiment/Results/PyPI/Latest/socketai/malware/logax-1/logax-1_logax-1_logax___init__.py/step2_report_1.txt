  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue Presence:** The code is a simple `from .info import *`. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is present.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The report correctly notes that the wildcard import can be poor practice but is not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.6. These seem reasonable given the minimal context.\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score aligns with the lack of suspicious activity. The confidence is moderate, acknowledging the potential issues with wildcard imports but no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue Presence:** Same import pattern, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Properly states that the import is benign but notes the poor practice of `import *`.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 0.4. The security risk could be slightly increased due to the import style, but overall, this seems appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious activity, so the low scores are justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue Presence:** Same pattern, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Correctly notes the benign nature but mentions that the import pattern is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9. The high confidence is justified given the simplicity and lack of suspicious indicators.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue Presence:** Same import pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Reiterates that wildcard import can be risky but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.3. Slightly lower confidence reflects the minimal context.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; the low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue Presence:** Same import pattern, with a note that `import *` can conceal malicious code.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Correctly identifies that the pattern can hide malicious content in 'info'.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.3, Confidence = 0.5. The moderate risk score is justified given the potential for malicious code in the imported module, which is unverified.\n- **Justification:** The pattern itself is not malicious, but the potential for malicious code in 'info' warrants a higher risk score than the others.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code snippet alone. However, the last report notes potential risk depending on 'info's content. Since we cannot verify 'info', a slight increase in malware risk could be considered, but given the data, 0 remains appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Risk Scores:** Most are low, except report 5, which is slightly higher due to potential concealment of malicious code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are generally consistent with the analysis.\n- The higher risk in report 5 is justified given the potential for malicious content in 'info'.\n- The overall malware risk remains low based solely on this import statement, but the pattern of wildcard import from a local module warrants caution.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — No evidence of malicious code in the import statement itself.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — The use of wildcard import is a poor practice and could hide malicious code, but the snippet alone is benign.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are thorough and reasonable. The main concern is the potential risk introduced by the use of `import *`, especially in report 5, but no actual malicious activity is evident from the provided code snippet.",
