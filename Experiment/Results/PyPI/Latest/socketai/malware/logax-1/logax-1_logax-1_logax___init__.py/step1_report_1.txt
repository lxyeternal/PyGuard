  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'info'.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing data from the local 'info' module.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow identified beyond the import statement; imported data may be used elsewhere in the package.",
  "anomalies": "The import uses a wildcard '*', which can hide the actual imported contents and potentially lead to unintended behavior or conflicts. No suspicious code or behavior is present in this single line.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing all symbols from a relative module 'info'. There is no executable logic, data processing, or network activity in this snippet. The use of wildcard import could be considered poor practice but is not inherently malicious. Without additional context or code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic module import with no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on this single line. The use of wildcard import warrants caution but is not malicious on its own.",
