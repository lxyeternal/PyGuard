  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a straightforward `from .info import *`. No evidence of malicious behavior or code execution.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The report correctly notes that wildcard import can hide contents but isn't malicious by itself.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. Security risk is low (0.1), which seems reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The import is benign; no suspicious activity is indicated.\n- **Conclusion:** Acceptable as is.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same import pattern, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Correctly identifies the poor practice of `import *` but no malicious implications.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same import, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Appropriately notes the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1; acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same import, no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Correctly emphasizes that wildcard import can obscure malicious code but doesn't confirm maliciousness.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1; consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same import pattern, with added concern that `import *` can hide malicious code in 'info'.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The report rightly highlights that without inspecting 'info', risk cannot be fully assessed.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, which is reasonable unless 'info' contains malicious code.\n- **Justification:** Since the code only imports, and no malicious activity is evident, the malware score remains at 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The caution is justified; the overall risk is low but warrants further inspection of 'info'.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code snippet alone. Without inspecting 'info', we cannot confirm malicious content.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly low (0.1 or 0.3), which seems appropriate given the minimal code and lack of evidence.\n\n### My Final Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and simple.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk based on the import pattern alone; the main concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious code if 'info' is malicious.\n\n**Overall,** the code snippet is benign but the use of wildcard import warrants caution. Further inspection of the 'info' module is recommended to rule out hidden malicious content.",
