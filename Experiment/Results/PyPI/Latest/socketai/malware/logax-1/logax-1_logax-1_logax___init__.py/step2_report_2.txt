  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code snippets to determine their validity, consistency, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports analyze the same code: `from .info import *`.\n- The core concern revolves around the use of wildcard import (`import *`), which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code.\n- None of the reports present evidence of malicious activity within this code snippet itself; they mostly highlight the risks associated with the import pattern.\n- The security risk scores assigned are generally low (0.1 to 0.3), which seems appropriate given the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Basic import, no malicious behavior, wildcard import warrants caution.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No signs of malicious activity; the concern is mainly about coding style.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes poor practice but no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.4\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The absence of malicious indicators aligns with the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Benign, standard pattern, low risk.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (high confidence in benignity)\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. The high confidence reflects the benign nature of this pattern.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, highlights potential obscurity due to wildcard import.\n- **Confidence:** 0.3 (lower confidence, possibly due to uncertainty)\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No malicious activity detected, but the concern about obscurity remains.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Noted that importing all symbols can hide malicious code in 'info'; recommends caution.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.3\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The main concern is the potential for malicious code within 'info', which cannot be assessed without inspecting that module.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Points & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** The code snippet itself is benign; no malware or obfuscated code is evident.\n- **Use of `import *`:** While discouraged, it is not inherently malicious but warrants caution because it can hide malicious code if present in 'info'.\n- **Risk scores:** All assigned scores are reasonable given the limited context. The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is appropriate unless further inspection reveals malicious content.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & Suggested Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity in the snippet)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** Considering the potential for malicious code in 'info', but no evidence in the import statement itself, a **risk score of around 0.2** seems appropriate, reflecting low but non-zero concern due to the pattern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior.\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious code if present in 'info'.\n- Without inspecting 'info', the risk remains speculative but should be noted.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis conservative approach balances the benign nature of the code with the potential risks associated with obscure imports.",
