{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a module named 'info' in the same package, likely to access data or functions defined there.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'info'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code itself does not process untrusted data or write data to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible in this single line of import; potential data flow depends on how imported content is used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; the only notable point is the use of 'import *', which can obscure the actual data and make analysis harder but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a wildcard import from a local module 'info'. It does not contain any logic, data processing, network activity, or other behaviors. As such, it does not present any immediate security risks or malicious intent. The use of 'import *' can be considered a poor practice but does not indicate malicious activity by itself.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code's security profile depends on the contents of 'info', which are not provided. No malware or obfuscation is evident.",
