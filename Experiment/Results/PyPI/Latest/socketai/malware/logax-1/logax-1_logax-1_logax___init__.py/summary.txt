  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious code if 'info' is malicious. Without inspecting 'info', the risk remains low but non-zero. The overall assessment supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a security risk score around 0.2."
