{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the local module named 'info'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the contents of the '.info' module.",
  "sinks": "None directly, as this is a simple import statement.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can hide malicious or unintended code, but on its own, it's not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement importing all symbols from a local module named 'info'. Without additional context or the content of 'info', there are no evident malicious behaviors. Wildcard imports can be risky by obscuring imported symbols, but they are not inherently malicious. No other suspicious activity or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risk. The code is minimal and appears benign, but reliance on the imported module's content remains unverified.",
