  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports concern the same code snippet: `from .info import *`.\n- The core concern is the use of `import *` from a local module `info`.\n- No other code or context is provided, limiting the ability to assess actual malicious activity.\n- The content of `info` is unknown, so any assessment about its safety or maliciousness is speculative.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; describes the import and notes no malicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import is noted as poor practice but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.6.\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score aligns with the analysis. The confidence is moderate, given the minimal code.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to Report 1; confirms no immediate risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.4.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; the absence of risk is consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same pattern; low risk, benign appearance.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** High confidence in benign nature; scores align.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar, with emphasis on wildcard import's potential to hide malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.3.\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score reflects the lack of evidence. The confidence is low, which is reasonable given the minimal context.\n\n**Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Recognizes the use of `import *` as suspicious due to obscurity, with potential for malicious code hiding.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.3, confidence=0.5.\n- **Assessment:** The higher security risk score is justified, considering the potential risks of importing all symbols from an unknown module. The confidence level is moderate, acknowledging uncertainty.\n\n**Verdict:** Justified, but since no actual malicious activity is demonstrated, the malware score remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement.\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which can obscure malicious intent if the imported module is malicious.\n- Since the content of `info` is unknown, no evidence of malware or malicious behavior exists in the provided code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0**, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Considering the potential for hidden malicious code in `info`, a cautious approach would be to assign a **0.2–0.3** risk score, reflecting the risk of importing untrusted code via `import *`. Since the current scores are mostly at 0 or very low, and no actual malicious activity is present, I suggest **0.2**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Suggested Value | Justification                                                      |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                       | No evidence of malicious code present.                              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                       | Code is clear; no obfuscation detected.                              |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2                     | The use of `import *` from an unknown module could hide malicious code, warranting some caution. |\n\n**Overall, the reports are reasonable, and the scores align with the evidence.**",
