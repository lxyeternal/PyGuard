{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a module named 'info', likely to access functions, variables, or classes defined there.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the 'info' module within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks are evident from this single import statement.",
  "flows": "The imported contents may be used elsewhere; no data flow is visible in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .info import *' can be considered suspicious as it imports everything from a local module without explicitness, potentially hiding malicious code or side effects in the imported module.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a relative import from a module named 'info' within the same package. It doesn't execute any malicious behavior by itself but raises concerns because it imports all symbols without explicit control. The security implications depend heavily on the content of 'info'. If 'info' contains malicious code, then importing all symbols could facilitate malicious activity. The import statement itself is simple and standard, but the use of 'import *' is discouraged due to obscurity and potential for hiding malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal import statement with no direct malicious activity. However, the use of 'import *' from a local module could conceal malicious or harmful code within 'info'. Without inspecting the 'info' module, it's impossible to definitively assess security risk, but the pattern warrants caution.",
