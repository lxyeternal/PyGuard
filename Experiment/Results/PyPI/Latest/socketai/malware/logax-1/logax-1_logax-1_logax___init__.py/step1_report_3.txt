  "purpose": "The code imports all definitions from a local module named 'info'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks present; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only static import occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies detected in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of all contents from a relative module 'info'. This is a common pattern for including package-specific data or functions. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior are present. Since the code is only an import statement, there's no malicious activity evident in this snippet. The minimal structure and standard import pattern suggest low risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign and is likely part of normal package structure. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
