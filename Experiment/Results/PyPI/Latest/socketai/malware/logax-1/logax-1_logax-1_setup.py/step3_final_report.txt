  "flows": "Reading file -> setup() parameters",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder URL and empty author fields, but typical in templates",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools, with static metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The placeholder URL and empty author info are common in initial templates and do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or malicious code detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The minor risk score reflects incomplete info, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The placeholder URL and empty author fields are typical placeholders, not security concerns. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The slight risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified by incomplete configuration data but does not indicate any security threat.",
