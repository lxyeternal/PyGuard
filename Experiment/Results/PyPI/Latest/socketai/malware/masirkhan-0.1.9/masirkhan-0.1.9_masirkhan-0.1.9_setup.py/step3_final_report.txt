{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that, during package installation, collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address, indicating covert data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The untrusted data (system info) is sent via requests.get() to an external IP address, which could lead to data leakage or privacy violations.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system variables (hostname, cwd, username) and transmitted directly via requests.get() to the hardcoded IP, with no validation or user notification.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during installation without user consent, using a hardcoded IP address; no obfuscation or validation is present; the behavior is suspicious and covert.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a custom install class that, upon execution, gathers system info and sends it to an external server via an HTTP GET request. This pattern indicates covert data exfiltration. The IP address is hardcoded, and no user notification or validation occurs, which is suspicious. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but its behavior aligns with malicious activity. The high confidence score (0.9) reflects the clear exfiltration pattern. The malware score is high (0.9), and the security risk score is similarly high (0.9), given the privacy breach and potential for abuse in supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly exfiltrating system information during package installation. The hardcoded IP and lack of user consent confirm malicious intent. The scores of malware (0.9) and security risk (0.9) are justified and consistent with the observed behavior.",
