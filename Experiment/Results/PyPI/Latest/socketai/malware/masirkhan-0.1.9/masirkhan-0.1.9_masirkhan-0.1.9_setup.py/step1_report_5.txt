  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup that includes a custom installation step which reports system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, current working directory, and username using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "Requests to 'http://192.198.82.14:3000/log' with collected system data.",
  "flows": "Collects system info (source), then sends it via an HTTP GET request to a remote server (sink) during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a hidden data exfiltration mechanism embedded in the package installation process. The IP address used is suspicious and potentially malicious. No user notification or consent is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python modules to gather hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this information to a remote server through an HTTP request during the installation process, which is unusual for typical package setup scripts. The remote server IP appears hardcoded and suspicious. This behavior indicates an attempt to collect system data without user awareness, which could be used for malicious purposes such as profiling or unauthorized surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a covert data exfiltration mechanism during package installation, indicating malicious intent. It compromises user privacy by sending system information to an external server without consent. The overall security risk is high, and this package should be considered malicious.",
