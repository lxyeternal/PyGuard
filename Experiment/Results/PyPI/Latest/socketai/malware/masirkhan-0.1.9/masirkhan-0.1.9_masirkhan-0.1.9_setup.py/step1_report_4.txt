{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that customizes the installation process to perform additional actions during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username. It also imports external modules requests, socket, getpass, and os.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends collected data to an external IP address, potentially leaking sensitive information.",
  "flows": "The system information collected (hostname, cwd, username) flows directly into an HTTP GET request to a remote server, occurring during the installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a network request during package installation that transmits system data to an external IP address without user consent, which is suspicious. No hardcoded credentials are present, but the behavior resembles data exfiltration. The IP address used (192.198.82.14) is unusual and could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script leverages setuptools to define package metadata and overrides the install command to execute custom code post-installation. During the custom run, it collects system info and sends it to an external IP address via an HTTP request. This behavior resembles a supply chain attack, as the package exfiltrates system data without explicit user awareness. The use of standard modules for data collection and the timing of data exfiltration during install is suspicious. There are no indications of obfuscation or malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This package performs potentially malicious data exfiltration during installation by sending system info to an external server. The behavior suggests malicious intent or at least a security risk, possibly a supply chain attack or malicious backdoor.",
