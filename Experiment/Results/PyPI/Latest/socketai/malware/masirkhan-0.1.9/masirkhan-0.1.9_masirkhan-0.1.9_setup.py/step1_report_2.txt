{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process with a custom install command that collects system information and sends it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), requests.get() in the run() method of CustomInstall class",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call that transmits system information to a specified remote IP address",
  "flows": "During installation, system information (hostname, current working directory, username) is collected and sent via an HTTP GET request to the remote server",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits system information to an external server during the installation process without user consent; hardcoded IP address; no validation or obfuscation of data; use of standard library functions in a way that could be leveraged for data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script that includes a custom install class. When the package is installed, it executes a request to an external IP address, sending system info such as hostname, current directory, and username. This behavior is suspicious because it collects potentially sensitive information and transmits it without user knowledge or consent. No input validation or obfuscation is performed. The IP address is hardcoded, which is a common trait in malicious or unauthorized data exfiltration scripts. The use of standard modules (socket, os, getpass, requests) is normal, but their combination here indicates malicious intent to gather and leak system info during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and sending it to a remote server during package installation without user awareness. This is a clear supply chain attack vector aiming to exfiltrate user data or system details covertly.",
