{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom install command that sends system information to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), requests.get()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call that transmits data to an external IP address",
  "flows": "During installation, system info (hostname, current directory, username) is collected and sent to the remote server via an HTTP GET request.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends potentially sensitive system information to an external IP address during installation; the URL used suggests possible malicious intent or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command in setuptools to perform an additional step after installation. It gathers system hostname, current working directory, and username, then makes an HTTP GET request to an IP address, potentially leaking user environment data. No input validation or user consent is evident. The IP address (192.198.82.14:3000) may belong to an attacker-controlled server, indicating malicious data exfiltration. No other malicious behaviors like code injection, obfuscation, or backdoors are present, but the data exfiltration behavior is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating user environment information to an external server during installation, indicating a supply chain attack or malicious intent.",
