  "purpose": "Define a setup configuration for a Python package that includes a custom installation command.",
  "sources": "Code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected system information via an HTTP GET request to a specified IP address and port.",
  "flows": "During installation, hostname, cwd, and username are collected and sent to http://192.198.82.14:3000/log.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during installation without user consent, targeting an external IP address. No validation or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a custom install class that extends setuptools. During the run method, it collects system hostname, current directory, and username. Instead of typical setup behavior, it sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an IP address and port, which is unusual and potentially malicious. This pattern resembles data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The IP address appears suspicious and hardcoded, indicating possible malicious intent. No other suspicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to a remote server during installation without user consent. The pattern and hardcoded IP suggest malicious intent, likely for tracking or malicious data collection.",
