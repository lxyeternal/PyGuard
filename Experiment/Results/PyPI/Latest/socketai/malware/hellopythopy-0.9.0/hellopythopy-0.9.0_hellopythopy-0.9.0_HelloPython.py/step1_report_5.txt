  "purpose": "Write a greeting message to a text file in the user's AppData directory",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'APPDATA' to get the AppData path",
  "sinks": "Writing to a file located at the AppData directory",
  "flows": "os.getenv('APPDATA') -> file path creation -> open/write to file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of environment variable is standard for user-specific paths.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves the APPDATA environment variable, constructs a file path, and writes a greeting message to 'text.txt' in that directory. It performs basic file I/O operations without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. The use of environment variables and file writing appears legitimate and benign, serving a simple informational purpose. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a straightforward file write operation in the user's AppData directory without any malicious behavior or security issues.",
