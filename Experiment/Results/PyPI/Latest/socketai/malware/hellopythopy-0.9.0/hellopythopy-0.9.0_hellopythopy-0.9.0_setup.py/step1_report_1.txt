  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to download and execute an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe' used in requests.get() and the call to os.system() with the downloaded filename.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call that executes the downloaded file 'ins42.exe'.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves the executable, then open().write() saves it locally, followed by os.system() executing the file.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading an executable directly during installation and automatically running it without user consent is highly suspicious. The use of a non-standard URL and immediate execution indicates malicious intent or backdoor behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the standard setup procedure to include a custom install command. This command downloads a potentially malicious executable from an external URL, saves it locally, and then runs it immediately. The executable is not verified, and there are no safeguards such as user confirmation or checksum validation. This behavior is indicative of malicious or maliciously-intended backdoor activity, as it can silently install and run harmful software during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable without user approval, constituting a supply chain attack or backdoor. It poses a significant security risk if used in production or untrusted environments.",
