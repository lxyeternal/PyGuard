{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to download and execute an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "URL in the requests.get() call that fetches an executable file from the internet.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call that executes the downloaded file, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code fetches a file from the internet (source) and immediately executes it via os.system (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and executing an external executable during package installation without user consent or verification. Hardcoded URL and filename. No verification of the downloaded file's integrity.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the 'install' command in setuptools. During installation, it downloads a specific executable from a hardcoded URL, saves it locally, and immediately executes it using os.system. This behavior is highly suspicious because it can run arbitrary code from the internet without user approval or verification, constituting a significant security risk. The use of requests to download a payload and then executing it directly constitutes malicious behavior, especially since the executable's purpose is unknown and it is fetched from a third-party URL. This pattern resembles malware behavior, such as downloading and executing malicious binaries during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation, which can be used to compromise systems. The pattern of automatically running downloaded code without verification indicates a supply chain attack vector or malicious intent.",
