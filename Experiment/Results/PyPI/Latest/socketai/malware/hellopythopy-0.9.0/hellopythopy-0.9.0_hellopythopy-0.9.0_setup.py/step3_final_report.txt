{
  "purpose": "The code overrides the 'install' command to download and execute an external executable during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "requests.get() call to fetch the executable from a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call to execute the downloaded file immediately after download.",
  "flows": "From the URL fetch via requests.get() to saving the file, then passing the filename to os.system() for execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unverified download and execution of an external executable during setup without user consent or verification; hardcoded URL; no error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads an executable from a hardcoded URL during installation, saves it as 'ins42.exe', and runs it immediately without verification. This pattern is characteristic of supply chain malware or backdoors. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and performs these actions silently, which is suspicious. The high severity of this behavior justifies malware and security risk scores close to 1. The behavior poses a severe threat, as it can introduce malicious payloads into systems during package installation. The scores in the reports are consistent with this analysis, and the behavior warrants a maximum threat level.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation without safeguards. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. It should be flagged as malicious, and the package should be reviewed or removed to prevent supply chain compromise.",
