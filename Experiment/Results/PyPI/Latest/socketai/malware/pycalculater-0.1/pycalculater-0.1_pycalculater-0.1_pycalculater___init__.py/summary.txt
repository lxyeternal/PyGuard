  "conclusion": "The code exhibits some suspicious features such as obfuscation and dynamic execution, but no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed. The current scores are generally appropriate; increasing the malware suspicion in reports 1 and 3 slightly improves accuracy. No further issues detected."
