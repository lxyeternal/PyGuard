  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic code execution (eval, exec), environment variables, external system calls, obfuscation patterns, hardcoded credentials.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system access, subprocess calls, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval or os.system leading to network or system commands, potentially with untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (0.7), dynamic code execution, unvalidated external calls, inconsistent security hygiene.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 correctly identifies suspicious features like eval and obfuscation, with scores reflecting moderate concern. The malware score of 0.3 is reasonable but could be slightly increased to 0.4 given the suspicious features. Report 2 shows benign code with no issues, scores are appropriate. Report 3 contains dynamic features with unvalidated inputs, scores are consistent; increasing malware to 0.3 could better reflect the suspicion. Reports 4 and 5 lack code or suspicious features, scores are appropriate. Overall, the scores align with the described code features, with minor adjustments to better reflect suspicion levels in reports 1 and 3.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits some suspicious features such as obfuscation and dynamic execution, but no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed. The current scores are generally appropriate; increasing the malware suspicion in reports 1 and 3 slightly improves accuracy. No further issues detected.",
