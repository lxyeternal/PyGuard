{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility module designed to handle configuration and data processing tasks, likely for a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, input parameters, and configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Data could be written to logs, output files, or sent over network connections; also, dynamic execution points if present.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or input sources flows through processing functions, potentially reaching output or network functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns detected. Use of dynamic evaluation or malicious imports is not apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration loading, environment variable access, and data handling routines. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or system manipulation are visible. The absence of obfuscation, malicious API calls, or unusual control flows supports benign intent. There are no hardcoded secrets or backdoors identified. Overall, the code appears to be a typical utility module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve normal utility functions within a larger application context.",
