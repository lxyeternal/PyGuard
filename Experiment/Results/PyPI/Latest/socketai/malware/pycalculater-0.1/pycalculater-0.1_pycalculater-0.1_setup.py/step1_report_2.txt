{
  "purpose": "The code appears to execute dynamically decoded and decompressed data, likely to run hidden or obfuscated malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "Input data is a base64-encoded, reversed string that is decompressed after being decoded, used as the argument for exec.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the dynamically decoded code, which is a potential sink for malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "The reversed, base64-decoded string is decompressed via zlib and then executed, forming a source-to-sink flow that runs obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code using lambda, base64, zlib, and string reversal to conceal payload. The payload itself is highly suspicious, likely malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a lambda function to reverse, base64 decode, and decompress input data. This payload is then executed via exec(). The obfuscation strongly suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent. There are no other external inputs or suspicious library calls apart from the obfuscation and dynamic execution. No clear benign functionality is visible. The code does not interact with environment variables, network, or file systems directly but relies entirely on dynamically executing hidden code, which is characteristic of malicious obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It employs obfuscation techniques to hide potentially harmful code that is executed at runtime. It should be treated as malicious behavior with a high malware score.",
