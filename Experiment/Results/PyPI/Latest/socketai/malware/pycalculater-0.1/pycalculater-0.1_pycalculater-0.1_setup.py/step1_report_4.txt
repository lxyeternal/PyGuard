{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated code that appears to execute dynamically decompressed and decoded payload.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the base64-encoded string, which is reversed before decoding.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executes the decompressed code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "Reversal of string -> base64 decoding -> zlib decompression -> execution via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code that reverses and decompresses data before executing; use of lambda for import and dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'zlib' and 'base64' modules dynamically using a lambda function. It then reverses a long base64-encoded string, decodes it, decompresses it, and executes the resulting payload. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent, as the actual payload is hidden and only revealed upon runtime deobfuscation. No other dependencies or external inputs are involved, but the payload's nature is entirely concealed until execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intentionally obfuscated and executes a decompressed payload, which is a common technique for hiding malicious code. Given the structure, use of dynamic import, string reversal, and execution of decompressed data, it likely contains malicious behavior. It is highly suspicious and potentially harmful.",
