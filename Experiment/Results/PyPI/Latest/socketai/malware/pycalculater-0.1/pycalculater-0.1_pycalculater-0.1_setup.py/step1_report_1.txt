{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated code executing dynamically decoded and decompressed payload, likely intended to perform hidden or malicious actions.",
  "sources": "Input data from a reverse string, base64 decoding, and zlib decompression embedded in a lambda function.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing dynamically decoded code, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "The code reverses a base64-encoded string, decodes and decompresses it, then executes the resulting payload via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated; the code uses string reversal, base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and dynamic execution, which are common obfuscation techniques. No readable or explicit logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a lambda function that, when called, imports zlib and base64 modules to decompress data obtained by decoding a base64 string reversed in order. The payload string is heavily obfuscated, suggesting an attempt to hide malicious intent. The payload is then executed directly via exec(), which is a major security concern as it can run arbitrary code. The use of such obfuscation and dynamic code execution typically indicates malicious activity or at least an attempt to conceal functionality. There are no other clear inputs or outputs, and the code does not interact with external sources directly aside from the decompression and execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It uses advanced obfuscation to hide its true purpose and executes dynamically decoded payload code. Such patterns are typical in malware or backdoored packages designed to perform unauthorized actions. Based on the analysis, the code poses a high security risk.",
