  "purpose": "Download and execute an external executable file from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "os.system call executing a shell command that runs curl to fetch a file from a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file using 'start' command, which can run the executable on the system.",
  "flows": "os.system executes curl command -> downloads 'howl.exe' from GitHub -> 'start' runs the downloaded executable.",
  "anomalies": "Direct execution of an executable fetched from an external source without verification; use of 'start' to run potentially unverified code; no validation or checksum for the downloaded file.",
  "analysis": "The code uses os.system to run a shell command that downloads an executable file from a GitHub URL using curl. After download, it immediately executes the file with 'start'. This pattern is often used to fetch and run malicious payloads, especially when there is no verification or validation of the downloaded file. The lack of any checksum validation or user prompt raises suspicion about the intent. The code does not perform any security checks, logging, or validation, making it potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by automatically downloading and executing an external executable without verification, which is a common tactic in malware distribution. It is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
