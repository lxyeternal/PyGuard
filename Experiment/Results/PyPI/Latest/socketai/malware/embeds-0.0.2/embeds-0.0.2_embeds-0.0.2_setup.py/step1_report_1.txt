  "purpose": "Define and configure the 'embeds' Python package for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata from hardcoded strings and the 'setuptools' import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data, network, or sensitive information are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the setup function uses static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls the setup() function with static package metadata. There are no dynamic inputs, environment variable manipulations, or suspicious code patterns. The purpose is to package the 'embeds' library, with no indications of malicious behavior or hidden functionality. The code is minimal and adheres to standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines package metadata for distribution.",
