  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could leak data or execute malicious commands.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code simply supplies package metadata to setuptools.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and follows standard packaging conventions. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with fixed parameters such as package name, version, author, description, and package list. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution occurs. The package metadata appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides package metadata for distribution.",
