  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal, standard Python `setup.py` script.\n   - It imports `setuptools` and calls `setup()` with static metadata:\n     ```python\n     from setuptools import setup\n\n     setup(\n       name=\"embeds\",\n       version=\"0.0.2\",\n       author=\"Lithium\",\n       description=\"Send embedded discord messages through your bot!\",\n       packages=[\"embeds\"]\n     )\n     ```\n   - No dynamic input, environment variables, network operations, or code execution is present.\n   - No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward, benign setup script.\n   - They note the absence of dynamic data, external inputs, network activity, or suspicious code.\n   - They assign high confidence (1.0 or close) that the code is standard and non-malicious.\n   - They all assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code content.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is justified; the script is a typical package setup with no security concerns.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all observations are factual.\n   - No anomalies, hidden payloads, or suspicious behaviors are reported or implied.\n\n5. **Any Recommendations for Score Adjustments?**\n   - The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard, non-malicious Python package setup script.\n   - The reports correctly assess the security posture.\n\n**Final Expert Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis above.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
