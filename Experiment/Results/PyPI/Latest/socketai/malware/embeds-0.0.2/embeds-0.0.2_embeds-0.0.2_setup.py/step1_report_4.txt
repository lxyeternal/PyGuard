  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'embeds' Python module, intended to distribute a library that sends embedded Discord messages through a bot.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; static package metadata defined within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; purely static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs detected. The code is straightforward and typical of a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static package metadata. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious payloads. The package appears to be a standard distribution configuration with no suspicious behavior. It does not include any code that interacts with the system or network at runtime. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a benign, standard Python package configuration with no malicious intent or security issues. It is a typical package setup file for distributing a Discord message bot library.",
