{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'embeds' Python package to be distributed via package managers.",
  "sources": "Input is from the 'setuptools' library import and the setup() function call with package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only specifies package metadata and does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to critical functions; the code only provides static package setup data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code; straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls setup() with static package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and packages. It does not include dynamic code execution, input processing, or network activity. The metadata appears typical for Python package distribution. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library named 'embeds.' There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks based on the provided content.",
