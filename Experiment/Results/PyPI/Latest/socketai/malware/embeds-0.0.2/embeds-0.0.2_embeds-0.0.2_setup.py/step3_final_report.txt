{
  "purpose": "The code is a minimal Python setup script used for packaging a module named 'embeds' with static metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from static package metadata defined within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script only defines package information without dynamic data or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static, hardcoded metadata. It contains no dynamic inputs, network activity, or code execution. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, standard packaging script. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
