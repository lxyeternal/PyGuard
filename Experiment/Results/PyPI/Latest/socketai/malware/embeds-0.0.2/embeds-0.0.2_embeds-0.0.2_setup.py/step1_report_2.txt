{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'embeds' intended for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and package list.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is used, executed, or sent over a network.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external input to critical functions or data sinks; the code only assigns static metadata values.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated elements. It uses standard setup from setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for packaging. It imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static metadata parameters. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The package appears to be a normal distribution script for a Discord messaging utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It serves only to package a Python project with static metadata.",
