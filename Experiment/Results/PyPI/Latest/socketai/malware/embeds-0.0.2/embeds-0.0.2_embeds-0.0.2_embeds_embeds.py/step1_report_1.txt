{
  "purpose": "Download and execute a remote file, potentially to run malicious code on the system.",
  "sources": "os.system call executing a curl command to fetch a file from a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via start command, potentially running malicious executable.",
  "flows": "os.system executes curl to download a file, then immediately runs the downloaded file, which could be malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Direct download and execution of a file from a suspicious URL without validation; use of 'start' to run a downloaded executable without any checks.",
  "analysis": "The code uses os.system to invoke curl, downloading an executable named 'howl.exe' from a GitHub raw URL. Immediately after download, it executes the file with 'start', which may run malicious code. There are no checks, validations, or safeguards. This pattern is characteristic of malicious activity, such as downloading and executing payloads without user consent or verification.",
  "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious and likely malicious, as it downloads and executes an external executable without validation. It resembles typical malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system.",
