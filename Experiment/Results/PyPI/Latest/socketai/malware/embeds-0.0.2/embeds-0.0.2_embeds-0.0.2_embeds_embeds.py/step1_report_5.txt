{
  "purpose": "Download and execute an executable file from a remote URL",
  "sources": "os.system call with a string containing a curl command",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via 'start' command",
  "flows": "os.system -> curl download -> saved file -> start executable",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with shell command; direct download and execution of a remote file without validation",
  "analysis": "The code uses os.system to invoke a shell command that downloads an executable file from a GitHub URL and then immediately executes it. This behavior bypasses security checks and could execute malicious code. The download URL points to a raw GitHub resource, which may be legitimate or malicious. The immediate execution without validation or integrity checks (such as hash verification) is risky and typical of malicious activity aiming to infect the host system. No input validation or error handling is present, increasing risk of unintended execution. The code shows no obfuscation but performs potentially malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script downloads and executes a potentially malicious executable directly from a remote source without validation, indicating high risk of malicious behavior. This pattern is commonly associated with malware delivery and system compromise.",
