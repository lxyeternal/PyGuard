  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Pyarmor runtime component used for code obfuscation and licensing enforcement. No evidence of malicious activity is present in static analysis. While the embedded payload could hide malicious code, there is no direct indication of such. The overall scores are appropriate, with low malware risk and high obfuscation, indicating a legitimate protection mechanism."
