  "purpose": "A setup.py script for packaging a Python library named 'sysfunc' with specified metadata.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields: name, version, packages, include_package_data, description, author, python_requires, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources; no external data or dynamic code; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration; no data flow or execution flow present.",
  "anomalies": "The 'python_requires' field set to '==3.13.*' is invalid syntax; this is a configuration error. The author name 'Hosne432' appears as a pseudonym but is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools, with static parameters and no dynamic or malicious code. The only notable anomaly is the invalid version specifier '==3.13.*', which could cause installation issues but does not constitute a security risk. No code injection, data leaks, or obfuscated code are present. The author name is not inherently suspicious. The malware score is correctly 0, as there is no malicious behavior. The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with straightforward code. The security risk score is very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting the configuration mistake rather than a security threat. Correcting the version specifier would improve compatibility but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with a minor syntax error in 'python_requires'. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code and poses no security threat. The only issue is the invalid version specifier, which should be corrected for proper package installation. Scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 to reflect the configuration mistake.",
