  "purpose": "Define and configure the package setup parameters for the 'sysfunc' Python library.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function such as package name, version, author, description, classifiers, and find_packages() for source code inclusion.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A – No dynamic data flow or untrusted input processing present.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual aspect: the python_requires pattern specifies '==3.13.*', which may be overly restrictive or potentially invalid, but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools, defining package metadata without any external input handling, dynamic code execution, or embedded secrets. The only unusual aspect is the specified Python version requirement which may not match actual available versions, but this does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py appears to be a standard package configuration script with no malicious behavior or security issues. The only minor concern is the strict Python version requirement, which could cause deployment issues but is not malicious.",
