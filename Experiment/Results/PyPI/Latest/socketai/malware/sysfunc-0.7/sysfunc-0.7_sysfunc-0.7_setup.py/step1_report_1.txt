{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'sysfunc' Python library.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from the setup parameters, the find_packages() function, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to data leakage or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the code primarily defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code detected. The author’s name 'Hosne432' appears to be a pseudonym or username, but this is not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard packaging modules and calls setup() with static parameters. The parameters specify package info such as name, version, packages, author, and classifiers. The use of find_packages() is common and does not indicate malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, external data reads, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a typical package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a standard, benign setup script for a Python package.",
