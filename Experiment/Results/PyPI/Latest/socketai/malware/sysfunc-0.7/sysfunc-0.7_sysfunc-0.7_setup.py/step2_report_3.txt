  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library.\n- The code uses static parameters, with no dynamic or untrusted data sources.\n- The only noted anomaly across multiple reports is the 'python_requires' parameter set to `'==3.13.*'`, which is invalid syntax because Python version specifiers do not support the '==' operator with wildcards like that. The correct syntax would be something like `'>=3.13,<3.14'` or `'==3.13.*'` (without quotes) if supported. However, this is a configuration error, not malicious code.\n- No reports identify any actual malicious behavior, such as code execution, external data handling, or embedded secrets.\n\n**Confirmations and discrepancies:**\n- The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious code.\n- The author name 'Hosne432' appears to be a pseudonym but is not suspicious per se.\n- No evidence of data leakage, external resource access, or code that could be exploited maliciously.\n- The only issue is the invalid version specifier, which could cause installation failures but does not pose a security risk.\n\n**Scores and their justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low or zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the script. The only minor concern is the invalid version specifier, but it does not constitute a security risk.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- The second report assigns a securityRisk of 0.1, citing the invalid version specifier as a configuration error. This is reasonable, but it should not be interpreted as a security risk.\n- The other reports assign 0 or very low scores, which is appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard packaging setup.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The only notable issue is the invalid 'python_requires' pattern, which should be corrected but is not malicious.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (since no actual security risk is present, only a configuration mistake)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe setup.py is a typical, benign package configuration script with a minor syntax issue in the 'python_requires' field. There are no indications of malicious behavior, and the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** After reviewing all reports, I concur with their assessments that the code is safe and non-malicious. The only adjustment I suggest is recognizing the invalid version specifier as a configuration error rather than a security concern.",
