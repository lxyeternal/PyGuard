  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ attribute from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for runtime protection or obfuscation handling.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs identified in this fragment",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates use of Pyarmor trial version, which is common for obfuscation purposes. The code is minimal and appears to be part of an obfuscated or protected package.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for __pyarmor__ from a local module. The comment references Pyarmor 9.0.6 trial, which is a tool used to obfuscate Python code. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or suspicious code constructs. The simplicity and context suggest this is part of a protected or obfuscated codebase. No suspicious data handling, external network activity, or malicious logic is present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be part of a protected or obfuscated package using Pyarmor. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet.",
