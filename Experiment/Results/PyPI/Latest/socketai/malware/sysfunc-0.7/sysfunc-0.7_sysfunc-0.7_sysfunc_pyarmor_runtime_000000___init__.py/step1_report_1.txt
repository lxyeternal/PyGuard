  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicates use of Pyarmor trial version, but this is a standard import statement with no malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a runtime component associated with Pyarmor, a known obfuscation tool. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious flows. The comment mentions trial details but does not affect the security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing a standard import for code protection. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
