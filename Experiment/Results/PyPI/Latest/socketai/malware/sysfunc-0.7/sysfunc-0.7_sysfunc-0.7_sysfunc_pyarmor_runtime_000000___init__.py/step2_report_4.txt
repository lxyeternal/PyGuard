  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code snippets, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports are about importing `__pyarmor__` from a local module `pyarmor_runtime`.\n- The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of import statements.\n- Comments indicate the use of Pyarmor trial versions, which is common in obfuscated or protected codebases.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious flows is present in any report.\n- The code's purpose appears to be related to code obfuscation or licensing enforcement, not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The actual code snippets are benign import statements.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n- The comments about Pyarmor trial versions are typical for obfuscated code, not indicators of malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No issues are present in the code itself.** The reports correctly identify the code as standard for obfuscated or protected scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and cautious, correctly noting the benign nature.\n- They assign low malware scores (mostly 0), which is appropriate.\n- Some reports assign a small obfuscated score (~0.2-0.8), reflecting the code's nature.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0 or 0.1, which seems reasonable given the context.\n\n**No significant logical flaws or mistakes are evident.** The reasoning aligns with the code snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware scores:** all are 0, which is justified.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** generally low to moderate, consistent with the code's minimal obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** mostly 0 or 0.1, appropriate for a benign import statement with obfuscation comments.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nThe scores seem reasonable; no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The code is a simple import statement, with comments about Pyarmor trial versions.\n- No malicious activity or suspicious logic justifies higher risk.\n\n---\n\n### Malware scores:\n- All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is related to obfuscation and licensing, which is accurate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or exploits are made; the analysis is cautious and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippets and reasoning.\n- No contradictions are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on all reports and the code snippets, my own estimates are:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                                      |\n|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious activity detected.                                      |\n| Obfuscated       | 0.2 - 0.3         | Minimal obfuscation, typical for protected codebases.               |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1               | Low risk due to the nature of the import and comments.              |\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, related to code obfuscation or licensing enforcement using Pyarmor. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. No changes needed.",
