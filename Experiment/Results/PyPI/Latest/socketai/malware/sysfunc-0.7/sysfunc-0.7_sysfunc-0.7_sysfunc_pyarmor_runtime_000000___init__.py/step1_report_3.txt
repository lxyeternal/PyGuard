  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or licensing purposes.",

  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Import statement from module to runtime usage (not explicitly shown)",
  "anomalies": "Presence of Pyarmor trial comment; no suspicious or malicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a runtime component related to Pyarmor, a known code obfuscation tool. The comment indicates it's a trial version. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling detected. The code is minimal and typical for obfuscated or protected Python scripts relying on external obfuscation tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard import of the Pyarmor runtime module, likely for obfuscation or licensing enforcement. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks identified.",
