{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ module from the local pyarmor_runtime package, likely for code obfuscation or runtime protection purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data processing or output functions present",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways observable in this minimal snippet",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a trial license comment, which may indicate obfuscation or license enforcement; no malicious code or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module related to Pyarmor, a known obfuscation and licensing tool for Python scripts. The comment mentions a trial version and a timestamp, but there is no actual executable logic, data handling, or network activity. The import suggests use of Pyarmor's runtime for protection, not malicious intent. The minimal nature of the code limits the scope of analysis, but nothing suspicious or malicious is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily serves to include a runtime module for code protection purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent based on this snippet.",
