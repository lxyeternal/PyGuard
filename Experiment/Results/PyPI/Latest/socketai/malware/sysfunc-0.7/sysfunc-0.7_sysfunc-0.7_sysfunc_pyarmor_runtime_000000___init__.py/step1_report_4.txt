{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for executing or managing obfuscated or protected Python code.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks identified",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates use of Pyarmor trial version with a specific expiration date; no suspicious or malicious code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a single import statement from a relative module. The comment references Pyarmor, a tool used for code obfuscation and licensing. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The import suggests runtime decryption or code protection, typical for obfuscated applications, but not malicious in itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard import statement related to Pyarmor's runtime environment, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
