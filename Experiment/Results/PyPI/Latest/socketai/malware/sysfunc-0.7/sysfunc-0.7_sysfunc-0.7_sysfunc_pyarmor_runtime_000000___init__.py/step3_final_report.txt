{
  "purpose": "Import of __pyarmor__ from the local module pyarmor_runtime, likely for code obfuscation or licensing enforcement.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Presence of comments indicating use of Pyarmor trial versions; minimal code structure; no malicious code or data flows",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement associated with Pyarmor, a known obfuscation tool. The comments suggest the use of trial versions, which is typical in protected codebases. No suspicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are detected. The import is standard for obfuscated or protected scripts. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated between 0.2 and 0.8, risk near 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The minimal code and comments do not indicate malicious intent. The obfuscation level varies depending on context but remains justified given the use of Pyarmor. Overall, the code is benign, and the scoring accurately reflects this.",
  "conclusion": "The code is part of a protected, obfuscated package using Pyarmor, with no malicious intent detected. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No changes are necessary.",
