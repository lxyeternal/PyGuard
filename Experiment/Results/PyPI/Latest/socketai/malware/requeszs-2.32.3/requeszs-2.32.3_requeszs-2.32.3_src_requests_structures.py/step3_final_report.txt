  "purpose": "Provides case-insensitive dictionary and lookup dictionary data structures used internally within the Requests library, primarily for handling HTTP headers and key-value data.",
  "sources": "Constructor methods (__init__), item access (__getitem__), update methods, and internal data storage (_store).",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; data remains within internal structures; no network or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through update and __setitem__ methods into internal storage; retrieval via __getitem__ and iteration.",
  "anomalies": "The copy() method in CaseInsensitiveDict returns OrderedDict(self._store.values()), which does not produce a proper copy of the object; this is a correctness issue, not a security concern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes for case-insensitive and lookup dictionaries, with standard implementations. No external data leaks, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The only minor flaw is in the copy() method, which may not behave as intended, but this does not impact security. The classes are used internally for handling headers and key-value data, with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of utility data structures with no malicious intent or security risks. The only issue is the implementation of the copy() method, which should be corrected for proper functionality, but this does not affect security. All security scores are appropriately set to zero.",
