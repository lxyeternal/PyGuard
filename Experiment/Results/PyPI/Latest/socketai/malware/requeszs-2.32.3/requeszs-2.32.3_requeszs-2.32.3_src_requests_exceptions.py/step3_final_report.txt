{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of exception classes for the Requests library, facilitating error handling for HTTP and connection-related issues.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines classes and imports from standard modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows involving untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows occur; the code is purely class definitions without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, inheriting from standard Python exceptions and imported modules. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. The structure is straightforward and follows standard patterns. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The import statements are from reputable modules, and the classes serve as error representations within the Requests library. The absence of data flows, external inputs, or executable code indicates a benign and standard implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The analysis and multiple reviews confirm its safety, and the scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
