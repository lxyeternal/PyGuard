{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors and warnings in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code imports exceptions from urllib3.exceptions and a compatibility layer from .compat, and uses them within class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only defines classes and inheritance structures without executing untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code follows standard exception class definitions and inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, including various HTTP and connection errors, with associated comments and inheritance from base Python exceptions and third-party exceptions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic. The code does not perform any input/output, network operations, or data processing; it purely establishes exception hierarchies. Import statements are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module defining exception classes for error handling within the Requests library. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
