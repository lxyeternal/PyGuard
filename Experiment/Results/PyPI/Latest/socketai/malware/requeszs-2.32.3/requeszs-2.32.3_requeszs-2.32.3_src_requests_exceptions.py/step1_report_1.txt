  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various request errors and warnings in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exceptions from urllib3 and compat modules, class constructors, and attribute checks.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input could influence exception handling, but no direct sinks for data leakage or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No evident flow from untrusted sources to sinks; exception classes are standard and used for control flow in the application.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code strictly defines exception classes without any suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling in the requests module. It imports necessary exception classes, defines subclasses for specific errors, and includes docstrings explaining their purpose. There are no external data inputs processed dynamically, no network connections established, nor any execution of untrusted code. The structure is typical for a Python exceptions module, with inheritance and method definitions aligned with standard practices. No indicators of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions for the Requests library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and it is unlikely to pose any security risks.",
