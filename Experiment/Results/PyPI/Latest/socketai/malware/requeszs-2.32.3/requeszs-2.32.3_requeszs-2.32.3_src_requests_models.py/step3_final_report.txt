{
  "purpose": "Embedded malicious code that downloads and executes an external payload, representing a supply chain attack or malware sabotage.",
  "sources": "The code executes immediately upon module load, specifically the base64-decoded URL and subprocess call to run the downloaded executable.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes the downloaded file, leading to remote code execution without user consent.",
  "flows": "The malicious code runs at module load, decoding base64 string -> downloading executable to TEMP directory -> executing the file with subprocess.Popen.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate execution of external code upon module load, use of environment variable for path, base64 obfuscation of URL, no legitimate connection to core library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a base64-encoded URL decoded at runtime, downloads an executable to a TEMP directory, and runs it detached from the process. This activity is outside the scope of normal library operation, indicating malicious intent. The rest of the code (Request, Response classes) appears standard and legitimate. The malicious snippet is embedded inline, executing immediately, which is typical for malware. The obfuscation via base64 suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=1, risk=1, obfuscation=0.8-1) are consistent with this activity.",
  "conclusion": "The embedded code is malicious, actively downloading and executing external malware. The rest of the code appears legitimate, but the malicious snippet constitutes a severe security breach. Immediate removal or thorough review is required.",
