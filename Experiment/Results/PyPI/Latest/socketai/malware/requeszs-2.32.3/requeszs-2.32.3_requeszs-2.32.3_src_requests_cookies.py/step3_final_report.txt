  "purpose": "Provides cookie management utilities for the requests library, including extraction, creation, deletion, and compatibility wrappers for cookie handling.",
  "sources": "Request objects (self._r), response headers (response._original_response.msg), input parameters for cookie creation and extraction functions.",
  "sinks": "Cookie extraction into CookieJar, header generation for requests, cookie deletion, cookie merging, and storage.",
  "flows": "Request object → MockRequest → Cookie extraction; Response headers → MockResponse → Cookie extraction; Cookie creation/update → CookieJar; CookieJar → Header string for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Uses standard threading locks and cookie handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie management functions, including extraction, creation, deletion, and merging of cookies, with compatibility wrappers. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The logic follows typical patterns for cookie handling in HTTP clients. The functions handle untrusted data as part of normal operation but do not introduce vulnerabilities beyond inherent cookie management risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, standard utility module for cookie management within the requests library. It performs expected functions without malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk score around 0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
