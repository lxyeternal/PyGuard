{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies with requests, including classes and functions to manage, create, and manipulate cookies and cookie jars.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal utils, standard libraries (calendar, copy, time, threading), and attributes from the requests.compat module. Reads request data in methods like get_type(), get_host(), and get_full_url().",
  "sinks": "Function extract_cookies_to_jar reads response headers; get_cookie_header retrieves cookie header; remove_cookie_by_name deletes cookies from jar; various methods access or modify cookie data and headers.",
  "flows": "Request data is used to generate mock request objects; response headers are extracted to populate cookie jars; cookie data is stored, retrieved, and updated through functions like set, get, and update; cookies are converted between different formats.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected. The code appears to be standard for cookie management. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. Use of threading lock is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements cookie handling and compatibility functions for requests and cookie jars, including classes for cookie storage, methods for cookie management, and utilities for converting cookies. It reads request URLs, headers, and response headers to extract and set cookies. No network connections, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The functions and classes follow typical patterns for cookie management without hidden or malicious logic. The only potential concern is that the code could be used maliciously if integrated into a malicious package, but by itself, it is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie management utilities for requests, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It serves to facilitate cookie handling in a safe manner, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
