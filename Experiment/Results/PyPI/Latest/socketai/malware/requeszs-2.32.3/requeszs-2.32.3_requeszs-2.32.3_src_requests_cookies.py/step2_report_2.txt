  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the utility functions/classes for cookie management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; cookies are extracted, stored, headers generated, and deletion possible.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity or obfuscation; standard cookie handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no malicious intent detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes compatibility utilities.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; functions for extracting, setting, and managing cookies.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or backdoors; standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; code appears safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning and scoring are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; standard cookie management functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; cookies extracted, headers generated, stored, and updated.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate; code is standard and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is sound and scoring justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; cookie utilities for requests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; from request/response to cookie jar and headers.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; standard cookie handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — fitting.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-founded and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; cookie management utilities.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly described; from request headers to cookie jars.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate; code is legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate and scoring appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, well-structured utility module for cookie management in the requests library.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, which is appropriate; no malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero but low, reflecting the potential for misuse if integrated maliciously, but no actual malicious behavior is evident.\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- The **malware scores** should remain at **0**, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated scores** should stay at **0**, since the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The **security risk scores** are low (around 0.1–0.2), which is reasonable given the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n**Estimated overall scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code appears safe and legitimate. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
