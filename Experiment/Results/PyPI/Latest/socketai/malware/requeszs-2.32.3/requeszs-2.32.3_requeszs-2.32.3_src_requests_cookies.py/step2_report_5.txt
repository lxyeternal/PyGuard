  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's functionality, potential vulnerabilities, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard cookie management utilities, reading from request and response objects.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookies are extracted, stored, and headers generated—typical behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no backdoors, no obfuscation. Uses standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate utility with high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity. The low security risk score is appropriate given the functions involved.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility utilities, standard request/response data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, creation, and management—routine.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious code; standard threading lock usage.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, safe code, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie utilities, similar to previous reports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header generation, cookie merging—standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, safe code, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is typical for cookie management, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie handling utilities, standard request/response interactions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header creation, storage—expected.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious features.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is routine and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie management utilities, standard data flows.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, storage, header generation—typical.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, safe code, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is standard for cookie handling.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's functionality—no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, standard implementation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1–0.2), reflecting typical cookie management utility risk.\n\n**Overall:** The code appears to be a legitimate, standard utility module for cookie management within the requests library. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present. The risk scores are appropriate given the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (confirmed safe)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, typical for such utilities)\n\nThis comprehensive review supports that the code is safe and standard, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
