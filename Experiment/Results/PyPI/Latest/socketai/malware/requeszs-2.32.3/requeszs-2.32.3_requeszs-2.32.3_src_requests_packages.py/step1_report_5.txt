  "purpose": "Maintain backwards compatibility by aliasing certain packages and modules to requests.packages namespace.",
  "sources": "sys.modules during iteration; imported packages ('urllib3', 'idna', 'chardet').",
  "sinks": "sys.modules assignment operations; dynamic module attribute manipulation.",
  "flows": "Imported packages are mapped into requests.packages namespace in sys.modules, preserving identity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic sys.modules manipulation to alias packages; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific packages ('urllib3', 'idna') and reassigns their module references into 'requests.packages' namespace to ensure compatibility across different environments. It also handles 'chardet' if available, similarly aliasing its modules. The logic involves iterating through sys.modules and reassigning module references, which is a common technique for maintaining backward compatibility. No external data input or untrusted data handling is present. There are no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be benign and aimed solely at ensuring legacy compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is intended for compatibility purposes, re-mapping modules into a different namespace without executing any malicious or harmful actions. No security threats or malware indications are identified.",
