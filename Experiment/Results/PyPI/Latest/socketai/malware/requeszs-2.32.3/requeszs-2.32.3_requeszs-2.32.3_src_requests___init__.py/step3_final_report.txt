  "purpose": "Dependency validation, environment setup, and warning configuration for the requests library to ensure compatibility and proper operation.",
  "sources": "Version strings of urllib3, chardet, charset_normalizer; import statements for dependencies; environment detection code.",
  "sinks": "Warnings issued based on version assertions; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Version strings are read during compatibility checks; warnings are triggered based on version assertions; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard dependency checks and environment configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency version assertions, environment compatibility checks, and warning setup routines. It imports dependencies, verifies their versions, and configures SSL fallback if needed. No malicious routines, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are present. The version assertions and warnings are typical for ensuring compatibility. The code is well-structured, clear, and intended for setup purposes, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup routine for the requests library, performing dependency checks and environment configuration without any malicious or suspicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by dependency assertions and environment modifications. The overall assessment confirms the code's benign nature.",
