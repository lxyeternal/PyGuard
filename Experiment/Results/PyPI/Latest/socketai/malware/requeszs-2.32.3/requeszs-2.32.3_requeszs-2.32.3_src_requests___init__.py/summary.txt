  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup routine for the requests library, performing dependency checks and environment configuration without any malicious or suspicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by dependency assertions and environment modifications. The overall assessment confirms the code's benign nature."
