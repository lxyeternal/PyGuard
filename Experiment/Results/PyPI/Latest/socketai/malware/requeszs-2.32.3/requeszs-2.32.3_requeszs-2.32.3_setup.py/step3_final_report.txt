{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup.py script for packaging the 'requests' Python library, managing dependencies, version checks, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__version__.py' via exec(), reads README.md, and command-line arguments for publishing.",
  "sinks": "Uses exec() to evaluate version file; calls os.system() for packaging commands during 'publish'.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument 'publish' triggers system commands; exec() executes code from version file during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to evaluate external version file; os.system() calls controlled by specific command-line argument; no network activity or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks with version validation and package info. The exec() call on '__version__.py' could execute malicious code if the file is compromised, but this is a common pattern. The os.system() commands are used for publishing and are triggered only with specific arguments, limiting potential misuse. No suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or malware signatures are present. The code structure is straightforward, and the risks are typical for such scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with minor security considerations due to the use of exec() and system calls. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a slight risk score around 0.2–0.3 due to exec() and system command usage.",
