{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'requests' Python library, including version checks and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info, command line arguments, and external files (__version__.py, README.md).",
  "sinks": "Uses os.system to run shell commands (potential risk if manipulated), exec to execute code from a file, and file reads that could be manipulated externally.",
  "flows": "Version check and message -> 'publish' command triggers shell commands -> reading __version__.py and README.md files -> setup() function gathers metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from an external file (__version__.py), which could be malicious if that file is tampered with. The os.system calls for publishing could be dangerous if manipulated, but are standard in setup scripts. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment validation, reads version info from an external file, and uses setup() for package configuration. The exec() function introduces potential risk if the __version__.py file is malicious. The os.system calls for publishing are standard but could be risky if the script is modified. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are detected. No obfuscated code or malware-like behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with a moderate concern due to the use of exec() on external data. No malicious intent or harmful behavior is evident. Risks are limited to potential tampering with external files and command execution, which are common in such scripts but should be secured.",
