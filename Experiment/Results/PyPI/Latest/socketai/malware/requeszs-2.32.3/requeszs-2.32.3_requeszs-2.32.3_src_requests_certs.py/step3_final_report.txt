  "purpose": "To output the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' and execution of 'print(where())' when run as main.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads a trusted resource path and prints it.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' -> execution of 'print(where())' -> output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted function from 'certifi' and prints its output when executed directly. It performs no data processing, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. All reports agree on its benign nature. The code is simple, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that reports the location of a trusted CA bundle. There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
