  "purpose": "The script outputs the default CA bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the certifi package's 'where' function to obtain the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "The output of the 'where()' function is printed to standard output.",
  "flows": "The code calls 'where()' as a source and prints the result as a sink, with no untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from certifi and prints its value when executed directly. The purpose is to reveal the path to the trusted CA bundle. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior observed. The code serves a simple informational purpose without performing any harmful actions or data manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and performs a standard operation of reporting the CA bundle location. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
