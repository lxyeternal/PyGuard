{
  "purpose": "The code provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the requests library, primarily for debugging or informational purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle path from the certifi package via the where() function.",
  "sinks": "The print() function outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "Source (certifi.where()) -> Output (print())",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a simple retrieval and display of a known, static resource.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package, then, if executed as the main program, prints the path to the CA bundle. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or handle sensitive information. The code is straightforward and appears to serve an informational purpose without any obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, providing the location of a trusted CA bundle without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a simple utility script with no indications of malicious behavior.",
