  "purpose": "Provide the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from the certifi package; executing 'where()' in the main block.",
  "sinks": "Printing the output of 'where()' to stdout.",
  "flows": "Import from certifi -> call 'where()' -> print result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of trusted certifi library.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the certifi library, which returns the path to the trusted CA bundle. When run directly, it prints this path. The code does not handle untrusted input, execute arbitrary code, or access sensitive data. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and reliance on a well-known, reputable library suggest no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that outputs the path to a trusted CA bundle. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
