{
  "purpose": "To provide the path to the default CA certificate bundle used for SSL verification in requests.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the CA bundle path via print(), which could be used by other processes or scripts.",
  "flows": "Import 'where' from 'certifi' -> Call 'where()' -> Print the result.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code constructs. The code is straightforward and only outputs the path to the CA bundle.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple utility that prints the location of the CA certificate bundle from the certifi package. It does not process untrusted input, perform network communication, or handle sensitive data. The code structure is standard, and the functions used are well-known and safe. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscation present. Its purpose is to assist in SSL certificate verification configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily serving as a utility to output the CA bundle path. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
