  "purpose": "Return the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The certifi.where() function call which retrieves the path to the CA bundle.",
  "sinks": "The print() function outputs the CA bundle path; no untrusted data processing or storage occurs.",
  "flows": "The code calls certifi.where() and directly prints the result; data flows from certifi package to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for CA bundle retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the certifi package and prints its return value when executed as the main program. It serves a simple utility purpose of displaying the CA bundle path. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No external network connections or data processing occur beyond retrieving a trusted CA bundle path. The code appears to be a standard utility script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility to display the CA bundle location. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
