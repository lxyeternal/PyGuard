{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility and utility functions for handling imports, version detection, character detection, and standard library abstractions across different Python versions and environments.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module, sys.version_info, urllib3.__version__, dynamic import attempts for 'chardet' and 'simplejson', standard library modules (collections, http, io, urllib).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code performs standard library imports, version checks, and dynamic module loading without executing untrusted data or executing code from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, detecting versions, dynamically importing optional modules, and defining compatibility variables, with no untrusted data input or code execution from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; the code appears straightforward for compatibility purposes and standard library handling.",
  "analysis": "The script performs version checks, attempts to import optional modules ('chardet' and 'simplejson') with fallback mechanisms, and defines compatibility variables for Python 2 and 3. It imports standard modules and assigns variables accordingly. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The logic is typical for a compatibility layer and contains no external data handling or security-critical operations. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly manages imports and version detection, with no external data processing or harmful behavior.",
