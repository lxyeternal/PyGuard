{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling different Python versions and package dependencies, primarily for backward compatibility and import resolution.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (importlib, sys, urllib3, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request), dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', conditional import of 'simplejson' or 'json'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present. The code primarily loads modules and assigns variables based on imports and version checks.",
  "flows": "Import statements and module resolution flow, with some conditional logic for optional dependencies and version detection, but no flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The code is straightforward, focusing on compatibility and environment detection. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard environment detection, version checks, and conditional imports, typical for compatibility modules. It attempts to import optional dependencies ('chardet', 'simplejson') safely, without executing untrusted code. No obfuscated language features or suspicious patterns are present. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication. The logic is consistent with a compatibility layer, and the code does not interact with untrusted data sources or perform harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs environment detection and imports necessary modules without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
