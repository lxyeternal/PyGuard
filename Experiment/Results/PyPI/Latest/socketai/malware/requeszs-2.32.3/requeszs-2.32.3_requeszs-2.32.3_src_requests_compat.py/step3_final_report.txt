{
  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility module for handling import compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3, and managing optional dependencies like 'chardet' and 'simplejson'.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as 'importlib', 'sys', 'urllib3', 'collections', 'http', 'io', 'urllib.parse', 'urllib.request', and optional modules 'chardet', 'charset_normalizer', 'simplejson'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no sinks related to data leaks, network activity, or code execution are present.",
  "flows": "The code performs environment detection and conditional imports without executing untrusted code or handling untrusted input, so no source-to-sink data flows exist.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard import and compatibility handling, no obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, performing version detection, optional module resolution, and defining environment variables. It does not process untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. The import statements and version checks are standard practices. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are evident. The code's structure is clear and intended solely for environment compatibility, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
