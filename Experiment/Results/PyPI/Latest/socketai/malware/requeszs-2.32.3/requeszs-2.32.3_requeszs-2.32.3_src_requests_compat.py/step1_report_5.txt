{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as supporting various libraries for character detection, JSON parsing, and URL handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (importlib, sys, collections, http, io, urllib, and json modules). Function calls for version detection and optional module imports. No user input or external data sources are directly accessed.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks or output points present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code performs static imports and version checks; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious logic, or unusual code patterns are present. The code primarily handles compatibility and module imports without performing any complex operations or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a descriptive comment about its purpose. It imports necessary modules, performs version detection, and conditionally imports optional libraries such as 'simplejson' and character detection libraries. The code sets compatibility flags for Python versions and defines some standard types. There is no handling of user input, network access, or data manipulation that could be malicious. The structure is straightforward, primarily for compatibility support, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility and import utility module with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It serves as a helper module for broader projects and does not perform any harmful actions.",
