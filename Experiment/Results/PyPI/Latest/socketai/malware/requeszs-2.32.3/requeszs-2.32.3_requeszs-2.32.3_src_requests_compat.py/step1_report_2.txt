{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling different Python versions and library dependencies, mainly for internal use within a larger package.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module(lib), import statements (simplejson, json, collections, http, io, urllib), sys.version_info, urllib3.__version__",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input from external modules or environment variables, but primarily these are static imports and version checks",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to critical sinks; the code mainly performs compatibility checks and imports",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; all operations are standard compatibility and import handling procedures",
  "analysis": "The code performs version detection, dynamic imports, and compatibility handling without executing any untrusted code or performing actions that could lead to security vulnerabilities. It dynamically resolves character detection libraries and JSON handling modules, which are standard practices. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or suspicious data flows. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical compatibility layers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility module with no signs of malicious behavior. It functions as intended for managing imports and Python version differences without introducing security risks.",
