{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling different Python versions and HTTP-related operations, including character detection, JSON parsing, and URL handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements (importlib, sys, urllib3, simplejson, json, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request) and internal function _resolve_char_detection() that attempts to import 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not process untrusted data directly, nor does it write or transmit data outside standard library functions.",
  "flows": "N/A. The code primarily imports modules, detects environment capabilities, and defines variables, with no active data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or malicious patterns. It performs standard compatibility checks, module imports, and version detections. The redefinition of 'str' and 'bytes' is typical for compatibility but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment and version detection, conditionally imports modules, and defines compatibility variables. The function _resolve_char_detection() attempts to import popular character detection libraries, which is standard. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data is present. There are no hardcoded secrets or anomalies indicating malicious intent. The code appears to be a benign compatibility layer for Python and HTTP handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility and utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily deals with importing standard libraries and setting up compatibility variables.",
