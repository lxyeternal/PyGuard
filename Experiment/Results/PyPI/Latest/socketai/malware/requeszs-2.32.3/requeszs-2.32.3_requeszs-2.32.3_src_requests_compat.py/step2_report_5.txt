  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a compatibility layer handling imports, version detection, and optional dependencies.\n- It does not process untrusted data, execute code dynamically from untrusted sources, or perform network operations.\n- The code appears standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **Presence of all reported modules and functions:** The code matches the descriptions.\n- **No malicious patterns:** No code execution from untrusted sources, no network activity, no data exfiltration.\n- **Compatibility handling:** Standard practices, no anomalies.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n\n- **Accuracy of the analysis:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a compatibility layer with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Potential overestimations:** No overestimations are evident.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate; no flaws are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Score suggestions:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since no security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n**Any higher scores would be unjustified.**\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the code features justify a higher risk score. It’s a compatibility module, standard in many projects, with no malicious or security-critical operations.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- **Potential assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Malware detection:** No malicious activity is present; scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Score Type        | Suggested Value | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                 | Clear, straightforward code.                                |\n| Security Risk     | 0                 | No vulnerabilities or risky operations.                      |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign compatibility layer.\n- All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity.\n- Scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
