{
  "purpose": "Define metadata attributes for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and other metadata.",
  "sources": "None; the code only assigns string and numeric literals to module-level variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art comment; no suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata variable assignments for the 'requests' package, which is a widely-used HTTP library. The variables contain static strings, version info, author info, and license data. The ASCII art comment at the top is benign and does not affect execution. There are no input/output operations, no data manipulation, and no external calls or dynamic code execution. Overall, the code is straightforward and standard for package metadata definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign metadata declaration for the 'requests' Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It serves purely informational purposes within the package's source.",
