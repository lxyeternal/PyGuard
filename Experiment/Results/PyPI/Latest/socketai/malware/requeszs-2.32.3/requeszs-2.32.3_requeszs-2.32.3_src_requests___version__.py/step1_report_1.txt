  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and consistent with standard package metadata definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of static variable assignments providing metadata about the 'requests' library. There are no input reading, data processing, or untrusted data flows. The content appears typical for package setup or metadata files. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as metadata definitions for the package. No malicious or suspicious elements are present.",
