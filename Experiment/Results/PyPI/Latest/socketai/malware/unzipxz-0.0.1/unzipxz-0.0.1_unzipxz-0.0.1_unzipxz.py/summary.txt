  "security_risk": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious activity, such as obfuscation and potential data exfiltration. While not definitively malicious on its own, the indicators justify high suspicion. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and the overall security risk is high if used in an untrusted environment."
