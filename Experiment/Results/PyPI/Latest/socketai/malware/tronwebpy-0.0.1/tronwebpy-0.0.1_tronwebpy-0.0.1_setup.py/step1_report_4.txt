{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python library called 'tronwebpy'.",
  "sources": "The script reads the README.md file for long_description, and uses setup() parameters for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; the script mainly defines package configuration.",
  "flows": "The script reads the README.md file (source) and uses it for package description; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or unusual code structures; dependencies are standard; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard packaging modules, reads a README file, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The dependencies and URLs are typical for a Python package. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident in the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
