  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'tronwebpy' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file from the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; dependencies and metadata are static.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content as long_description; no untrusted data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic. Use of standard setup tools and straightforward configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and repository URL. There are no dynamic inputs, external commands, or suspicious code patterns present. All dependencies are standard and safe, and no sensitive information or malicious code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate package configuration code.",
