  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'tronwebpy', defining metadata, dependencies, and project info.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, file writes, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setup tools, reads a local README.md, and defines package metadata, dependencies, author info, and project URL. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or untrusted data flows. The code is static, well-structured, and follows standard practices. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. All signals indicate benign intent. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior. Confidence is high (1) due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as they are. No further security concerns are identified.",
