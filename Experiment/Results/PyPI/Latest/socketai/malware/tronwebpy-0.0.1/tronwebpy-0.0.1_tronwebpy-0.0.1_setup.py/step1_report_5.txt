  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the Python package 'tronwebpy', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or malicious activity; dependencies and metadata are static.",
  "flows": "Reading file content into long_description, passing static arguments into setup().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It reads the README.md file to include a long description and specifies package details such as name, version, author info, dependencies, and repository URL. There are no dynamic inputs, no suspicious or obfuscated code, and no external data sources besides static files and hardcoded strings. The dependencies listed are standard ('requests') and there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
