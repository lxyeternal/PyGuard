  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'tronwebpy' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no code executing untrusted input or network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code only reads static files and sets up package metadata; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations: importing modules, reading a README file, and defining package metadata. The dependencies are fixed ('requests') and there are no user inputs or dynamic code execution. The source is reading a local README file, and the only sink is the setup process itself, which is safe. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
