  "purpose": "Import the 'tronwebpy' object or module from the local 'main' package/module.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module or package within the project.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "Imports 'tronwebpy' from '.main', which could be used elsewhere in the project.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code only imports a component without any additional logic or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of 'tronwebpy' from a local module 'main'. There are no embedded or embedded suspicious behaviors, no data manipulation, and no network activity. The simplicity indicates no immediate signs of malicious intent. However, without seeing the contents of 'main.py' or the context of 'tronwebpy', it cannot be fully assessed if that object/module contains malicious code. Based solely on this snippet, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement with no visible malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or other potentially suspicious operations. The overall risk appears low, but full assessment depends on the contents of 'main.py' and 'tronwebpy'.",
