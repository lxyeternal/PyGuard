  "purpose": "Import the 'tronwebpy' object or module from the local 'main' package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'main' module and attempts to import 'tronwebpy' from it.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this single import statement; no untrusted data processing or output occurs here.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the import statement to the usage of 'tronwebpy' elsewhere (not shown), but within this snippet, no data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple relative import with no apparent anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward relative import of 'tronwebpy' from the local 'main' module/package. This is a common Python practice and does not, by itself, indicate malicious behavior. Without additional context or usage, there's no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The minimal snippet provides no signs of data leakage, insecure operations, or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe based solely on this code fragment.",
