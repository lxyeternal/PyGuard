  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a simple import statement.\n- No embedded malicious behavior, data flow, or anomalies.\n- The risk score is 0.2, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Malware score is 0, which is consistent.\n- Confidence is 0.6, reflecting moderate certainty due to lack of context.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The import itself is benign, but full assessment depends on 'main.py' and 'tronwebpy'. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Recognizes that importing 'tronwebpy' from 'main' could execute code within that module.\n- Highlights that if 'main.tronwebpy' is malicious, import can trigger malicious code execution.\n- The report assigns a low to moderate risk (0.2) and malware score 0, assuming no evidence of malicious code in the import statement itself.\n- Confidence is 0.4, indicating some uncertainty due to lack of inspection of 'main.tronwebpy'.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is cautious and appropriate. The risk score is low, but the potential for malicious code exists if 'main.tronwebpy' is compromised. Given only the import line, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Notes that the import is standard and harmless.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- Assigns maximum confidence (1) and zero malware or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The import is benign, and the reasoning is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous, emphasizes the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n- No anomalies or malware indications.\n- Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Again, a straightforward import with no signs of malicious activity.\n- No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- Confidence is 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple import statement.\n- The primary concern is the trustworthiness of 'main.tronwebpy', which cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the lack of malicious code in the import statement itself.\n- The risk scores are low, reflecting minimal immediate risk but acknowledging that malicious code could reside within 'main.tronwebpy'.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0, since the code itself shows no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 to 0.3, considering the dependency on the trustworthiness of 'main.tronwebpy'.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet is benign on its own. The main risk depends on the contents of 'main.py' and 'tronwebpy'. Without further context, the current scores are reasonable. I would maintain the malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and set the overall risk score around 0.2, reflecting a low but non-zero potential risk if the imported module is malicious.\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways review the contents of imported modules, especially in supply chain contexts, to ensure they are trustworthy.",
