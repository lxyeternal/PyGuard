{
  "purpose": "Import the 'tronwebpy' object or module from the local 'main' package, likely to utilize its functionality in the current context.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'main' package/module in the local directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; it does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing 'tronwebpy' from 'main', with no further data or control flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import, which by itself does not execute any malicious or insecure behavior. The security implications depend entirely on the contents of 'main.py' and the 'tronwebpy' object/module. Since no additional logic, data handling, or network activity is present, the code is benign. The malware score remains at 0, and the risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), assuming the imported module is from a trusted source. Without inspecting 'main.py' or 'tronwebpy', we cannot definitively assess their trustworthiness, but the import statement itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate given the minimal code. The primary concern should be verifying the trustworthiness of the 'main' package and 'tronwebpy' object/module, which is outside the scope of this snippet.",
