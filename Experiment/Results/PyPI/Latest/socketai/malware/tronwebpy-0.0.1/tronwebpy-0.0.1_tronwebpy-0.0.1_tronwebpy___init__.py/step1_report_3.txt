{
  "purpose": "Importing the 'tronwebpy' component from the local 'main' module, likely to provide blockchain-related functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module file, 'main.py' or 'main/__init__.py'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no functions or code executing untrusted input or external resources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; only an import statement is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement, which is standard and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'tronwebpy' from a relative module 'main'. There are no operations, no input handling, and no execution of external code. It appears to be part of a larger project, and this line alone does not pose any security risk or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement without any malicious intent. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The code's purpose is likely to include blockchain functionality from the 'main' module.",
