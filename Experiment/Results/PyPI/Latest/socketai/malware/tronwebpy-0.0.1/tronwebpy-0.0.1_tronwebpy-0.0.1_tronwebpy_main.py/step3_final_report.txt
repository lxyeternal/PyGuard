  "purpose": "Send private key via POST request and retrieve switcher status to determine function output.",
  "sources": "Input: private_key parameter; Data read from external URLs via requests.get and requests.post.",
  "sinks": "External network endpoints where private_key data is transmitted; switcher response used to control return value.",
  "flows": "private_key is included in transaction_data (intended as a dict, but code uses a set), sent via POST; switcher URL is fetched via GET; response influences function output.",
  "anomalies": "transaction_data constructed as a set with a string and variable, which is invalid syntax; typo 'ptivat_key' suggests careless coding or obfuscation; private key sent in plaintext over network; URLs are suspicious; no encryption or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to exfiltrate a private key by sending it over an insecure network request, using an improper data structure (set instead of dict), which indicates either a coding mistake or obfuscation. The plaintext transmission of sensitive data is a security risk. The repeated typo 'ptivat_key' and the suspicious URL endpoints further suggest malicious intent or careless handling. The high malware score (0.75) and security risk score (0.85) are justified given the potential for data theft. The low obfuscation score (0.2) reflects the straightforward but flawed implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high security risk due to insecure private key exfiltration, with signs of poor coding or obfuscation. It should be considered malicious or highly insecure, warranting high malware and risk scores. The issues identified are consistent across reports, and scores are justified.",
