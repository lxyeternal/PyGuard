{
  "purpose": "Generate a JavaScript file embedding JSON data and prepare data for visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads input data (json_dump), external functions for data fetching and processing.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to a file '%s.js', potentially exposing data if external functions are malicious.",
  "flows": "json_dump is concatenated into a JS variable; external data functions fetch data; data is visualized.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code related to HTML manipulation; use of open() without context managers; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code writes JSON data into a JS file, fetches Binance data, and creates plots. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External functions are assumed legitimate. Commented code is inactive. The file operations are straightforward, and no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are evident. The code's purpose appears benign, focused on data serialization and visualization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated components. The low security risk scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
