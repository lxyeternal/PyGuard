  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard blockchain data retrieval, database storage, and testing mocks.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious data flows, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with standard practices. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar data collection and storage, with external API data saved to a file.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no secrets, standard mocking.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate data collection utility, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Blockchain data, external API, and file storage.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation. Use of lambda functions to override close/rollback could be slightly unusual but is typical in test setups.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard testing infrastructure, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar data collection, database, and API interactions.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No secrets or malicious code. Use of regex and mocking is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are fine.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Blockchain data, API, and database interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `sys.exit()` without import, potential lack of response validation, but these are minor issues and not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Overall, the code is standard for data collection and testing. No signs of malware or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity detected; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0.1, generally around 0.2, reflecting minor potential issues like missing imports or lack of response validation but nothing severe.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, mainly due to minor code issues, not malicious intent)\n\n**Overall:** The code appears to be standard blockchain data collection, testing infrastructure, and API interaction code, with no signs of malicious behavior or significant security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The scores are consistent across reports and justified by the detailed analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
