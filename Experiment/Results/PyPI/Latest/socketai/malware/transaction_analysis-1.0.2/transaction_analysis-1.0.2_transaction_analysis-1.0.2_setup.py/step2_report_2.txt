  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the original code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:  \n   The original code is a typical `setup.py` script using `setuptools`. It defines package metadata (`name`, `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`) and dependencies (`install_requires`, `extras_require`).  \n   - **Presence of issues?** No. The code is straightforward and static.  \n   - **Malicious code or anomalies?** No. The license field is set to \"Python Script,\" which is unconventional but not malicious.  \n   - **Obfuscation?** No. The code is clear and standard.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Report**:  \n   All five reports agree that the code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent, no dynamic code, no external input, and no suspicious behavior. They mention the unusual license value but correctly identify it as non-malicious.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware Score (all reports):** 0.0 — consistent with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — no obfuscation present.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** 0.0 — no vulnerabilities or risks identified.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns**:  \n   - The only minor anomaly is the license field being \"Python Script.\" While unconventional, it does not introduce any security risk or malicious behavior.  \n   - No evidence of supply chain attack vectors, such as malicious dependencies, code injection, or hidden payloads.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:  \n   - The code is a typical, benign package setup script.  \n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.  \n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0.0**.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0.0**.  \n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at **0.0**.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is straightforward in its purpose. The only minor point is the unconventional license string, which does not impact security.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the overall consensus that the code is benign and standard.",
