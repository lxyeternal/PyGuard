  "purpose": "This setup.py script defines package metadata and dependencies for the 'transaction_analysis' Python package, facilitating its distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Static code defining package info; no external input or runtime data flows.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional 'license' value set to 'Python Script', but this is not malicious or risky.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, external input, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The only anomaly is the license string, which does not impact security. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriately zero across malware, obfuscation, and overall risk. The unconventional license string does not affect security. All evidence supports a safe, standard configuration.",
