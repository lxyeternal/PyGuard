  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; configuration data is static and hardcoded, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "License is specified as 'Python Script' which is unusual; typically a license file or standard license identifier is used. No malicious code or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no suspicious or malicious code present. Dependencies are standard, and no sensitive data or hardcoded secrets are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and aligns with standard practices.",
