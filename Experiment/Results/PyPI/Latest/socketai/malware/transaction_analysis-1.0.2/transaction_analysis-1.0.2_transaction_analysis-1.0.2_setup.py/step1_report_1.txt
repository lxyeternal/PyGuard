  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for 'transaction_analysis' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static source code defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; no external data input or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static configuration for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. License field set to 'Python Script' which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. It specifies metadata such as name, version, description, author, license, packages, and dependencies. The 'install_requires' and 'extras_require' define dependencies, with no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or unusual constructs were found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
