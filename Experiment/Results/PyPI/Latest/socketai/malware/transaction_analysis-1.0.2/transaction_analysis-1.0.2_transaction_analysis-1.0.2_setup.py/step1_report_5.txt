{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup parameters for the 'transaction_analysis' Python package.",
  "sources": "Code reads static string values for package metadata, such as name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no external input or data output is occurring.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard setuptools setup pattern. The license value 'Python Script' is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools to package a Python project named 'transaction_analysis'. It specifies package metadata and dependencies, including a normal version specifier for 'blessings'. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The license field value 'Python Script' is unconventional but not inherently malicious. No input/output operations, network activity, or code execution from untrusted sources are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
