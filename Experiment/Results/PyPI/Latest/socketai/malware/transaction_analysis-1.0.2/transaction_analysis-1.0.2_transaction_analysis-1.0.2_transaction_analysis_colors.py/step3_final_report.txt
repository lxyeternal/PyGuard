  "purpose": "Determine terminal color output setup based on OS detection",
  "sources": "sys.platform, platform.platform(), platform.version()",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; only environment detection and output formatting",
  "flows": "OS detection → color variable assignment → terminal output formatting",
  "anomalies": "Unnecessary check for 'ios' in OS detection; reliance on platform.version() format",
  "analysis": "The code detects the OS platform and version to decide whether to enable colored terminal output. It disables colors on Windows, macOS, and iOS, and enables ANSI sequences on Windows 10 versions >= 10586 using os.system(''). Color variables are set accordingly. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The logic is straightforward, with minor redundancy in OS detection. No obfuscation or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily OS detection and terminal formatting. No malicious or security issues are present. The code's approach is standard and safe.",
