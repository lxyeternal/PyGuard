  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior, including heavy obfuscation, dynamic network communication, and potential data exfiltration. The high scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate. It should be treated as malicious and handled accordingly—blocked, further analyzed, or removed."
