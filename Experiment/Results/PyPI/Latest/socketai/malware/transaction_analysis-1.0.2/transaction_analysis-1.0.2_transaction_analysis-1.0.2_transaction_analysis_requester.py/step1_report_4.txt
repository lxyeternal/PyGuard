{
  "purpose": "The code monitors a list of cryptocurrency wallets for balance changes and new transactions, logging updates and playing a sound alert.",
  "sources": "The code reads wallet addresses and metadata from the 'wallets' list, reads and writes to a specified filename, and fetches data from the blockchain.info API using requests.get().",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the requests.get() function (network request), file.write() (writing logs), and winsound.PlaySound() (playing a sound file).",
  "flows": "Input data (wallets list and filename) → API request to blockchain.info → JSON response processing → detecting balance/transaction changes → logging and alerting → sound playback.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes an unused function 'requester' which constructs a URL with unvalidated input but is not called. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data are present. The use of external sound files and infinite loop with sleep is standard for monitoring scripts. No obfuscated code or malicious obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script continuously monitors specified wallets by polling the blockchain.info API every 60 seconds. It detects balance changes and new transactions, logs these events, and plays a sound alert. It handles exceptions during network requests gracefully. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, command execution, or access sensitive information beyond reading wallet data and writing logs. The unused 'requester' function is harmless but redundant. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign wallet monitoring script with standard logging and alert features. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The overall security risk is minimal, with no security threats identified.",
