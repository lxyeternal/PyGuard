{
  "purpose": "The code monitors specified Bitcoin wallet addresses for balance changes and new transactions, logging these events and alerting via console and sound notifications.",
  "sources": "Requests data from external API at 'https://blockchain.info/rawaddr/' using user-provided wallet addresses.",
  "sinks": "Writes logs to a specified file, plays sound notifications, and outputs to console.",
  "flows": "Wallet addresses are used to construct API requests (source), responses are parsed for transaction data (sink), which triggers notifications and logs (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Uses an infinite loop with a fixed sleep interval; no apparent input validation for wallet data; no rate limiting or retry logic; the 'requester' function concatenates URL without sanitization but is not used elsewhere; minimal error handling, only logs exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code continually polls blockchain.info API for specified wallet addresses, tracking balance and transactions. It manages a processed transactions set to avoid duplicates. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injections. The only notable behavior is persistent polling and local file logging with alert sounds, which are typical for monitoring tools. The 'requester' function is defined but not used; no hidden or obfuscated code present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity detected. The use of external requests is standard, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a wallet monitoring script with no malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs standard API polling and local logging, with no suspicious or malicious activities observed.",
