{
  "purpose": "Monitor specified cryptocurrency wallets for balance changes and transactions, log updates, and alert the user via sound notifications.",
  "sources": "Wallet data from the provided list; API responses from blockchain.info; local file for logging; system time for timestamp comparisons.",
  "sinks": "Console output for alerts; log file for persistent records; winsound.PlaySound for audio notifications.",
  "flows": "Wallet addresses are used to construct API requests; responses are parsed to detect balance/transaction changes; alerts and logs are generated based on new data; processed transactions are tracked to avoid duplicates.",
  "anomalies": "The set 'processed_transactions' is re-initialized each loop, causing potential reprocessing of transactions; missing imports ('time', 'datetime', 'winsound') and undefined variables ('GREEN', 'RED', 'ENDC') lead to runtime errors; URL construction in 'requester' function insecure if used with untrusted input, though not utilized in main code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard wallet monitoring by polling blockchain.info for each wallet, detecting balance and transaction changes, and alerting the user. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The main security concerns are coding oversights: missing imports, undefined variables, and the re-initialization of the 'processed_transactions' set each cycle, which can cause duplicate processing. The 'requester' function constructs URLs insecurely but is unused, posing minimal risk. Overall, the code's behavior is benign, with a low security risk score justified by operational issues rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign wallet monitoring tool with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The primary issues are coding oversights that could lead to runtime errors or inefficiencies but do not introduce security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minor code quality concerns.",
