  "conclusion": "The code does not contain explicit malware or malicious payloads but exhibits significant security and privacy risks due to hardcoded secrets, unvalidated user inputs, and insecure data transmission. The overall malware score is 0, but the security risk is moderate (around 0.6). It warrants caution and remediation to mitigate privacy and secret exposure issues."
