  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, considering the code, the described issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** Highlights hardcoded Telegram token, data transmission to external IP and AI services, and unvalidated user inputs. Concludes moderate security risk (0.6), malware score 0, obfuscated 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the security risks associated with hardcoded secrets and unvalidated data flows. No malware or malicious payloads are evident. The risk score of 0.6 seems reasonable given the privacy and credential exposure.\n\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed; the reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Emphasizes suspicious behavior due to hardcoded credentials, external data collection, potential privacy invasion, and data exfiltration. Malware score 0.75, security risk 0.8.\n\n- **Assessment:** The high malware and security risk scores are justified because the code transmits user data and IP info externally, with hardcoded secrets, indicating privacy invasion and potential misuse. The analysis considers the possibility of malicious intent but finds no explicit malicious payloads.\n\n- **Recommendation:** The malware score could be slightly lowered if there's no evidence of actual malicious payloads, but given the privacy invasion and hardcoded secrets, 0.75 remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to others—external API calls, hardcoded tokens, no validation, potential data leakage. Malware score 0, risk 0.3.\n\n- **Assessment:** The low malware score is appropriate; no malicious code or payloads are present. The low security risk score reflects the absence of overt malicious activity.\n\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Focuses on external API interactions, embedded credentials, and data transmission without encryption. Malware score 0.2, risk 0.6.\n\n- **Assessment:** The malware score is low; no malicious code or backdoors are indicated. The moderate risk stems from credentials exposure and data handling issues, which is reasonable.\n\n- **Recommendation:** The malware score could remain at 0, as no malware or malicious code is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to others—external API calls, hardcoded tokens, data leakage potential. Malware score 0, risk 0.4.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments; no malicious payloads are evident. The risk is moderate due to credentials and data handling.\n\n- **Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports are consistent with no explicit malware present. The highest malware suspicion was 0.75 (Report 2), justified by the privacy invasion and data exfiltration potential, but no actual malicious payloads are identified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly indicate 0; no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Varies from 0.3 to 0.8, mostly driven by credential exposure and data privacy concerns. Given the code's behavior, a moderate risk (around 0.5-0.6) is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n*Justification:* No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or sabotage.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n*Justification:* Code is clear, straightforward.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.55**  \n*Justification:* The main concern is privacy invasion due to hardcoded secrets and unvalidated data flows, but no active malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and appropriately assess the security posture. The primary concern is privacy and credential exposure rather than malware. The scores reflect this accurately.",
