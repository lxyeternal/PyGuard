  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'spiderxr_ai'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'README.md' file to generate the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present. No output or data transmission based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The file reads static package metadata and content from 'README.md', with no flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a standard setup script with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for packaging a Python project. It imports 'setuptools' functions, defines package metadata, and reads a local README file for the long description. No dynamic code execution, no external data inputs besides the static file read, and no sensitive data hardcoded beyond standard package info. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code injection are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign Python package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
