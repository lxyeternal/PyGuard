  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or code execution involved.",
  "flows": "Static data read from local file; no data flows to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns. It reads a local README.md file, which is common practice. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. All indicators point to benign, standard packaging code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are appropriate given the code's nature.",
