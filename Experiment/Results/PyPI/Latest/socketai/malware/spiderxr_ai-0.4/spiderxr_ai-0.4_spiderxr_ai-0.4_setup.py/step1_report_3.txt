{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'spiderxr_ai' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "The 'long_description' content could be exposed if the file content is malicious, but reading files itself is generally safe.",
  "flows": "The code reads from the filesystem (README.md) and then proceeds to setup package metadata; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious operations are detected. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools functions to specify package metadata. It reads a README file for detailed description, which is common in Python package setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be straightforward package configuration with no anomalies or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard and safe. It performs package configuration without any suspicious or malicious activities.",
