{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package named 'spiderxr_ai' with metadata and dependencies using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from 'README.md' to populate the long_description field.",
  "sinks": "The 'long_description' variable reads file content; no untrusted data flows to security-critical sinks.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' flows into 'long_description', but this is static file reading, not untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and project info. The only potential concern is reading 'README.md' for the long_description, but this file is typically part of the project and not user input. No network connections, dynamic code, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears benign and standard for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior detected.",
