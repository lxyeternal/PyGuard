{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for packaging a Python library named 'spiderxr_ai'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'README.md' file for long description and retrieves package information using 'find_packages()'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration reads static package information and a README file to prepare the package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors are present. The code strictly follows standard Python packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'setuptools' to configure package metadata, including name, version, packages, requirements, description, author info, URL, classifiers, and Python version compatibility. It reads the 'README.md' for detailed description, which is common practice. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data processing is observed. The code appears straightforward and secure, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration for a Python library. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
