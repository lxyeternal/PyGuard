{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup process that, during installation, collects system hostname, OS type, and external IP address, then exfiltrates this data to a remote webhook URL without user consent.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), platform.system(), requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to the external webhook URL with embedded system data",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources flows into URL construction, then requests.get() transmits data externally",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration occurs during package installation without user notification; no obfuscation; covert transmission of system info",
  "analysis": "The code executes a function during installation that gathers system hostname, OS, and public IP, then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external webhook URL. The behavior is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration. The exfiltration is covert, occurring automatically during install, which is privacy-invasive and suspicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.8-0.9, security risk 0.75-0.9, obfuscated 0) are consistent with this behavior. The data transmission could be used for tracking or malicious surveillance. The code does not contain obfuscation or destructive actions, but the privacy invasion justifies high risk and malware scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation, constituting malicious and privacy-invasive behavior. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation. Overall, the behavior warrants high security concern and should be flagged for further review or removal.",
