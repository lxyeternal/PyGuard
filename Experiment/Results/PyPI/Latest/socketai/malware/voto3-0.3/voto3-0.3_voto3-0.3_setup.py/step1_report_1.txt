  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'voto3' Python package, including a custom post-installation step.",
  "sources": "Reads platform information via platform.node() and platform.system(), and fetches external IP address using requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').",
  "sinks": "Sends data to a webhook URL constructed with platform info and IP address via requests.get.",
  "flows": "After installation, the script executes send(), which constructs a URL with system info and IP, then performs an HTTP GET request to that URL, sending system data externally.",
  "anomalies": "The send() function sends system hostname, OS type, and public IP address to an external webhook URL during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior. Use of requests to send data without user consent is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks but includes a custom function send() that collects system hostname, OS, and public IP address. It then transmits this data to an external webhook URL at installation time. This behavior is atypical for legitimate package installation scripts and indicates potential privacy invasion or malicious data exfiltration. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious payloads beyond data collection and transmission but is malicious in intent due to its covert data leakage. The use of requests to perform external data transmission during install is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external server during package installation, which is unusual and potentially harmful. This indicates a high risk of malicious intent.",
