{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package 'voto3', including a custom post-installation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information using platform.node() and platform.system(), and fetches external IP via requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL with system data and IP is sent via a GET request to a webhook URL, which can be used for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "After installation, the send() function is called, which retrieves system info and IP, then makes a GET request to a webhook URL containing this data.",
  "anomalies": "The post-install hook secretly sends system and network information to an external webhook without user consent, which is suspicious. The code does not validate or sanitize data before sending, and the use of a webhook for data exfiltration is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define a package with a custom install command. The custom command's run method calls send(), which prints a message and then constructs a URL with system hostname and OS, appending the public IP address fetched from a third-party service. It then performs a GET request to this URL, effectively transmitting system information to an external webhook. This behavior resembles data exfiltration. No other malicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code is designed to gather and transmit environment data secretly during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system and network information to an external webhook during installation, likely without user consent. This constitutes a privacy violation and potential security risk.",
