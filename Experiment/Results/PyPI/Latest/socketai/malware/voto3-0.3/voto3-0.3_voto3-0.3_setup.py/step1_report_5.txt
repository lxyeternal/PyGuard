{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package and performs a post-installation action that sends system information to a remote webhook URL.",
  "sources": "The function 'send()' reads system data using platform.node(), platform.system(), and makes an HTTP GET request to fetch the public IP address from 'https://api.ipify.org'.",
  "sinks": "The URL constructed in 'send()' is used to send a GET request to an external webhook, potentially transmitting sensitive system information.",
  "flows": "The system data collected ('platform.node()', 'platform.system()', and public IP) flows from 'send()' into the URL, which is then used in a GET request to the webhook endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an automated network request to a specified URL during installation, which is unusual for standard setup scripts. The URL includes system information and is invoked without user consent or explicit warning.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses setuptools to define a Python package. A custom install command is defined via 'PostInstallCommand', which calls the 'send()' function after installation. The 'send()' function constructs a URL embedding the hostname, OS name, and public IP address, and then makes an HTTP GET request to this URL. This behavior allows the package to transmit potentially sensitive system information to an external server without user knowledge. The code does not perform malicious activities like data theft or remote command execution but uses the installation process to exfiltrate data surreptitiously. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the data is sent immediately after installation, which is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by collecting system information and sending it to an external webhook during package installation without user consent. This is a privacy violation and can be considered a form of data exfiltration, indicating malicious intent.",
