{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration with a custom post-installation step that sends system information to a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via platform.node(), platform.system(), and makes an HTTP GET request to 'https://api.ipify.org' to obtain the external IP address.",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL is used in requests.get(), which sends an HTTP request to an external webhook URL with system info and IP address embedded in the URL query string.",
  "flows": "Source: platform.node(), platform.system(), requests.get('https://api.ipify.org') -> URL concatenation -> requests.get(url) to send data to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a hidden data exfiltration by sending system hostname, OS info, and external IP address to an external server during installation without user consent. The URL contains a unique identifier, suggesting tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and third-party requests. It defines a function 'send' that outputs a message and then constructs a URL containing system hostname, OS type, and external IP address fetched via requests to 'https://api.ipify.org'. This URL is used to make a GET request to a specific webhook, likely for data collection or tracking. The custom install command triggers this 'send' function post-installation, meaning every package installation results in sending system info to an external server. This behavior is hidden and not disclosed in package description, indicating malicious or at least privacy-invading intent. The use of a public webhook URL and the collection of system info without user knowledge is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly collects and exfiltrates system information during installation, which constitutes malicious behavior related to privacy invasion and potential data theft. This behavior is hidden within the post-install script and not documented in package description.",
