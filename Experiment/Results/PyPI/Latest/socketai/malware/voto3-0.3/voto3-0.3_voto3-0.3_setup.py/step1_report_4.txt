{
  "purpose": "This setup script installs the 'voto3' package and executes a post-installation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the platform node, system info, and the public IP address via requests to 'https://api.ipify.org'.",
  "sinks": "The URL constructed with platform and IP data is used to send a GET request to an external webhook URL, potentially leaking system information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system calls (platform.node(), platform.system(), requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')) into URL string concatenation, which then is used to make a GET request to an external webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The 'send()' function performs an automatic network request during installation, sending system info to a remote URL without user consent. The URL includes a webhook that could be used for tracking or malicious purposes. The code does not validate or restrict the request, making this behavior suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup utilities and additional modules 'os', 'requests', 'platform'. It defines a 'send()' function that outputs a message, constructs a URL with system info, and makes a GET request to that URL. The 'PostInstallCommand' class overrides the 'run()' method to invoke 'send()' after installation. The 'setup()' function configures the package, specifying the custom install command. The critical concern is the 'send()' function executing during package installation, sending sensitive system information (hostname, OS, IP address) to an external webhook, which could be malicious or privacy-invasive. No obfuscation or malicious code is present beyond this data exfiltration. The code does not perform any harmful system modifications or malicious activities besides the data leak.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes a hidden data exfiltration mechanism that sends system information to an external URL during installation. This behavior is suspicious and indicates potential malicious intent, such as tracking or privacy violation. No other malicious activities or vulnerabilities are evident.",
