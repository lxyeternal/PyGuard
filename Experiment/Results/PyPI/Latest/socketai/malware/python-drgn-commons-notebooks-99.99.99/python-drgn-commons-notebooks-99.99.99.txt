      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and transmitting sensitive system information during package installation without user consent. It uses straightforward commands and a hardcoded webhook URL, indicating potential malicious intent or privacy invasion. The high malware and security risk scores are justified based on the exfiltration activity. No obfuscation is present. Overall, this package should be treated with suspicion and further investigated."
