  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to gather system information and send it to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Input sources include 'sys.platform', 'os.popen' commands for system info ('uname', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist'), and 'os.popen' for 'whoami' and 'hostname'.",
  "sinks": "Data sent via 'os.system' using 'curl' with a POST request to a Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info and user details are gathered from various system commands (sources) and then sent through an 'os.system' call to an external URL (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code captures and transmits detailed system information, including hostname, current user, OS details, network configuration, and public IP, without explicit user consent or clear necessity for installation. The use of 'curl' to send data to an external webhook during installation is unusual and potentially malicious, as it could be used for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the installation process of a Python package to execute system commands that gather sensitive environment data such as hostname, current user, OS details, and network configurations across multiple platforms. It then constructs a JSON message containing this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a specific Slack webhook URL using 'curl'. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation, which is suspicious. The code does not perform any validation or consent prompts. The gathering and exfiltration of system information without user awareness suggest malicious intent or malicious potential, such as system reconnaissance or data theft. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malware signatures are present, but the behavior itself is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits potentially malicious behavior by collecting detailed system information during installation and exfiltrating it to an external Slack webhook. Such activity can be used for reconnaissance, tracking, or data theft, making it a security concern. The code's intent appears malicious or at least privacy-invasive, with no legitimate reason for this data collection during package setup.",
