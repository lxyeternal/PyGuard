{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom installation process for a Python package, during which it gathers system information and sends it to a Slack webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Input sources include os.popen() calls for system commands ('uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'whoami', 'hostname', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist'), and the current working directory via os.getcwd().",
  "sinks": "The untrusted data from these sources is formatted into a JSON payload and sent via os.system() to an external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system commands (sources) through string formatting into an HTTP POST request, which is executed by os.system() (sink), potentially transmitting system information externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes multiple system commands that collect potentially sensitive information (hostname, user identity, IP configuration, system info) and transmits this data without user consent or explicit need, which is unusual and suspicious. Use of os.popen() and os.system() for network communication with hardcoded URL indicates possible data exfiltration behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the 'install' command to run additional code during package installation. It gathers system information such as OS details, IP addresses, hostname, current directory, user identity, and process list, across multiple platforms. It then constructs a JSON message with this info and sends it to a Slack webhook URL via a shell command. This behavior is abnormal for a typical package installation, implying data collection and potential exfiltration. The URL used for posting is hardcoded, and no user consent is evident, indicating malicious intent or at least undesirable privacy intrusion. There are no signs of obfuscation, but the use of shell commands for sensitive data collection and transmission during installation is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects sensitive system information during package installation and transmits it externally via a Slack webhook, without user consent. This behavior suggests malicious intent related to data exfiltration. No obfuscation is present, but the malicious nature is evident from the data collection and transmission pattern.",
