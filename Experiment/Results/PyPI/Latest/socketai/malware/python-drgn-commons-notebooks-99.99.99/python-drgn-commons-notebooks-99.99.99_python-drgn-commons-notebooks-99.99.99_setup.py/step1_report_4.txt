  "purpose": "This code defines a custom installation procedure for a Python package, during which it collects system information and sends it via a webhook.",
  "sources": "Input sources include 'sys.platform', 'os.popen' commands ('uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'whoami', 'hostname'), and the current working directory 'os.getcwd()'.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via 'os.system' executing a 'curl' command to a Slack webhook URL with a JSON payload containing system info and user details.",
  "flows": "System info and user data obtained from sources are embedded into the JSON payload and transmitted over the network to the specified webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes network requests that transmit potentially sensitive system and user data to an external URL during installation, which is unusual and suspicious. The use of 'os.system' with concatenated strings to send data may pose security risks. The code captures 'whoami', 'hostname', system info, and IP addresses without user consent. The webhook URL appears hardcoded and is used for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'install' command from setuptools to run custom actions during package installation. It gathers system details depending on the OS platform, including system info, current directory, network configuration, and user identity. It then sends this data to an external Slack webhook via a 'curl' command embedded in 'os.system'. This behavior resembles data exfiltration, as it captures potentially sensitive information and transmits it without explicit user knowledge or consent. The data transmission occurs every time the package is installed, which could be exploited maliciously for unauthorized data collection. No malicious system modifications or backdoors are present beyond the data exfiltration pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs normal system information gathering but then exfiltrates this data to an external service during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious behavior. It appears designed to silently collect and send user/system data without transparency. Due to this data exfiltration and lack of user consent, the code exhibits malicious intent.",
