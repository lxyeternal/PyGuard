{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, user, IP, OS details) during installation and exfiltrates it via a hardcoded Slack webhook, likely for reconnaissance or data theft.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls for 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist', 'whoami', 'hostname'; os.system() for executing curl POST request.",
  "sinks": "The 'curl' command executed via os.system() sends collected data to an external webhook URL, transmitting sensitive information outside the system.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info commands) feed data into variables; these variables are formatted into a message string; the message is sent via os.system() executing a curl POST to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data collection and exfiltration during package installation; use of hardcoded webhook URL; collection of sensitive info without user consent; no obfuscation or encryption.",
  "analysis": "The code runs during package installation, executing system commands to gather sensitive system info. It constructs a message with hostname, user, IP, OS info, and current directory, then sends this data via a curl POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. The data collection uses os.popen() and os.system(), which are straightforward and unencrypted. The exfiltration occurs automatically during install, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive intent. No obfuscation or destructive payloads are present. The behavior is consistent with reconnaissance or data theft activities. The activity poses a high security and privacy risk, as sensitive data is transmitted without user awareness. The malware score is high (0.8) due to the exfiltration pattern, and the security risk score is similarly high (0.8), reflecting the potential for malicious misuse. The code's behavior is suspicious, and the activity warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and transmitting sensitive system information during package installation without user consent. It uses straightforward commands and a hardcoded webhook URL, indicating potential malicious intent or privacy invasion. The high malware and security risk scores are justified based on the exfiltration activity. No obfuscation is present. Overall, this package should be treated with suspicion and further investigated.",
