  "purpose": "Customize installation process to gather system information and send it via a webhook.",
  "sources": "Input sources include system commands: 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist', 'whoami', 'hostname'.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via an HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook URL using os.system with formatted data containing system info.",
  "flows": "System commands gather environment and network info (sources) -> formatted data is sent through os.system call to webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.popen and os.system for gathering and transmitting system info without validation, hardcoded webhook URL, and sending potentially sensitive info (hostname, IP, user info) to an external service.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, collects detailed system info across different platforms. It then constructs a message with this info and posts it directly to a Slack webhook URL using os.system with inline formatting. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating potential malicious intent or at least malicious behavior, as it sends system info to an external endpoint. The collection of environment info (hostname, user, IP, OS details) and transmission during install could be used for reconnaissance or tracking purposes. No malicious payload or harmful system modifications are present, but the data exfiltration behavior is suspicious, especially given the hardcoded webhook. The code is not obfuscated but employs dynamic command execution which is often used maliciously. Overall, the code appears to be exfiltrating system info during package installation without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect detailed system information during installation and send it to an external webhook, which is suspicious behavior. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and collection of sensitive data indicate potential malicious intent or privacy invasion. While no direct malware (e.g., destructive actions) is present, this exfiltration activity is a security concern.",
