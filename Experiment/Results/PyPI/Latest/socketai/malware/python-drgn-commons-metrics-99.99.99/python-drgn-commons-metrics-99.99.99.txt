      "conclusion": "The code is not malware in the traditional sense but exhibits malicious-like behavior through covert data exfiltration. The activity is privacy-invasive and could be misused, justifying high security risk scores. The malware score should be lowered to reflect the absence of malicious payloads, but the privacy invasion remains a significant concern."
