{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (OS details, hostname, user, IP addresses) during package installation and exfiltrates it via a hardcoded Slack webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Commands executed via os.popen and os.system, including 'uname', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'whoami', 'hostname'.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing a curl command that POSTs JSON data containing system info to an external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system commands into variables, then into a JSON payload, which is transmitted externally via a shell command.",
  "anomalies": "Collection and exfiltration of sensitive system data without user consent, using hardcoded webhook URL, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code performs system info gathering and transmits it covertly during installation, indicating privacy invasion. No malware or backdoors are present, but the exfiltration behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious. The use of shell commands and hardcoded URLs increases security concerns. The code is straightforward and lacks obfuscation, but its activity warrants high scrutiny.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not malware in the traditional sense but exhibits malicious-like behavior through covert data exfiltration. The activity is privacy-invasive and could be misused, justifying high security risk scores. The malware score should be lowered to reflect the absence of malicious payloads, but the privacy invasion remains a significant concern.",
