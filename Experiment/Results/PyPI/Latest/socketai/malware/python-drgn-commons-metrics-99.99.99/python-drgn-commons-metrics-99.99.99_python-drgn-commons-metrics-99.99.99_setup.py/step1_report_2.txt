{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom installation command for a Python package, which collects system information and sends it via a Slack webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "Data sources include 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist', 'whoami', and 'hostname' commands executed through os.popen and os.system.",
  "sinks": "The data collected is formatted into a JSON payload and sent via an HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook URL using os.system.",
  "flows": "System info commands gather data (sources), which is then incorporated into a JSON payload that is transmitted through an os.system call (sink) to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects potentially sensitive system information and transmits it to an external Slack webhook during installation without user consent or transparency; uses os.popen and os.system for command execution, which can be risky. The webhook URL is hardcoded and visible in the code, indicating potential data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the 'install' command in setuptools to execute additional code during package installation. It gathers detailed system information, including OS details, network configuration, user and host info, and then sends this data over the internet to a specific Slack webhook. This behavior is consistent across different operating systems. The use of os.popen and os.system for executing commands is risky, as it can be exploited or cause unintended side effects. The hardcoded webhook URL indicates that the package is designed to exfiltrate data without user knowledge. Collecting and transmitting system information during installation can be considered malicious or privacy-invasive behavior, especially given the lack of user awareness or opt-in.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits potentially malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system data and exfiltrating it to an external service during package installation. This behavior appears to be covert and could compromise user privacy. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and command execution functions further supports malicious intent.",
