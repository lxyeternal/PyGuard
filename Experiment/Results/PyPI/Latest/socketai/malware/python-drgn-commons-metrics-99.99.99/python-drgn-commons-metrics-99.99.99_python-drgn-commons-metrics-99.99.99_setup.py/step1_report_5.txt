{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process to gather system information and send it via a webhook, likely for monitoring or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Input sources include system commands ('uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'whoami', 'hostname', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist') executed via os.popen or os.system.",
  "sinks": "The webhook URL in os.system call that posts system info to a Slack channel; data sent includes host, user, public IP, current directory, OS info, and network configuration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system commands (sources) into string formatting in the os.system call, resulting in a POST request to the Slack webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes collecting detailed system info and publicly posting it to an external URL without clear user consent or notification. The URL used appears to be a legitimate Slack webhook but could be misused. No hardcoded secrets are visible, but the automatic collection and external transmission of system info is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the setup process to execute platform-specific commands that gather system details. It then constructs a JSON message with this info and sends it via a curl command to a Slack webhook URL. This behavior can be used for benign monitoring but also for malicious data exfiltration. The code does not perform any destructive actions or malicious system modifications, but the collection and external transmission of system info could be privacy-invasive or malicious if used without user consent. No obfuscated code, malware signatures, or malicious backdoors are apparent. The pattern suggests potential privacy invasion or surveillance activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain overt malicious code such as system damage or unauthorized access, but it systematically collects and transmits system information to an external webhook without user consent, which raises privacy concerns. Its behavior resembles surveillance or data exfiltration rather than typical package installation routines.",
