  "purpose": "Custom installation script that collects system information and sends it to a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads system info via os.popen (uname, ifconfig, curl, systeminfo, ipconfig, hostname, whoami), current directory, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Executes system commands with os.popen and os.system, sends data via HTTP POST to Slack webhook.",
  "flows": "Sources such as 'whoami', 'hostname', 'uname', 'ifconfig', etc. flow into the data payload, which is then sent to the Slack webhook endpoint via os.system call.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects sensitive system information, including hostname, user identity, IP addresses, and system configuration, and transmits it without user consent. Use of hardcoded Slack webhook URL is suspicious. No user input validation or sanitization occurs before data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to execute additional code during installation. It gathers various system details across different OS platforms, potentially sensitive information, and then transmits this data to an external Slack webhook URL using os.system. The payload includes hostname, current user, IP addresses, and system info. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which indicates potential malicious intent or at least malicious behavior, as it can be used to exfiltrate system data covertly. No malicious payload, malware, or backdoors are explicitly present beyond data exfiltration. The activity resembles surveillance or unauthorized data collection. The code does not perform malicious actions like file damage, reverse shells, or privilege escalation but secretly collects and transmits data. The code does not obfuscate its intent and uses common system commands, which are not inherently malicious but are used here for stealthy data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary purpose appears to be covert collection of system information and transmission to an external service via a hardcoded Slack webhook. This constitutes a privacy violation and could be used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. While not malware in the traditional sense, it demonstrates malicious intent by secretly harvesting and transmitting sensitive data without user consent.",
