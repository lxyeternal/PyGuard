  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "os.popen calls to retrieve system info, username, hostname; os.popen('curl ifconfig.me') for public IP; os.popen('whoami') and 'hostname'; os.system call to POST data to Slack webhook.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a curl command to send data to an external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info and user data are collected via os.popen, stored in variables, then formatted into a JSON payload sent via os.system to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects potentially sensitive data such as username, hostname, IP addresses, and system info, then exfiltrates this data to an external URL without user consent. The URL is hardcoded and resembles a Slack webhook, which could be malicious. No authentication or encryption mechanisms are used for data transmission. The use of os.popen and os.system for executing shell commands poses security risks if input is manipulated, though in this static code it appears hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command in setuptools, gathering system details based on OS. It constructs a payload with system information and exfiltrates it via a curl POST request to an external Slack webhook URL. The data collection includes sensitive system details and user information, which are sent without any encryption or user consent. The hardcoded webhook URL and the collection of environment data suggest malicious intent or at least malicious behavior, as this could facilitate system profiling or unauthorized data exfiltration. No malicious payloads such as malware or backdoors are present, but the exfiltration behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects and exfiltrates system and user information to an external webhook during installation, which is suspicious behavior and potentially malicious. While no malicious code or malware is directly embedded, the data exfiltration mechanism indicates a privacy violation or malicious intent.",
