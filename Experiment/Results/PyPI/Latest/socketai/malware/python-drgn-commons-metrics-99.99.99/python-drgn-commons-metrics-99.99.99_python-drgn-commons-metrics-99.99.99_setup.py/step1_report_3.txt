  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it to a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (`uname`, `systeminfo`, `ipconfig`), current working directory, user identity (`whoami`), hostname (`hostname`), and uses `curl` commands to send data.",
  "sinks": "Executes system commands (`os.popen`, `os.system`) and sends data via HTTP POST to a Slack webhook URL, potentially leaking sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Collects system info and user data -> formats JSON payload -> sends data to external Slack URL using `os.system`.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `os.popen` and `os.system` for executing system commands to collect info and transmit data. Hardcoded Slack webhook URL. No validation or obfuscation of commands. The code runs during package installation, which is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that executes during package setup. It gathers various system details based on the OS, including hostname, user, IP configurations, and system info. It then formats this data into a JSON string and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook URL, hardcoded in the script. The commands used (like `uname`, `ifconfig`, `curl`) are standard system commands but are used here to exfiltrate environment details without user consent. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and the collection of system info during install is suspicious. No obfuscation or malicious payloads like reverse shells or data theft of credentials are present, but the exfiltration behavior during install is concerning. The code appears to be intentionally collecting and transmitting system info, which can be considered malicious or at least intrusive.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to collect system information and send it to an external Slack webhook during package installation, which could be used for malicious tracking or exfiltration of system data. While it does not contain direct malware like data theft or backdoors, the exfiltration activity without user consent makes it suspicious and potentially malicious.",
