  "purpose": "This code customizes the installation process of a Python package to collect system information and send it to a specified Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Reading system information via os.popen (uname, ifconfig, curl, systeminfo, ipconfig, hostname, whoami).",
  "sinks": "Sending data via os.system with a curl command to an external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system commands (source) is concatenated into a JSON payload and sent through os.system call to the external URL (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.popen and os.system for executing shell commands to gather sensitive system info and sending it to an external webhook; no input validation or sanitization; hardcoded URL and message structure.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install method to execute system commands based on the platform, collecting system details such as hostname, current directory, IP configuration, and process info. It then formats this data into a JSON message and sends it via an unprotected curl command to an external Slack webhook URL. The use of os.popen and os.system to execute and transmit potentially sensitive data indicates malicious intent, especially since this occurs during installation, which can be considered a supply chain attack. No user consent or security checks are present. The code appears to be designed for data exfiltration without the user's knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and exfiltrating it to an external server during package installation. It does not perform any security validation or user consent, indicating potential malicious intent aimed at data theft or surveillance. The overall security risk is high.",
