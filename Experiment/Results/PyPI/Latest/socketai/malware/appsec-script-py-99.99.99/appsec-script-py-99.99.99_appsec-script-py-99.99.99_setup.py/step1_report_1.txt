{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to customize the installation process of a Python package, collecting system information and sending it to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads system information via os.popen() ('uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'whoami', 'hostname') and current working directory via os.getcwd().",
  "sinks": "Executes an os.system() call to send collected data via an HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered through os.popen() commands; this data is stored in variables, then formatted into a JSON payload, which is sent via os.system() to a remote URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data collection of system details and immediately transmits it to an external URL without user consent or clear purpose. The use of os.popen() and os.system() for data collection and transmission could be malicious, especially as it leaks environment details externally.",
  "analysis": "The script hooks into the package installation process by overriding the run() method of setuptools' install class. During installation, it collects system-specific information (OS details, network info, user info) using system commands executed via os.popen(). It then constructs a message including filename, hostname, user, IP addresses, and system info, which it transmits via an HTTP POST request embedded in os.system() to a Slack webhook URL. This behavior indicates the script is exfiltrating system data during installation, which is suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes like spying or data theft. There is no legitimate reason for a package to send system details externally during installation, and this behavior resembles covert data exfiltration or a backdoor.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly collects detailed system information and transmits it to an external Slack webhook during installation, indicating malicious intent or a security breach. The behavior violates principles of user privacy and software transparency, constituting a security risk.",
