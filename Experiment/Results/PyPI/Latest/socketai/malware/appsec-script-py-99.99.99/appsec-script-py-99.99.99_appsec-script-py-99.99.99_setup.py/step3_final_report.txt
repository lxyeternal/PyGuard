{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information during installation and exfiltrates it via a hardcoded Slack webhook URL without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls for system info, hostname, whoami; os.system() executing curl command for data transmission.",
  "sinks": "External HTTP POST request via curl to Slack webhook, transmitting system info and user data.",
  "flows": "System info collected through os.popen() → formatted into message → sent via os.system() curl command to external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Covert data exfiltration during package installation, use of hardcoded webhook URL, no user consent or transparency, straightforward code without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to gather system info (uname, ifconfig, systeminfo, ipconfig, hostname, whoami) and transmits this data to an external Slack webhook URL during package installation. It uses os.popen() and os.system() for command execution, which are straightforward and not obfuscated. The behavior indicates covert exfiltration of sensitive data, constituting a privacy breach and potential backdoor activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.75-1, security risk: 0.6-1) are appropriate given the exfiltration activity. The activity is malicious, and the activity's severity warrants high scores. The only inconsistency is in report 3, which underestimates malware risk; it should be increased to reflect malicious intent. Overall, the code is highly suspicious, with a malware score around 0.9 and security risk near 0.9, indicating a high probability of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration during package installation, representing a serious security and privacy threat. It should be classified as malicious with high malware and security risk scores. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack or backdoor activity, and the scores should be adjusted accordingly to reflect the high severity.",
