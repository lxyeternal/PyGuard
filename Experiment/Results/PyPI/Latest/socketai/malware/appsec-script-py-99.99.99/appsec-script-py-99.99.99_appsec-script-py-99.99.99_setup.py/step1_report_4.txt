{
  "purpose": "Custom installation script that collects system information and sends it to a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system info via os.popen (uname, ifconfig, systeminfo, ipconfig, whoami, hostname), reading current working directory, and executing system commands via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Sending data to external URL via curl command embedded in os.system, exposing system information (hostname, user, IP, OS info, working directory).",
  "flows": "Sources such as os.popen and os.getcwd feed into the variables. These are then formatted into a JSON payload and sent via curl in os.system, transmitting potentially sensitive info to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs system information collection and sends it to an external URL without any user consent or obvious security controls. Use of os.popen and os.system to execute shell commands is risky, especially with data that might be considered sensitive.",
  "analysis": "The code hooks into the package's install process and collects various system details including hostname, user info, IP addresses, and OS info using shell commands. It then constructs a JSON payload with this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook. This behavior can be considered malicious or at least intrusive because it exfiltrates system information during installation without user knowledge or consent. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and executing system commands dynamically could be exploited for malicious purposes. The script does not perform any malicious actions beyond data collection and exfiltration, but its purpose and behavior are privacy-invasive and could be leveraged for malicious monitoring or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects detailed system information and transmits it externally without user consent, indicating malicious or privacy-invading behavior. While it does not directly harm the system, it could be used for malicious surveillance or data exfiltration, representing a security concern.",
