  "purpose": "A simple function that adds 1 to a given number.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result; no external data sinks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the addition operation, then to the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, clear function performing addition. No external dependencies, environment variables, or side effects. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and directness justify zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence in this assessment is high due to the code's trivial nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
