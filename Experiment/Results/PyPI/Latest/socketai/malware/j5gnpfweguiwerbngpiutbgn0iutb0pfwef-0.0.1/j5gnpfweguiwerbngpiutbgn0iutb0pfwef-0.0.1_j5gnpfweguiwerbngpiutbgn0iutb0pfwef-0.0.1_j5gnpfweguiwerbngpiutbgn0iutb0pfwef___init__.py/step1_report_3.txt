  "purpose": "Collect system information (package name, hostname, current working directory) and send it to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Reading environment data: package name, hostname, current working directory.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to an external domain, transmitting system information.",
  "flows": "Source data (PACKAGE_NAME, HOSTNAME, CURRENT_PATH) -> data dictionary -> requests.post() -> external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded package name that appears random or obfuscated; external communication to a suspicious URL; no validation or user consent observed.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system information and immediately posts it to a specified URL. The package name appears intentionally obfuscated or randomly generated, possibly to avoid detection or to hide malicious intent. The data transmission occurs without user interaction or clear purpose, which can be suspicious. The external URL is a custom domain, potentially controlled by an attacker or used for malicious exfiltration. No malicious payload or system modifications are evident, but the behavior of collecting and sending system info to an external endpoint without user approval is suspicious and could be part of reconnaissance or data exfiltration activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to gather system details and transmit them to an external server without clear justification or user consent. The use of an obfuscated package name and suspicious URL indicates potential malicious intent or privacy violations. While no direct malicious actions like malware deployment are observed, the behavior warrants caution due to data exfiltration risk.",
