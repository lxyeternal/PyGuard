{
  "purpose": "Collects system information (package name, hostname, current working directory) and sends it to a specified external URL.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment (os.getcwd()), system (socket.gethostname()), and predefined constants (PACKAGE_NAME).",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via an HTTP POST request to an external URL.",
  "flows": "System information sources (PACKAGE_NAME, HOSTNAME, CURRENT_PATH) are gathered and then transmitted to the external server through requests.post().",
  "anomalies": "Use of a random, non-descriptive package name; external communication with an untrusted domain; no validation or encryption; possible data exfiltration behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code collects basic system info and transmits it to a suspicious external domain. The package name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which can indicate malicious intent. No user input is directly used, but the data transmission to an external server without encryption or user consent is suspicious. The URL domain is obscure, raising concerns about command and control or data exfiltration. No other malicious code or backdoors are evident, but the behavior aligns with data collection for potentially malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to perform system information exfiltration to an external server, which could be malicious or part of a tracking or reconnaissance activity. It warrants caution due to suspicious domain use and data collection behavior.",
