  "purpose": "Collect system information (package name, hostname, current directory) and send it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reading package name (hardcoded), hostname (via socket.gethostname()), current working directory (via os.getcwd()).",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to external URL with system data.",
  "flows": "System info sources (package name, hostname, current path) flow into the data dictionary, which is then sent via requests.post to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a random-looking package name; data exfiltration to a suspicious URL; no validation or user input handling; no encryption or obfuscation; hardcoded URL and package name.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers basic system information, including a hardcoded package name, hostname, and current directory, then transmits this data to a remote server via an HTTP POST request. The target URL appears suspicious, potentially used for tracking or data exfiltration. The package name appears random, which could be an attempt to evade detection. No other malicious behavior such as command execution or data harvesting is present. Overall, the code is simple but suspicious in its intent to send system info to an external endpoint, likely for malicious or tracking purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates system information to an external server without user consent or validation, indicating malicious intent related to data collection or tracking. The use of a suspicious URL and hardcoded identifiers increases suspicion of malicious behavior.",
