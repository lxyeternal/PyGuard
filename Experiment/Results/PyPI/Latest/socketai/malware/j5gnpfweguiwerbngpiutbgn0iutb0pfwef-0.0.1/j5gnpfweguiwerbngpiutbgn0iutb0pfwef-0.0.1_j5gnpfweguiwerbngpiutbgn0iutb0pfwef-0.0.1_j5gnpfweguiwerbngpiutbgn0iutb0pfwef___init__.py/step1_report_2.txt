{
  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname via socket.gethostname(), current working directory via os.getcwd().",
  "sinks": "Sending data via requests.post to an external URL.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, current path, package name) is collected and transmitted over the network to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a seemingly random package name, external communication with a suspicious URL, no validation or encryption of data, lack of any purpose or user interaction in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system-specific information, including hostname and current working directory, and sends it to an external server. The package name appears arbitrary, possibly obfuscated, which might suggest malicious intent. The URL used for POST requests points to a suspicious or potentially malicious domain (oastify.com is often used in security testing but can also be abused for data exfiltration). There are no input validations or checks, and no apparent benign purpose. The code does not perform any other operation besides data collection and transmission, indicating potential privacy violation or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for covertly collecting and transmitting system information to an external server, which is suspicious and could be malicious or used for tracking purposes. It exhibits behaviors typical of data exfiltration scripts with no clear benign purpose.",
