{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function to print 'hello world' and executes it if run as the main module.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read; the code does not accept user input or read files.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external system interactions are present; no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only executes a static print statement without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "There is a syntax error: 'if __name__ = \"__main__\":' should be 'if __name__ == \"__main__\":'. The incorrect equality operator '=' instead of '==' indicates a bug, but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic Python script intended to print 'hello world'. It contains a syntax error in the main guard condition, which would prevent execution. No external data is read, and there are no suspicious functions or behaviors. The syntax error could be exploited to cause denial of service if the code is used maliciously, but it is likely unintentional and does not suggest malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign script with a syntax error. It does not contain malicious code or behaviors. The error is a coding mistake rather than an indication of malicious intent.",
