{
  "purpose": "Defines a simple function to print 'hello world' and executes it if the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "No input sources; code does not read external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; code only prints to stdout.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; no source-to-sink data paths present.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in the conditional statement: '=' should be '=='. No malicious or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python script defining a hello() function that prints a greeting. The main block contains a syntax error: 'if __name__ = \"__main__\":' should be 'if __name__ == \"__main__\":'. Due to this error, the script will not execute as intended. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. The code is straightforward and benign, just with a syntax mistake.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple, non-malicious example with a syntax error preventing proper execution. There are no indications of malware or security risks.",
