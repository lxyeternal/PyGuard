{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function to print 'hello world' and executes it when run as the main program.",
  "sources": "Input is minimal; the code does not read external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the print statement, which outputs to standard output.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: when executed, the main block calls hello(), which prints a message.",
  "anomalies": "There is a syntax error in the main guard: '=' should be '=='. This indicates the code would not run as intended and is not malicious but incomplete or erroneous.",
  "analysis": "The code is very simple, with no signs of malicious behavior. It contains a syntax error in the main guard, preventing execution. No hardcoded secrets, external data flows, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a trivial example or a mistake rather than malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks but has a syntax error that would prevent execution. It appears to be a basic or incomplete example rather than malicious code.",
