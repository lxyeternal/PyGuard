  "purpose": "Simple function to print 'hello world'",
  "sources": "No input sources; code is static with no data input",
  "sinks": "Standard output via print statement",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; straightforward execution of print",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in the main guard ('=' instead of '==') which prevents proper execution",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function that prints 'hello world'. The main guard contains a syntax error: 'if __name__ = \"__main__\":' should be 'if __name__ == \"__main__\":'. Due to this typo, the script will raise a SyntaxError and not execute the hello() function. No malicious code, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is very simple and does not pose any security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious script with a syntax error preventing execution. It poses no security threat or malware risk.",
