  "purpose": "A simple function that prints 'hello world' when run as a script.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output beyond standard print statement.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from source to sink involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Syntax error in the if statement: '=' should be '=='. No malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'hello' that prints a greeting. The conditional block intended to execute the function when run directly contains a syntax error ('if __name__ = \"__main__\"' should be 'if __name__ == \"__main__\"'). The syntax error prevents execution and indicates a flaw rather than malicious intent. There are no external data inputs, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign script intended for demonstration. The syntax error does not suggest malicious activity but indicates the code is incomplete or improperly written. No malware or security risks are present.",
