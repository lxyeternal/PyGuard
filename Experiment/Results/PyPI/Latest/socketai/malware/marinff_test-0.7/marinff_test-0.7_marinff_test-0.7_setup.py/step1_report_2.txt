{
  "purpose": "This setup script is designed to install a Python module and execute embedded malicious code to establish a reverse shell connection.",
  "sources": "The code reads an obfuscated array of integers which is decoded into a script, and uses os.system to execute commands including writing a decoded script to /tmp/xxx.py and executing it via base64 decoding and bash.",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing dynamically generated code, writing to a temporary file, and running a base64-decoded script, which may contain malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated code array is decoded into a script, saved to /tmp/xxx.py, then a reverse shell command is constructed, base64 encoded, decoded, and executed via bash, establishing a remote connection.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscation with character code transformations, dynamic execution via os.system, writing potentially malicious code to /tmp, and creates a reverse shell which is highly suspicious and malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains an obfuscated array of integers representing script content, which is decoded into a script and saved to /tmp/xxx.py. It then constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes, and executes it via bash. The setup function's description explicitly states 'install this module then reverse shell', indicating malicious intent. The use of obfuscation, temporary file writing, and execution of decoded code points to malicious payload delivery. These behaviors align with common supply chain attack tactics such as embedding malicious scripts within packages to establish unauthorized remote access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, embedding obfuscated reverse shell code that is decoded and executed during installation. It is clearly designed to compromise the system by opening a remote connection, violating security best practices. The package should not be used.",
