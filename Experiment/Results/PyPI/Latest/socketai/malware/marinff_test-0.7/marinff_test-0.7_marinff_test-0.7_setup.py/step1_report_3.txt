{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to install a Python package and execute obfuscated malicious code that results in a reverse shell connection.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input sources directly but contains obfuscated code embedded within the 'CustomInstall' class that is decoded at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The decoded 'code' string is written to '/tmp/xxx.py' and executed via 'os.system'. Subsequently, a reverse shell command is constructed, base64-encoded, decoded, and executed through 'os.system', which can lead to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated code is decoded and written to a temporary file; then, a reverse shell command is generated, base64-encoded, decoded, and executed, creating a source-to-sink flow that ultimately leads to remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscation with a large array of numbers shifted by 30, decoding to a string that is written as a Python script. It then encodes a reverse shell command in base64, decodes it, and executes it via shell. This pattern indicates malicious intent. No legitimate purpose is apparent for such obfuscation and command execution.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation process that, upon running, decodes an obfuscated script embedded as a list of integers, writes it to a temporary file, and executes it. It then constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes it, and executes it, which could establish a remote connection or provide system control to an attacker. The use of obfuscation, writing, and executing code from temporary files, combined with reverse shell commands, strongly suggests malicious behavior designed to compromise system security.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains obfuscated malicious code intended to establish a reverse shell, representing a serious security threat. The code is intentionally concealed through obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating malicious intent. Usage of this package could lead to remote compromise of the host system.",
