{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform a custom installation process that executes obfuscated code, creates a reverse shell script, and executes it, likely for malicious remote access.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated byte array decoded into code, environment variables, and file operations creating /tmp/xxx.py.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the generated code via os.system, running the reverse shell command, and writing to /tmp/xxx.py.",
  "flows": "The byte array is decoded into code, written to /tmp/xxx.py, then executed as a reverse shell using base64 decoding and bash, enabling remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code with encoded byte array that is decoded at runtime, writing potentially malicious code to a temporary file, and executing it. The script explicitly states 'install this module then reverse shell', indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the installation process by decoding an obfuscated code payload from a byte array, writing it to a temporary Python script, and executing it as a reverse shell command. The use of base64 encoding and dynamic code execution is suspicious. The code explicitly aims to establish a reverse shell, which is a common malicious tactic. All this occurs during package installation, which is a supply chain risk. The code shows no legitimate function besides a misleading description. It also obfuscates its true purpose by hiding the actual code in an encoded byte array.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains deliberate malicious behavior, including code obfuscation, dynamic execution, and a reverse shell payload, indicating high malicious intent. The package's installation process is used as a vector to execute malicious code, posing a severe security risk.",
