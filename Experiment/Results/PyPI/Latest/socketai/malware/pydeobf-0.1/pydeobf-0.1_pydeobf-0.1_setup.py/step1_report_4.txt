{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process to download and execute an external executable file from a remote URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/output from subprocess calls for executing PowerShell commands and accesses the current working directory via os.getcwd().",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded file via Start-Process potentially runs untrusted code. The subprocess.run calls execute PowerShell commands that could be manipulated or used maliciously.",
  "flows": "Download command fetches a file from a remote URL; if successful, the script opens the file with Start-Process, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes automatically downloading and executing an external executable during package installation. The URL points to a raw file on GitHub, which may be malicious. No validation or checks are performed on the downloaded file. The use of PowerShell commands to fetch and execute code is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard installation process to include downloading an executable from an external source using PowerShell. If the download succeeds, it immediately opens (executes) the file, which could be malicious. The URL used is external and not validated, and the code does not perform any security checks on the downloaded file. This pattern resembles malicious activity such as delivering malware during installation. The code structure is straightforward but intentionally suspicious, with no safeguards or user prompts. The overall behavior indicates an attempt to covertly install or execute potentially harmful code.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation without validation or user consent. This is a high-risk behavior that could lead to system compromise.",
