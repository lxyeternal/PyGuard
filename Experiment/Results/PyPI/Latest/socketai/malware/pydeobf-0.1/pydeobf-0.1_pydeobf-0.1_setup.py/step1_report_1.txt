{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes an external executable during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the internet via PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest and potentially executes or opens the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'Start-Process' to run the downloaded executable file ('CBLines.exe').",
  "flows": "Download file from URL -> Save to disk -> Open or execute the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes automatically downloading and opening an external executable during package installation without user consent. Use of PowerShell commands for downloading and execution. No validation or sandboxing of the downloaded file.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard install process to download an executable file from a remote URL using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest. If successful, it attempts to open or execute the file with Start-Process. This behavior could be malicious as it automatically fetches and runs external code, potentially installing malware or unwanted software during package installation. The code does not validate the downloaded file or inform the user, and it executes external code without clear user consent. Such behavior is highly suspicious and is a common tactic in supply chain attacks to distribute malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation without user approval or validation, posing a significant security risk. It is highly likely to be malicious or harmful.",
