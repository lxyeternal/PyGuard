{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from hardcoded URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe' to download an executable file.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the downloaded file using PowerShell's Start-Process, which can run the executable without user consent.",
  "flows": "Source: URL fetch via Invoke-WebRequest -> Sink: Running the downloaded executable with Start-Process.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable file from an external source during installation and executes it without verification or user awareness. Use of PowerShell commands for silent download and execution is suspicious. No validation or signature checks are present.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard install process to download a file from a hardcoded URL and immediately execute it using PowerShell commands. The download and execution happen silently during package installation, which could be malicious. The executable could contain malware, backdoors, or other malicious payloads. No checks are performed on the downloaded file to verify its integrity or source. The code's purpose appears to be to run an external executable during installation, which is suspicious behavior. This pattern aligns with potential supply chain attacks or malicious package behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation without verification, indicating high risk of malicious intent.",
