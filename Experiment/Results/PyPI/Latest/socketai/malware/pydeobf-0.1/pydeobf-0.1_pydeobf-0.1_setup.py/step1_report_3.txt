{
  "purpose": "This script customizes the installation process for a Python package by downloading and executing an external executable file.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the internet via PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest and the URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe'.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the downloaded file using PowerShell Start-Process, which may run malicious code if the file is harmful.",
  "flows": "Source: URL download via Invoke-WebRequest -> sink: execution of the downloaded file via Start-Process.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from a third-party URL during installation and immediately runs it without verification or user consent, which is highly suspicious and typical of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard Python package installation process to include downloading an executable file from a remote URL. It uses PowerShell commands to download and execute the file. There are no checksums, signatures, or user prompts, indicating a potential for malicious code execution. The downloaded file's URL points to a GitHub raw link, which could host malicious payloads. Automatically executing this file poses a significant security risk. The code does not perform any validation or sandboxing of the downloaded file. This behavior resembles typical supply chain attack techniques, where malicious payloads are delivered during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation without verification, posing a severe security risk. This pattern indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent and should be considered unsafe.",
