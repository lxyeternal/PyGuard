{
  "purpose": "Custom installation script that downloads and executes an external executable during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe' for the executable file; uses subprocess to execute PowerShell commands for downloading and opening the file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via 'Start-Process' which opens and runs the executable, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "Code downloads the file from the URL (source), then immediately executes it with 'Start-Process' (sink), creating a source-to-sink execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes automatic download and execution of a remote executable during package installation without user consent, hardcoded URL, and reliance on PowerShell commands that can be leveraged for malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the default 'install' command in setuptools. It constructs PowerShell commands to download an executable from a remote URL and then opens it with 'Start-Process'. The download success is checked, and the executable is launched immediately. This behavior is suspicious because it involves automatic download and execution of external code during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware delivery. No validation or sandboxing is performed, and the URL appears hardcoded, indicating potential malicious intent. The code uses subprocess with 'shell=True', increasing the risk of command injection if the URL or path were manipulated, though in this case, the URL is hardcoded. Overall, this pattern resembles malware behavior—downloading and executing remote code without user awareness or consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs suspicious activity by automatically downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent and should be considered a security risk. The behavior could lead to system compromise, making this package potentially malicious.",
