  "purpose": "A simple Python script that outputs the string 'hello'.",
  "sources": "None; static string literal used directly in print statement.",
  "sinks": "Console output via print() function.",
  "flows": "Static string flows directly into the print() sink without any external input or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic print statement with a static string, with no input sources, external data, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and safety of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.",
