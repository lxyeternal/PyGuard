{
  "purpose": "The script collects Telegram user data from the 'tdata' directory, compresses it, and exfiltrates it via a Telegram bot, then deletes the local archive.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'USERNAME', accesses files in the Telegram 'tdata' directory, reads the ZIP file for upload.",
  "sinks": "Uploads the ZIP file to Telegram via the bot API, deletes the ZIP file after upload.",
  "flows": "Data collection from user directory -> compression -> upload via Telegram API -> file deletion.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot API key and chat ID, automatic execution on import, broad exception handling that suppresses errors, no user consent or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code reads user data from a sensitive directory, compresses it, and exfiltrates it silently using embedded credentials. It operates automatically without user consent, and exceptions are broadly caught, masking errors. The embedded credentials and silent operation are typical of malicious exfiltration scripts. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present beyond data theft. The behavior aligns with privacy-invasive malware, with high potential for harm.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior through silent data exfiltration of sensitive user information using embedded credentials, automatic execution, and lack of user consent. It should be classified as high-severity malware with maximum security risk. The embedded credentials and silent operation make it a privacy-invasive threat. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but its intent and behavior are clearly malicious.",
