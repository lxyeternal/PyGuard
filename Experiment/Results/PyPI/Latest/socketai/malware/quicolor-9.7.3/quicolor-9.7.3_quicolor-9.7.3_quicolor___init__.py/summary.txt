  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior through silent data exfiltration of sensitive user information using embedded credentials, automatic execution, and lack of user consent. It should be classified as high-severity malware with maximum security risk. The embedded credentials and silent operation make it a privacy-invasive threat. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but its intent and behavior are clearly malicious."
