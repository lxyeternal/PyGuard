{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'quicolor' Python package, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Input data: package metadata (name, version, author info), dependencies (requests), package files.",
  "sinks": "Installation process, package distribution, dependency management; no direct untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; setup script primarily defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets detected. The description states it is an 'automatic Telegram Desktop backup utility,' but no code performs such actions here.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setuptools setup configuration, defining package metadata and requirements. It imports only setup and find_packages from setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity. The 'install_requires' includes 'requests', which is common and not suspicious. The description mentions backup utility, but there are no functions or code performing such operations. No anomalies or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no security risks. The package appears to be a standard, benign configuration for distribution.",
