  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup parameters for the 'quicolor' Python package distribution.",
  "sources": "Static data within setup() function: package metadata, dependencies, author info, URL, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leakage points, no external code execution or dynamic content.",
  "flows": "N/A, the code is declarative configuration with no runtime data flow or user input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures; setup configuration appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setuptools setup configuration defining package metadata, dependencies, and distribution info. No code execution, input reading, or external data handling occurs. The dependencies are common, and there are no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns. The description indicates a backup utility for Telegram, but the code itself is merely packaging metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any data collection, network activity, or runtime logic that could be malicious.",
