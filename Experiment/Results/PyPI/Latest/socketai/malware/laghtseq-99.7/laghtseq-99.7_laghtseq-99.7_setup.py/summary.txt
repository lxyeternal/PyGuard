  "conclusion": "The code executes arbitrary code during installation by calling 'main()', which poses a significant security risk. While the actual maliciousness depends on 'main.py', the pattern itself is inherently dangerous and warrants caution. The scores should reflect the high potential for malicious activity, with malware and risk scores around 0.75, aligning with supply chain security best practices."
