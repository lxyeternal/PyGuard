  "purpose": "Set up and install a Python package named 'laghtseq' with a custom installation step that executes code from main.py.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'main' from main.py during the custom install process.",
  "sinks": "Executing 'main()' during installation, which could run arbitrary code from main.py.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method calls 'main()' from main.py, executing its code.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes 'main()' unconditionally during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, after completing the standard install process, imports and executes 'main()' from main.py. This behavior could be exploited if main.py contains malicious code, as it executes arbitrary code during package installation. There are no other suspicious imports or code constructs; the setup configuration appears typical except for the execution of 'main()'. The use of a custom install step that runs additional code is a common vector for supply chain attacks if the content of main.py is malicious. The code does not appear obfuscated, and no hardcoded secrets or network operations are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes 'main()' from main.py during installation, which poses a potential supply chain security risk if main.py contains malicious code. This behavior warrants scrutiny of the main.py content, as it could run arbitrary code during package install.",
