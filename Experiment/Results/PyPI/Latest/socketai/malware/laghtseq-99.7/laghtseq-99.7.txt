      "conclusion": "The code executes arbitrary code during installation by calling 'main()', which poses a significant security risk. While the actual maliciousness depends on 'main.py', the pattern itself is inherently dangerous and warrants caution. The scores should reflect the high potential for malicious activity, with malware and risk scores around 0.75, aligning with supply chain security best practices."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, justifying high malware and security risk scores. The activity aligns with malware or spyware, and the scores in the reports are consistent and justified. No adjustments are necessary."
