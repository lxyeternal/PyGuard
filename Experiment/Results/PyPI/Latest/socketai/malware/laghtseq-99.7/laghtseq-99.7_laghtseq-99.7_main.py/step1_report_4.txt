  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded URLs that appear suspicious and domain names associated with OAST (which may be used for security testing or malicious C2 channels). No user consent prompts or logging controls. The code silently sends system info without user awareness.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, and current directory, then generates a random number as an identifier. It constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to three remote servers. The URLs are obscure and may be used for tracking, C2 communication, or data exfiltration. The code does not verify the server responses or provide user prompts, indicating potentially malicious or unauthorized data transmission. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present, but the intent to silently leak system info to unknown servers is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect system data and send it to remote servers without user consent, potentially for malicious purposes such as tracking or data exfiltration. The use of suspicious URLs and silent operation raises security concerns.",
