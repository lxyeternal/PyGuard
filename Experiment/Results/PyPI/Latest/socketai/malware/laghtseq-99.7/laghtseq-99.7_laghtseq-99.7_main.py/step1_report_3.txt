{
  "purpose": "Collects system information (hostname, username, current directory) and sends it to multiple remote URLs with a random identifier.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() with constructed URLs",
  "flows": "System info sources → URL construction → HTTP GET request to remote server",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external URLs, sending system info (hostname, username, directory) to external servers, no authentication or encryption, use of random number for URL parameter, potential data exfiltration without user consent",
  "analysis": "The script gathers host-specific information and transmits it via HTTP GET requests to three external domains. The domains are suspicious, and the code does not include any user consent or encryption. The URL contains a random number to likely prevent caching and track individual requests. The code attempts to read and log the server response but primarily functions as a data exfiltration mechanism, which is a malicious pattern. No other malicious actions like file modification or command execution are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to exfiltrate system information to external malicious domains, indicating malicious intent. The structure is straightforward but suspicious due to the external URLs and data collection without user knowledge. It demonstrates potentially malicious behavior primarily aimed at data theft or reconnaissance.",
