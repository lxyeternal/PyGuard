  "purpose": "Utility functions for Ethereum ABI signature generation and hashing, including converting ABI components to signature strings and computing keccak-based selectors and log topics.",
  "sources": "ABI data structures ('type', 'components', 'name', 'inputs') used as input parameters for functions.",
  "sinks": "Keccak hashing functions applied to signature strings; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "ABI data is processed to generate signature strings, which are then hashed with keccak to produce selectors/log topics.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code processes Ethereum ABI components to produce function signatures and event signatures, then hashes these signatures with keccak to generate selectors and log topics. It includes standard error handling for data types and follows Ethereum conventions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The 'keccak' function is imported from a local module, presumed standard. The code does not handle untrusted user input directly, nor does it perform network or file operations. The cryptographic operations are deterministic and standard, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for Ethereum ABI signature handling. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
