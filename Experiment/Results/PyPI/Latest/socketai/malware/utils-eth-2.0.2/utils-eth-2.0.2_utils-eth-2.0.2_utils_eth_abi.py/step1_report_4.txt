  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling Ethereum smart contract ABI data, including converting ABIs to function signatures and generating 4-byte selectors and log topics.",
  "sources": "Input data is obtained from the 'abi' dictionaries and string parameters such as event signatures.",
  "sinks": "The keccak hashing function is used to generate cryptographic hashes, which could be a point of concern if misused, but here it appears to be used for standard Ethereum signature generation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from ABI dictionaries and string inputs through functions that produce cryptographic hashes, then extracts slices for selectors or log topics.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The use of keccak is standard in Ethereum applications.",
  "analysis": "The functions are standard utility functions for Ethereum ABI processing: 'collapse_if_tuple' processes nested tuple types; '_abi_to_signature' constructs function signatures; 'function_signature_to_4byte_selector' generates a 4-byte selector; 'event_signature_to_log_topic' generates event log topics. All hashing operations use the 'keccak' function imported from a local module. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. Its structure and logic are typical for blockchain-related cryptographic operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for Ethereum ABI handling and cryptographic signature generation. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It performs normal cryptographic hashing for Ethereum contract interactions.",
