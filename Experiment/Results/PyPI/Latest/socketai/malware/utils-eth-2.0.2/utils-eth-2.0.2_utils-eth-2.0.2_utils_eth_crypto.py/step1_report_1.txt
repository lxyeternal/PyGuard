  "purpose": "Compute Keccak (SHA-3) hash from various input types using the eth_hash library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: primitive, hexstr, text",
  "sinks": "Call to keccak_256 hashing function, which processes data derived from the inputs",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> to_bytes conversion -> keccak_256 hash function",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious variables, or unusual code patterns; reliance on external 'to_bytes' function, which is assumed safe",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to generate a Keccak hash from multiple input types by converting inputs to bytes via 'to_bytes' and then hashing with 'keccak_256'. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The use of well-known cryptographic libraries appears standard. The only potential concern is the external 'to_bytes' function, but without its implementation, there is no indication of malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for hashing inputs with Keccak. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks in the provided code snippet.",
