{
  "purpose": "A utility function that hashes various input types using keccak_256 after converting them to bytes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: primitive, hexstr, text; external function to_bytes for conversion.",
  "sinks": "keccak_256 hashing function; no data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> to_bytes conversion -> keccak_256 hashing -> output bytes",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; reliance on external to_bytes without its implementation noted.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper for keccak hashing, converting inputs to bytes via an external function and hashing them. No malicious patterns, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The security depends on the safety of to_bytes, which is assumed benign. Scores across reports consistently indicate no malware, no obfuscation, and very low security risk, aligning with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign cryptographic utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate; the primary consideration is verifying the safety of to_bytes, but based on current information, the code is safe.",
