{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for human-readable formatting of seconds, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function arguments, such as bytes, strings, integers, and URIs, mainly for formatting and validation purposes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks that handle untrusted data in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities, such as network connections, file writes, or command executions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to formatting outputs; there are no transformations or operations that process untrusted data into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The functions are straightforward utility methods with no dynamic code execution or external calls besides standard library functions. No suspicious patterns like obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several utility functions for formatting durations, byte arrays, hashes, IPFS URIs, and sequences. It includes input validation for IPFS URIs and CIDv0 hashes, but these are standard checks based on string patterns. No external system calls, network activity, or file operations are present. The code primarily performs string manipulation and formatting, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious side effects. The functions are self-contained, with clear intent, and do not process untrusted data into critical system actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of utility functions for data formatting and validation. No malicious activity, supply chain risks, or security vulnerabilities are detected based on this code snippet.",
