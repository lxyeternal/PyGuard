{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for human-readable formatting of seconds, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters such as seconds, bytes, Hash32 objects, URI strings, and integer iterables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only formats and processes input data without writing to files, network, or other systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatting functions, with no external system calls, network access, or untrusted data processing beyond parsing and string manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious activities are detected. Usage of common libraries (typing, urllib.parse, eth_typing) appears standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for human-readable representations of durations, byte hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences. It uses standard parsing and formatting logic with no external system interactions, file I/O, or network operations. Functions perform checks such as URI validation and hash format validation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code structure and formatting are typical for utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module focused on data formatting. It contains no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware. No security risks are evident beyond the safe use of input validation.",
