{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for humanizing and formatting various data types such as seconds, bytes, hashes, URIs, and integer sequences, primarily for display purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, such as seconds (numeric), bytes, hash values, URIs, and integer sequences.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable sinks include string formatting and parsing functions, which could be exploited if malicious data is passed to them, especially in URI parsing and string operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatting and parsing functions, with validation in some cases (e.g., URI validation). No untrusted data is used in system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code predominantly performs data formatting and validation, with no code injection, network calls, or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data formatting functions, including humanizing seconds, bytes, and hash representations, as well as IPFS URI validation and humanization. It uses safe parsing and validation routines, with proper handling of inputs. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The functions are straightforward, with clear intent, and do not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The use of string formatting is safe given the context, and no dynamic code execution is present. The URI validation function correctly checks for IPFS schemes and CIDv0 hashes, preventing misuse. Overall, the code appears to be benign utility functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions for data representation and validation, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security threats. It appears to be safe and focused on formatting and validation tasks.",
