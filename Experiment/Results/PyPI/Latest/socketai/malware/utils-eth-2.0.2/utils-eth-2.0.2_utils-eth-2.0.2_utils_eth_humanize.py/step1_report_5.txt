{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for humanizing durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences, primarily for display or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as bytes, Hash32 hashes, strings (URIs), and integer sequences.",
  "sinks": "The code performs string formatting, parsing, and yield-based data processing; it does not write data to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through functions like humanize_bytes, humanize_hash, humanize_ipfs_uri, and humanize_seconds, ultimately producing human-readable strings or sequences.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code relies on standard Python libraries and straightforward logic. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The functions are primarily for formatting and humanizing data such as seconds, bytes, hashes, and IPFS URIs. They parse, process, and output strings with no interaction with external systems, networks, or sensitive data. The functions do handle some validation, e.g., is_ipfs_uri checks for proper scheme and CIDv0 format. No malicious or suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are identified. The code appears to be a utility module for data representation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module focused on data formatting and humanization. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed.",
