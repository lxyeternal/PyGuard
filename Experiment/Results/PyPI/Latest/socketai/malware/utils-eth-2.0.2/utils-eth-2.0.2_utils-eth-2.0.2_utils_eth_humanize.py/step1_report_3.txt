{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for humanizing time durations, byte arrays, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences, primarily for display purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (e.g., bytes, strings, integers, URIs) and performs parsing, slicing, and iteration over these inputs.",
  "sinks": "Data is formatted into strings for output; there are no direct sinks that send data elsewhere or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (bytes, strings, integers, URIs) flows through parsing and formatting functions, resulting in human-readable strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. The functions are straightforward and primarily perform formatting and parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of utility functions for formatting durations, byte arrays, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences. It employs safe parsing methods and string manipulations, with no external data fetching or command execution. No use of eval, exec, or other dynamic code execution is present. The code does not interact with environment variables, network sockets, or perform any potentially dangerous operations. All data flows are within controlled transformations. The code appears to be for display and formatting purposes, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions for humanizing data representations. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are identified.",
