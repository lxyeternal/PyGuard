  "purpose": "Utility functions for formatting durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences with validation and human-readable representations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as seconds, bytes, Hash32, URI strings, and integer sequences.",
  "sinks": "None; functions perform validation and formatting without external system interactions or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated and then formatted or truncated; no external data flows or system calls occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; functions are straightforward, perform validation, and do not contain obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for formatting durations, byte arrays, IPFS URIs, and sequences. It performs validation on inputs such as IPFS scheme and CIDv0 hashes, and formats data for display. No external system calls, network interactions, or dynamic code execution are present. The functions are simple, with standard library usage, and do not contain obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The validation routines are appropriate and do not introduce vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is benign and intended for data presentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for formatting and validating data, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
