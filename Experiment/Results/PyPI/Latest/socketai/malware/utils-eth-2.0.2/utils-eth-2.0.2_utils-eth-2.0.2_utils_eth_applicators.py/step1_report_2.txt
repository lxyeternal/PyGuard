{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for applying various formatters and transformations to sequences, dictionaries, and individual values, primarily for data processing and formatting tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters such as lists and dictionaries; accepts functions as input for formatting conditions and operations.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks like network, file, or system commands; no untrusted data is written to external systems within the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatter functions, with potential application of formatting or mapping, and yields transformed data.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of deprecated warnings; no evident obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code; no dynamic code execution or insecure handling of sensitive data is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines formatting and mapping utilities for data structures. It uses safe function calls, does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or system commands. It relies on user-provided functions for formatting, which are invoked directly. No evidence of malicious intent or sabotage was found. Usage of warnings.warn for deprecation is benign. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears clean, structured, and focused on data transformation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, utility functions for data formatting with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It employs standard Python practices, and no malicious payloads or suspicious activity are evident.",
