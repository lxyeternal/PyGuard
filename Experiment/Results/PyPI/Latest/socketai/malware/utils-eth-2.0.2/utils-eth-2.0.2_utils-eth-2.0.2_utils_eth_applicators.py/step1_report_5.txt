  "purpose": "Utility functions for applying various formatters and transformations to lists, dictionaries, and sequences, primarily for data processing and formatting.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters (lists, dicts, values), especially in functions like apply_formatters_to_sequence, apply_formatters_to_dict, apply_formatter_to_array, and apply_key_map.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe code execution if formatters or conditions involve untrusted data; specifically, user-provided formatter functions or conditions could be malicious if they execute arbitrary code. The code itself does not perform network operations, file access, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into formatters or condition functions; these invoke user-defined formatter callables or condition functions; formatted or mapped data flows out. No direct malicious data sinks are evident within this code snippet, but the use of user-provided functions can introduce risks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings.warn for deprecation notices, which is benign. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No dynamic code execution, eval, exec, or similar functions are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious imports. The code relies on external user-defined formatters and conditions, which could be malicious if supplied by an attacker, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple data transformation functions applying formatters to lists, dicts, and sequences. It includes input validation, error handling, and deprecation warnings. No network activity, file operations, or system commands are present. The potential security concern is the execution of user-supplied formatter and condition functions, which could be malicious if those functions are crafted with malicious intent. The code itself appears to be straightforward utility functions without malicious payloads or backdoors. No obfuscated code or hidden logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard utility functions for data formatting with no inherent malicious behavior. The primary risk lies in the execution of external, user-provided callables (formatters and conditions), which could be malicious if supplied untrusted. No malware or security vulnerabilities are directly embedded within this code snippet. Overall, the code seems safe provided that formatter functions are trusted.",
