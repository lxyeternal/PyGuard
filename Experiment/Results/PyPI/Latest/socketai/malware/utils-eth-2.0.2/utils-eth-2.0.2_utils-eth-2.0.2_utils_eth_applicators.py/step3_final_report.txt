{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for data formatting, transformation, and mapping, primarily operating on input data structures such as lists and dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, including input lists and dictionaries, and external formatter or condition callables supplied by users.",
  "sinks": "Internal data transformations; no external data sinks, network activity, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatter functions or key mappings, with external callables executed within the functions.",
  "anomalies": "Accepts user-defined callables (formatters, conditions) which could be malicious if untrusted; no obfuscation or hidden code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for applying formatters, key mappings, and conditional transformations on data structures. It performs input validation, error handling, and deprecation warnings. No malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The primary security consideration is the execution of external callables, which could be malicious if supplied by an untrusted source. The code itself does not perform network operations, system modifications, or contain hidden backdoors. The functions are straightforward, with proper error handling and warnings, indicating safe design. The potential risk arises only if external formatter or condition functions are malicious, which is outside the scope of the code itself but relevant in usage context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security concern is the execution of user-supplied functions, which could be malicious if untrusted. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2 to account for external callable risks. Overall, the code is suitable for use with proper trust in external functions, with no inherent security issues.",
