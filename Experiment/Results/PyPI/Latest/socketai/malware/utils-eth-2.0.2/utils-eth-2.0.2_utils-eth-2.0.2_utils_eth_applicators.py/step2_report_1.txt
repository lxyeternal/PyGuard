  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is safe, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. It performs data transformations, with proper error handling and warnings for deprecation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low)\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code, which is straightforward utility functions. No issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe data processing, no malicious patterns, and standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The functions are purely data transformations with no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; safe, standard utility functions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with deprecation warnings, no malicious code. The only noteworthy aspect is the benign deprecation warning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The deprecation warning is standard; no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The only potential concern is that the functions accept user-defined formatter and condition callables, which could be malicious if untrusted.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** While the code itself is safe, executing untrusted user-provided functions can introduce security risks, such as arbitrary code execution if those functions are malicious. The report correctly notes this potential risk.\n\n**Recommendation:** Given that the code executes external callables, which could be malicious if supplied by an attacker, a higher risk score might be justified. However, since the code itself doesn't perform any malicious activity, and the risk depends on external inputs, a risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** Generally low (0.1), except for Report 5, which correctly notes the potential risk due to user-supplied functions, assigning 0.2. This is reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is primarily utility functions for data transformation.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The only concern is executing user-supplied functions, which could be malicious if those functions are untrusted. The risk score of 0.2 appropriately reflects this potential.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to external callables, which could be malicious if untrusted)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the code analysis. No changes are necessary.",
