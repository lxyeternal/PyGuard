{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for applying various formatters and transformations to data structures such as lists and dictionaries.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments, including lists and dictionaries passed to formatting functions.",
  "sinks": "The code performs transformations on input data, yielding modified lists or dictionaries. No direct data leakage or external data transmission occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Input data (lists/dictionaries) flows into formatting functions, which process and yield transformed data. No external sinks or network calls are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses warnings.warn for a deprecation warning but does not include any suspicious or obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials or malicious backdoors are evident. No code injection, unsafe eval, or dynamic code execution detected. The code relies on standard Python constructs and well-defined decorators/functions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements data transformation utilities using decorators, functional composition, and generators. It performs input validation, such as index bounds and key conflicts, and raises standard exceptions when necessary. No external network calls, file access, or system modifications are present. The usage of warnings and standard exception handling indicates attention to robustness but not malicious intent. The deprecation warning suggests ongoing development or maintenance rather than malicious activity. No suspicious patterns like hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code are identified. The code appears to be safe, standard utility functions for data formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data transformation utilities with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected data manipulations without external effects or suspicious code patterns. Therefore, it is safe for use from a security perspective.",
