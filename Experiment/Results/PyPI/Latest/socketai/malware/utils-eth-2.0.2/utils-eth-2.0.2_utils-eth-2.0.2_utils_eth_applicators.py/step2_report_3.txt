  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides data transformation utilities with proper error handling, no malicious activity, and standard practices like deprecation warnings.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to deprecation warnings, not security concern.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues found. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe data transformations, no external network or system interactions, benign deprecation warning.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on safe data manipulation, no external side effects, proper error handling, and benign warnings.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, no malicious code, standard practices, deprecation warning.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Valid conclusion; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes that execution of user-provided formatter functions could pose a security risk if untrusted, but the code itself does not execute code dynamically.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — acknowledges that if formatter functions are malicious, they could execute arbitrary code, but the code as-is does not do so.\n- **Assessment:** This is a critical point. The core code executes user-supplied callables, which could be malicious if those functions are untrusted. However, the code itself does not contain malicious payloads or dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malware or malicious code:** No, the code does not perform any malicious actions directly.\n- **Execution of user-supplied functions:** Yes, which introduces potential security risks if those functions are malicious. This is a standard consideration in data processing utilities that accept external callables.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No evident vulnerabilities like code injection, backdoors, or secrets.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The malware score should remain at **0** because the code itself is not malicious.\n- The security risk score could be increased slightly (e.g., to 0.2) to reflect that executing untrusted user-defined functions can pose security risks, but this is more about usage context than the code itself.\n- The overall assessment should emphasize that **the core code is safe**, but **the potential security risk depends on the trustworthiness of formatter functions supplied by external callers**.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code present)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (due to potential risks when executing untrusted functions, but not inherent in the code itself)\n\n**This set of utility functions is safe in isolation but should be used with caution if formatter or condition functions are supplied by untrusted sources.**",
