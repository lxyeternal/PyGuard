  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security concern is the execution of user-supplied functions, which could be malicious if untrusted. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2 to account for external callable risks. Overall, the code is suitable for use with proper trust in external functions, with no inherent security issues."
