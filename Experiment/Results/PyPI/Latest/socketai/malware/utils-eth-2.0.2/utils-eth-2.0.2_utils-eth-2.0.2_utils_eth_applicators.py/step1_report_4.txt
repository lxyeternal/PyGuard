{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for applying various formatting and transformation operations to sequences and dictionaries, including applying formatters at specific indices, conditionally applying formatters, and remapping dictionary keys.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'value' (lists or dicts), formatters, condition functions, and key mappings",
  "sinks": "Formatter functions applied to list items or dict values, key remapping, and generator yields",
  "flows": "Input data flows into formatters and key mappings, which are then applied to the data, yielding transformed sequences or dicts",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Use of warnings.warn for deprecation notice is benign; no dynamic code execution, network access, or data exfiltration present",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions for applying formatters and key mappings to sequences and dictionaries. It uses generators, warnings, and decorators for type annotations. No code performs network access, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The functions operate solely on provided data structures. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present. The only noteworthy aspect is the deprecation warning, which is a standard practice and not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward utility functions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains utility functions for data formatting and transformation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable aspect is the deprecation warning, which is benign. No malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
