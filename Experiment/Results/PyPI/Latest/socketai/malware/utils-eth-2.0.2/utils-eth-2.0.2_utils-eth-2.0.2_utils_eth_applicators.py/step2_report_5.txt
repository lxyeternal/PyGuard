  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides utility functions for data formatting and mapping, with proper error handling, no suspicious patterns, no malicious code, and standard practices such as warnings.warn for deprecation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with safe data processing.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes safe data transformations, no network or system operations, benign deprecation warnings.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on safe data utilities, proper validation, no external effects, no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with deprecation warning, no malicious activity, operates solely on input data.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes that execution of user-provided formatter functions could be a potential security concern, but emphasizes that the code itself is safe; the primary risk is if external callables are malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no code injection or malicious code within the provided functions.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — slightly higher, acknowledging that if formatter functions are untrusted, they could be malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is cautious and correct. The core functions are safe, but execution of external callables is a potential vector if those are malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily data transformation utilities with no inherent malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or network activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk Scores:** Mostly 0.1, with Report 5 at 0.2 due to the potential risk if external functions are malicious. This is a reasonable and cautious stance.\n- **Scores Justification:** The scores are consistent with the analysis. The only caveat is the execution of user-supplied functions, which could be malicious if untrusted, justifying a slightly higher risk score in Report 5.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjustments:** The scores are reasonable. No need for significant changes.\n- **Potential Hidden Risks:** The only concern is the execution of external, user-defined formatter functions. If these are untrusted, they could execute malicious code. However, the core code does not contain such code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (acknowledging potential risk if external functions are malicious)\n\nThis aligns with the overall safe nature of the code, with a prudent note about external callables.\n\n---\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' assessments.** The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious activity. The only caveat is the reliance on external functions, which is a common pattern in data processing utilities but warrants caution if those functions are untrusted.",
