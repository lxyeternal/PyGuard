{
  "purpose": "The code provides various utility functions for applying formatters, key mappings, and conditional transformations to data structures such as lists and dictionaries.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (lists, dicts, values) and possibly external modules like decorators, functional, and toolz libraries, which are not detailed here.",
  "sinks": "The functions process data locally within generators and functions, yielding transformed data; no external data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are directly present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatter functions, conditionals, and mapping operations, then yields transformed data. No external or untrusted sources are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses warnings.warn for deprecation notices, which is standard. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for applying various formatting and mapping transformations on lists and dictionaries, with proper error handling for index and type errors. It uses decorators and external functions that are not detailed but appear to serve type annotation or conversion purposes. There is a deprecation warning indicating planned removal of a function, which is standard practice. The code operates solely on data provided as function arguments, with no evidence of malicious data exfiltration, network activity, or system manipulation. Overall, the code performs safe data processing tasks without any signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a set of safe utility functions for data transformation and formatting. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. The presence of standard error handling and warnings further suggests legitimate, non-malicious intent.",
