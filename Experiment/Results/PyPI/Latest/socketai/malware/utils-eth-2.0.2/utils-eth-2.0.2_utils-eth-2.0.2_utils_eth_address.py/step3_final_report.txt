  "purpose": "Ethereum address validation, normalization, and checksum formatting utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input data from user-provided addresses in text, bytes, or address objects.",
  "sinks": "Address validation routines, cryptographic hash computations for checksum, string formatting.",
  "flows": "Input addresses are validated, potentially converted to normalized form, then used to generate checksums via keccak hash, and formatted with or without checksum casing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard address validation techniques, regex for hex address pattern matching, cryptographic keccak hashing for checksum creation, and type checks for address formats. No network, file I/O, or dynamic code execution present. The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and align with Ethereum address standards. No anomalies or suspicious patterns identified. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Ethereum address utility module with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned across reports are accurate and appropriate given the code's functionality.",
