  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling, validating, normalizing, and converting Ethereum addresses in various formats.",
  "sources": "Functions that read input data include parameter values of address in functions like is_hex_address, is_binary_address, is_address, to_normalized_address, to_canonical_address, is_canonical_address, is_same_address, to_checksum_address, and is_checksum_address.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; however, functions like keccak (used for hashing in to_checksum_address) process data that could potentially be influenced by untrusted input, but here it is used in a cryptographic context without external data transmission or unsafe execution.",
  "flows": "Input data from function parameters flows through validation functions, normalization, and cryptographic hashing (keccak) to generate checksum addresses. The flow from input to cryptographic processing is standard for address validation and checksum generation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Regular use of regex for address validation, standard normalization, and checksum computation. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements address validation, normalization, and checksum formatting for Ethereum addresses using standard cryptographic hashing (keccak). It uses regex for hex address validation, proper type checks, and standard address conversions. The functions do not perform network operations, file I/O, or data exfiltration. All cryptographic operations (keccak) are consistent with Ethereum address checksum computations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leaks, backdoors, or malicious code injections. The code appears well-structured and focused solely on address handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate Ethereum address validation and formatting tasks with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It contains no backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious side effects. All cryptographic and validation procedures are standard for blockchain address handling.",
