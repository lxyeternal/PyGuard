{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import various utility functions from the 'cytoolz' library, with a fallback to 'toolz' if 'cytoolz' is not available. The purpose appears to be to use functional programming utilities for data processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from external libraries ('cytoolz' or 'toolz') during import statements.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks, network calls, or data leak points; it only performs imports.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the library imports into the current namespace. There are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted input or data manipulation beyond imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is heavily focused on importing a large number of functions from either 'cytoolz' or 'toolz'. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are evident. The fallback import pattern is common and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a conditional import to include utility functions from 'cytoolz' or 'toolz'. It is purely import logic with no runtime execution of code beyond module loading. There are no indications of data handling, network activity, or malicious intent. The structure is typical for conditional dependency loading, which is common in open-source projects. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely responsible for importing utility functions for later use. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It appears to be standard dependency handling code with no suspicious elements.",
