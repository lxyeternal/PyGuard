  "purpose": "Conditional import of utility functions from 'cytoolz' with fallback to 'toolz'.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'cytoolz' or 'toolz'.",
  "sinks": "None; static imports without data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only import statements establishing dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward fallback pattern, no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard try-except import pattern to load numerous utility functions from 'cytoolz' with a fallback to 'toolz'. Both are open-source libraries for functional programming in Python. The import statements are explicit, static, and do not involve dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The large number of imports is unusual but not malicious, possibly indicating extensive utility usage. No signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard dependency setup for utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward implementation.",
