{
  "purpose": "The code aims to import a comprehensive set of functions from either the 'cytoolz' or 'toolz' library, which are used for functional programming and data manipulation in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the Python environment by attempting to import modules; specifically, it reads the module names 'cytoolz' and 'toolz'.",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not perform any data processing or untrusted data handling; it only imports functions. There are no sinks for untrusted data or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: it attempts to import multiple functions from 'cytoolz', and if that fails, from 'toolz'. There are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code is a standard pattern for conditional imports with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure is a standard try-except import fallback pattern to support both 'cytoolz' and 'toolz' libraries. It only imports numerous functions related to functional programming. No data processing, network activity, or system modification occurs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs are present. The code is purely for importing modules, which is common and benign. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with a fallback mechanism for two similar libraries. It does not contain any malicious code or security issues. It appears safe and intended for utility functions related to data manipulation.",
