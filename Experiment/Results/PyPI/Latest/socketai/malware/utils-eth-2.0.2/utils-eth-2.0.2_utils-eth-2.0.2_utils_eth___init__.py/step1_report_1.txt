{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python utility library ('utils-eth') that provides various helper functions and imports related to Ethereum development and data handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (abi, address, applicators, conversions, crypto, currency, decorators, encoding, exceptions, functional, hexadecimal, humanize, logging, module_loading, numeric, types), and system information via sys and pkg_resources.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks or data outputs, network calls, or handling of untrusted input/output in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code initializes the library, imports various modules and functions, and sets a deprecation warning if running on Python 2. No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code mostly consists of imports, module setup, and a deprecation warning. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple internal modules and functions, sets a deprecation warning for Python 2, and retrieves package version info. All actions are typical for a utility library. No external network calls, data handling, or risky operations are present. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are detected. The presence of numerous import statements suggests modular design rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a utility library with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It only imports functions and modules, and issues a deprecation warning for old Python versions. There are no suspicious behaviors or malicious code segments.",
