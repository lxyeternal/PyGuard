{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a setup and import module for an Ethereum utility library, importing various internal functions and classes, issuing a deprecation warning for Python 2, and retrieving package version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata via pkg_resources, system version info via sys.version_info, and issues a warning through warnings module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted input or produce output effects.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, issuing a deprecation warning if on Python 2, and fetching package version; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with standard import statements and a deprecation warning.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup script importing internal modules related to Ethereum operations, issuing a standard deprecation warning for Python 2, and retrieving package version info. No network calls, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The deprecation warning is routine, and the version fetch is standard. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident. The structure is typical for a utility library initialization, with no external data handling or dynamic behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions as a standard setup module for an Ethereum utility library. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified and appropriate.",
