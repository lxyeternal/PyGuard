  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "This code defines a custom exception class 'ValidationError' inheriting from Exception with a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no inputs, data handling, or suspicious behaviors. The code is minimal and appears to be a standard practice for custom exceptions. No embedded or hidden malicious code, obfuscated elements, or malicious intent are present. It solely establishes a specific exception type for validation errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard definition of a custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
