  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception (`ValidationError`) inheriting from `Exception`. The code only contains a class with a docstring and a `pass` statement, with no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code.  \n- They also correctly state that there are no data flows, inputs, outputs, or external dependencies.  \n- No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in these evaluations.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which aligns with the code's benign nature.  \n- `obfuscated: 0` is appropriate, given the straightforward, readable class definition.  \n- `securityRisk: 0` is justified because the code does not perform any risky operations or handle sensitive data.  \n- The high confidence (`1`) across all reports is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct. The code is purely definitional and does not pose any security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n- All reports correctly assign `malware: 0`. The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing code dynamically, network communication, or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all recognize the code's simplicity and benign intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk present)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python.  \n- There is no indication of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign, minimal class definition for a custom exception, with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My estimated scores**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0",
