  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors in Python.",
  "sources": "Class definition, specifically the class name, docstring, and the pass statement.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external dependencies, or dynamic code execution; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class with no suspicious features or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard custom exception class inheriting from Exception, containing only a docstring and a pass statement. It does not perform any data handling, external communication, or dynamic execution. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with full confidence. The code's simplicity and clarity support these assessments, and no logical flaws or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
