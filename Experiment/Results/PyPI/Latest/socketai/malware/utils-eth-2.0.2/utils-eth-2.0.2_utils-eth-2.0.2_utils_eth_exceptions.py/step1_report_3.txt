  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or output occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and minimal; no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a custom exception class inheriting from Python's Exception. There are no input/output operations, no third-party library usage, and no dynamic or obfuscated code. It serves as a custom error type for validation logic elsewhere. No malicious behavior or security risks are detectable within this small, isolated snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign definition of a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
