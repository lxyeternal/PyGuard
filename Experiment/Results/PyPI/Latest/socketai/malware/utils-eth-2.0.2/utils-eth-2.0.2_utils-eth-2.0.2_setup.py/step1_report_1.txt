  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'utils-eth', including dependencies, metadata, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools, defining dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no runtime execution of untrusted data or code.",
  "flows": "Reading long description from README.md -> setup() function for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or unusual logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs static package setup tasks, reading a README file and defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All dependencies are version-restricted, with no indication of malicious external code or network activity. No code injection, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The use of 'with open' is standard and controlled. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It adheres to best practices for package configuration without any suspicious elements.",
