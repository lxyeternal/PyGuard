  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, defining dependencies, metadata, and reading a README file for description.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, defining dependencies and package metadata",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed in a way that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setting package metadata and dependencies -> executing setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and follows standard packaging practices",
  "analysis": "The script performs static configuration tasks for packaging, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling. Dependencies are version-restricted and standard. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. All signals indicate benign behavior. The code is a typical setup.py file used in Python projects, with no malicious or security-compromising elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The provided reports correctly identify its safe nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No improvements or changes are necessary.",
