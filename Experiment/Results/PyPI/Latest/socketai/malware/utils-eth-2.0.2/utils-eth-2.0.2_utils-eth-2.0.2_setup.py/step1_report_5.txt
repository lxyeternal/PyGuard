{
  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'utils-eth', including dependencies, package data, metadata, and package discovery instructions.",
  "sources": "File reading operation (open('./README.md')) for long description content",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or actions that could lead to data leaks or security issues",
  "flows": "Reading README.md file to assign long_description variable, then passing setup parameters for packaging",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of standard packaging tools and conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for packaging Python projects. It imports setup functions from setuptools, defines dependencies, reads the README.md file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata. The dependencies include version constraints, and there is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden operations. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution with specified dependencies and metadata.",
