{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'utils-eth' used to distribute utility functions related to Ethereum.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, package metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; no external data or input processing beyond file reading.",
  "flows": "Reads package metadata and dependencies from static source, then proceeds to package setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools procedures to define package metadata, dependencies, and extras. It reads a local README file for long description, specifies dependencies with version constraints, and configures package discovery. No user input handling, network activity, or executable code that could be malicious. The code is consistent with typical package setup scripts and contains no anomalies indicative of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
