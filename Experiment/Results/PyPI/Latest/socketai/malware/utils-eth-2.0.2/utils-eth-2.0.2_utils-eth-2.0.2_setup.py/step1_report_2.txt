  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the 'utils-eth' Python package, defining dependencies, package data, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, importing setuptools functions, defining dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script primarily reads static files and defines package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> assigns long_description; defines dependencies and package info -> passes data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard setup.py structure. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks, including reading a README file, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata. It employs conditional dependency specifications and dynamically combines extra requirements, all of which are standard practices. The code does not contain any code injection points, network activity, or other malicious behavior. It does not use any obfuscated code, and there are no hidden or suspicious code patterns. The only file read is the README.md for the long description, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use and contains no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
