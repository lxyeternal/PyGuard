  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe code that only assigns a version string to a variable (`__version__`) and contain licensing comments.\n- There are no data inputs, outputs, data flows, or executable logic.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code features are identified.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are minimal, standard boilerplate for package version declaration.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or signs of malicious activity are present.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and non-malicious.\n\n**Potential issues or improvements:**\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no score adjustments are necessary.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as no malicious behavior is present.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, as the code is straightforward and human-readable.\n- The security risk score remains at 0, given the lack of any security-related issues.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The provided code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on these reports.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: the code is just a version declaration with license comments, typical of open-source packages, and contains no security issues.",
