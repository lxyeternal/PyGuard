  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A, the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment with licensing information, a copyright notice, and a variable assignment setting the __version__ attribute to a string '0.1.11a2'. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external sinks, and no suspicious behaviors observed. The version string appears to follow semantic versioning conventions for alpha releases. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated content are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended only to specify the version of the software package. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment.",
