  "purpose": "This code declares a package version string with licensing comments, serving as metadata for the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only contains comments and a simple assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is static and contains only a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only comments and a straightforward version assignment; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of license comments and a version string assignment. It lacks executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
