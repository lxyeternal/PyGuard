  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Logic**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of comments, license notices, and a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no input/output operations, data flows, or executable logic. The code is static and minimal.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n   - No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated content is detected.\n   - No anomalies or deviations from standard boilerplate code are identified.\n   - The code serves only as metadata, which is common in open-source packages.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - All reports assign `malware`, `obfuscated`, and `securityRisk` scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.\n   - The rationale provided in each report aligns with the actual code content.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:  \n   - Since the code is purely static and contains no dynamic or executable elements, there's no basis for assigning any risk or malware scores above 0.\n   - The reports are consistent and do not make unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:  \n   - The code is entirely benign.\n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nBased on all the reports and the code snippet, I agree with the current scores:  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate**:  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns.",
