  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code is purely comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments, with no executable code, data input/output, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of these comments, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code does not contain any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign licensing comments with no security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or re-scoring is necessary.",
