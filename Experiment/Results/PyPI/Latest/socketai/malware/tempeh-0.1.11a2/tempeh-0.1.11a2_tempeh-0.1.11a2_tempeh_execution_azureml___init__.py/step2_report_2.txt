  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code snippet contains only licensing comments, with no executable code, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - There are no sources, sinks, or data flows to analyze.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscation are identified.\n   - All reports agree that this snippet is harmless and contains no security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of executable code and malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the nature of the snippet.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code contains only licensing comments, the risk score of 0 is justified.\n   - Malware score of 0 is also justified; no malicious activity is present or implied.\n   - The reports do not overstate the risk or malware potential.\n\n5. **Claims About Potential Vulnerabilities:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly conclude that there's no vulnerability or malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no security risk)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- Given the nature of the snippet, these scores are appropriate.\n- There is no need to increase any scores; the reports are accurate.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports correctly identify that this is a benign licensing comment block with no security concerns. The scores are justified and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo changes needed.",
