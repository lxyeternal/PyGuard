{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of Keras model wrappers and functions for creating neural network models for classification and regression tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from dataset objects (_X_train, _y_train), and from the numpy library for data handling.",
  "sinks": "The code performs model training using model.fit() with dataset inputs; no external data sinks or untrusted output generation is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset inputs into model creation functions, then into model.fit() for training. No data flows into external systems or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. Logging suppression and import handling are standard. No hidden or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, suppresses tensorflow logs, and defines model wrapper classes for Keras models. It creates simple neural network architectures for classification and regression tasks, using standard Keras functions. Model training involves straightforward calls to model.fit() with provided datasets, and no external or untrusted data sources are used. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The only notable aspect is the suppression of stderr during import, which is a common technique to hide verbose library logs but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of neural network model wrappers and creation functions for machine learning tasks, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
