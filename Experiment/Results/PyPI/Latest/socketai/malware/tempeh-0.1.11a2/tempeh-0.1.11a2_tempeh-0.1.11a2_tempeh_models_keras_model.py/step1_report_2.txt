{
  "purpose": "Defines wrapper classes and functions for creating and training Keras deep neural network models for classification and regression tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports modules like keras, tensorflow, numpy, os, sys; reads dataset attributes such as size and task; uses dataset training data (_X_train, _y_train); reads environment variables (via sys.stderr redirection).",
  "sinks": "Model creation functions (create_keras_regressor, create_keras_classifier, create_keras_multiclass_classifier) that perform model training with dataset inputs; uses keras functions for loss, optimizer, metrics; converts labels to categorical; fits models on dataset.",
  "flows": "Source: dataset attributes and training data → Model creation functions → Model training calls → keras library functions for loss, optimizer, metrics, and fitting.",
  "anomalies": "Redirection of sys.stderr to suppress tensorflow messages is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity observed; model training is straightforward; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present; no external network calls or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily creates and trains Keras models for different tasks, using standard libraries and practices. The suppression of stderr during import might obscure diagnostic messages but is not inherently malicious. Model training functions utilize dataset attributes and standard keras APIs. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code is detected. Overall, the code appears to be a standard implementation of Keras model wrappers with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of Keras model wrappers for classification and regression tasks. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The suppression of stderr may hide some warnings but is not malicious. Overall, the package appears safe.",
