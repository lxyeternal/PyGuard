  "purpose": "Defines Keras model wrappers for classification and regression tasks, facilitating model creation, training, and compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "Dataset attributes (_X_train, _y_train), dataset size, and input features during model creation functions.",
  "sinks": "Model training via model.fit with dataset data; no external or untrusted data flows or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data from dataset attributes flows into model.fit during model creation functions.",
  "anomalies": "Suppression of sys.stderr to hide tensorflow/keras logs; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Keras model wrappers with routine dataset handling and model training. No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. The stderr suppression is a minor logging choice, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The code is straightforward, with typical ML routines and no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of Keras model wrappers for classification and regression tasks. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The minor stderr suppression does not constitute malicious behavior.",
