{
  "purpose": "Defines wrapper classes and functions to create, compile, and train Keras deep learning models for classification and regression tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (numpy, os, sys), third-party keras and tensorflow modules, and data from dataset objects.",
  "sinks": "Model creation and training functions use untrusted data (X, y) directly in model.fit(), but this is expected for ML training. No other data sinks or external connections observed.",
  "flows": "Data from dataset (_X_train, _y_train) flows into model creation functions, then into model.fit() for training.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code mainly performs standard model setup and training.",
  "analysis": "The code loads keras and tensorflow modules, suppresses stderr during import, and defines model wrapper classes for different ML tasks. Model creation functions generate models with standard layers, compile with typical loss functions, and train with provided datasets. No obfuscated code, external network connections, or data exfiltration methods are present. The data handling appears standard for ML workflows. Overall, the code performs expected model training routines without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Keras model wrappers and training functions for classification and regression tasks. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks, only routine ML model setup and training steps.",
