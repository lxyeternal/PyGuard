{
  "purpose": "Defines wrapper classes for Keras models (regressor, binary classifier, multiclass classifier) and functions to create simple neural network models for training on datasets.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (keras, tensorflow, numpy, os, sys); access to dataset attributes (dataset._X_train, dataset._y_train); use of dataset.size for compatibility checks.",
  "sinks": "Model training functions calling model.fit with dataset data; use of keras.utils.to_categorical for labels.",
  "flows": "Dataset data flows from dataset._X_train and dataset._y_train to model.fit; dataset.size used in compatibility checks.",
  "anomalies": "None detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No unusual code or obfuscated code is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up neural network models for training purposes, with functions for creating regression and classification models. It handles dataset compatibility, model configuration, and training. All library imports are standard for machine learning tasks, and no external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as code injection, data theft, or hidden backdoors are apparent. The code appears to be a standard implementation for model setup and training with Keras.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of neural network wrappers and model creation functions. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
