  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate Azure ML utility with no malware or obfuscation. The primary security issue is logging sensitive info, which should be addressed. Scores assigned are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is low (~0.2), mainly due to info leakage. Slightly increasing the security risk score to 0.3 could better reflect the exposure of credentials in logs."
