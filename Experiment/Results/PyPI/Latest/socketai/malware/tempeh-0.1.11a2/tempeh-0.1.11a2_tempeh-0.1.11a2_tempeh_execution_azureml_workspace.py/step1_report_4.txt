  "purpose": "Utilities for managing Azure Machine Learning workspace and related resources.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., VARIABLE_NAME_TENANT_ID, VARIABLE_NAME_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID, etc.), os.getenv() calls.",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks or malicious actions directly; potential risk if environment variables are compromised.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read (sources), used for authentication and resource configuration, but no dangerous data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "Use of getenv() with nested getenv() calls (e.g., os.getenv(os.getenv(...))) could be problematic if environment variables are unset, leading to potential errors but not malicious intent. The print(SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID) may expose sensitive data in logs if not properly managed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads sensitive credentials from environment variables, which is standard for cloud operations, but it exposes the SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID via print(), risking credential leakage if logs are not secured. No other suspicious or malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration observed. The flow from environment variables to Azure SDK calls is typical for cloud resource provisioning. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Azure ML workspace setup utility with a potential security concern: printing a service principal ID could leak sensitive information. No malicious behavior or malware present. Overall, the code appears legitimate, with a low likelihood of malicious intent but a caution regarding logging sensitive info.",
