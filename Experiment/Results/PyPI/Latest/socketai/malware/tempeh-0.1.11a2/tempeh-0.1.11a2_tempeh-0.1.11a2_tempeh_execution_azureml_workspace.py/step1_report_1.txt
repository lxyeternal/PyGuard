  "purpose": "Utilities for managing an Azure Machine Learning workspace, including resource group and workspace creation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.getenv), hardcoded strings, and imported modules",
  "sinks": "Logging functions (logger.info), print statement, and environment variable usage",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and used to authenticate and configure Azure resources; logging occurs at various steps",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.getenv() with nested getenv() calls for variable names is unusual; print statement exposes service principal ID; reliance on environment variables without validation; no explicit input validation or error handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages Azure ML resources by reading environment variables for sensitive credentials and configurations. The code uses standard Azure SDK functions to create or verify resource groups and workspaces. The print statement exposing the service principal ID is a privacy concern but not malicious per se. The nested getenv calls for variable names may cause runtime issues if not properly configured but do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code does not execute any external commands or handle untrusted input in a dangerous way.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility script for Azure ML workspace setup with no evident malicious behavior. The only concern is the exposure of sensitive information via print and the handling of environment variables without validation, but these are security best practices violations rather than malicious actions.",
