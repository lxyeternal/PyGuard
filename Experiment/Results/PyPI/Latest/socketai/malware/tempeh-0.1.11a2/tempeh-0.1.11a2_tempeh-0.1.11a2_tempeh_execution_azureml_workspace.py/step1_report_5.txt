  "purpose": "Utilities to authenticate and set up an Azure Machine Learning workspace and associated resources.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.getenv) for credentials and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; code primarily performs resource creation and authentication.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → Authentication objects and resource management functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The use of environment variables for sensitive data is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code authenticates to Azure using service principal credentials fetched from environment variables, then ensures the existence of a resource group and a workspace, creating them if necessary. It uses standard Azure SDK methods and does not perform any network communication beyond Azure API calls. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is well-structured for resource provisioning with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation for Azure resource setup and authentication. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks beyond standard credential handling practices. The use of environment variables for credentials is common, and no malicious code or backdoors are evident.",
