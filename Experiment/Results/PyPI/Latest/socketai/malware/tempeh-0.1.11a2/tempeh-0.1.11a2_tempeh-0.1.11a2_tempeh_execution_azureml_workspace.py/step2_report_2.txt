  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a utility for managing Azure ML resources, including resource groups and workspaces.\n- They note the use of environment variables for credentials and configuration, which is standard practice.\n- Common concerns include:\n  - Printing sensitive info such as SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID, risking credential exposure.\n  - Use of nested getenv() calls, which could cause runtime errors if environment variables are missing.\n- None of the reports identify malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to logging sensitive info and potential misconfiguration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **No malicious code or malware present.**\n- **Use of environment variables for sensitive data** is standard but carries risk if logs are accessible.\n- **Printing SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID** exposes sensitive info, which is a security concern but not malicious.\n- **Nested getenv() calls** may cause runtime errors but are not malicious.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Print statement exposing SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID**: a privacy/security violation.\n- **Nested getenv() calls**: could lead to errors if environment variables are unset.\n- **Lack of input validation or error handling**: the code assumes environment variables are set correctly.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware score (0)** is appropriate; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score (0)** is appropriate; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score (~0.2)** seems reasonable, considering the exposure of sensitive info via print and potential runtime errors.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The **risk score** should remain low but acknowledge the security concern of logging sensitive info.\n- The **malware score** remains at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** stays at 0, given code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Reduce the security risk score slightly** if possible, due to the print statement exposing sensitive info.\n- **No change needed for malware or obfuscated scores.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to logging sensitive info and potential runtime errors)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the reports' consensus and the code's actual behavior. The primary concern is the exposure of credentials in logs, which should be addressed but does not constitute malicious activity.",
