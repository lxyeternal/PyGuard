  "sources": "Environment variables: VARIABLE_NAME_TENANT_ID, VARIABLE_NAME_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID, VARIABLE_NAME_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD, SUBSCRIPTION_ID, RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME, WORKSPACE_NAME, WORKSPACE_LOCATION",
  "sinks": "Usage of environment variables for authentication credentials and resource identifiers; creation of resource group and workspace using Azure SDK",
  "flows": "Environment variables (sources) provide credentials and configuration data to authentication and resource creation functions (sinks)",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for sensitive data; print statement exposing SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID; no hardcoded secrets, but sensitive data is handled via env vars which could be misconfigured",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves credentials from environment variables, avoiding hardcoding secrets. The only potential concern is the print statement exposing SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID, which could leak sensitive info if logs are accessible. Otherwise, the code performs standard resource management and workspace provisioning using Azure SDK without suspicious logic or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing Azure ML workspaces with no malicious intent. The only minor concern is the print statement revealing SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID, which could lead to credential exposure if logs are compromised. Overall, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
