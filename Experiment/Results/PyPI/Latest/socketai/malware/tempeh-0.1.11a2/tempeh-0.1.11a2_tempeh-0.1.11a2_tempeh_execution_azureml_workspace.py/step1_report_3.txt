  "purpose": "Utility script to authenticate with Azure Machine Learning, manage resource groups, and create or access a workspace for performance tracking.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for credentials and configuration (e.g., VARIABLE_NAME_TENANT_ID, VARIABLE_NAME_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID, VARIABLE_NAME_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD, SUBSCRIPTION_ID, RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME, WORKSPACE_NAME, WORKSPACE_LOCATION).",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK calls that perform resource management and workspace creation, which could potentially modify cloud resources.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources, used in authentication and resource creation functions, resulting in cloud resource management actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads sensitive credentials (tenant ID, service principal ID, password) from environment variables which are dynamically looked up; no hardcoded secrets. The script logs the service principal ID and performs resource creation without obvious malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles cloud resource management tasks such as authenticating via service principal, ensuring resource groups exist, and creating or accessing a workspace. It uses environment variables for sensitive data, avoiding hardcoded secrets, which is a good security practice. The code leverages standard Azure SDK functions for resource management and workspace setup. No suspicious network activities, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system modifications are evident. The code's purpose is administrative and cloud resource management, aligned with legitimate use cases. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware, and no obfuscated code or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing Azure ML workspaces and resource groups, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or malware. It follows standard practices for credential management and cloud resource handling. Overall, it poses no significant security threat based on the provided code.",
