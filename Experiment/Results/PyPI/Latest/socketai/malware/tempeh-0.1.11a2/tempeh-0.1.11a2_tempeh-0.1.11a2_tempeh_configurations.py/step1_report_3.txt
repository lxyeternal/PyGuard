{
  "purpose": "Defines and imports datasets and models for automatic enqueuing and training in a machine learning framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'tempeh.datasets', 'tempeh.models', and 'tempeh.constants'. Dataset class generation calls such as 'generate_dataset_class' with dataset names and sizes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data, no functions executing external commands, no network operations, no code evaluating untrusted input, no system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset generation functions to dataset instances; model classes are mapped directly to identifiers. No runtime data processing or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No obfuscated or dynamically executed code observed. The code primarily consists of imports, dataset/model mappings, and class generation calls.",
  "analysis": "The code imports dataset and model classes from a library called 'tempeh', then constructs dictionaries mapping string keys to dataset instances generated via static method calls and to model class wrappers. These generate dataset objects based on dataset names and sizes without any dynamic or untrusted input. The code appears to be configuration/setup code for a machine learning pipeline, with no external data input, command execution, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward setup for datasets and models without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or security risks are present. The code serves as configuration or initialization code for a larger system.",
