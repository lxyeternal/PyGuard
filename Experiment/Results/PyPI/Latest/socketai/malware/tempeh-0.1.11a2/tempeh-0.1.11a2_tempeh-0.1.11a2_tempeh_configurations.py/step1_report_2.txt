{
  "purpose": "Defines datasets and models for automatic enqueuing in a machine learning pipeline.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'tempeh' package, dataset generation functions, and constants.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly sends data over networks or writes sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data is generated through dataset classes and assigned to variables; no untrusted data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. Usage of dataset generation methods is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports dataset and model classes, generates datasets with predefined parameters, and maps models to identifiers. There are no inputs from external sources, user inputs, or untrusted data handling. No suspicious functions, network activity, or file operations are present. The code is straightforward and appears to be a typical setup script for ML workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for dataset/model configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, suspicious flows, or anomalies.",
