{
  "purpose": "Static setup script importing dataset and model classes, generating datasets with fixed parameters, and mapping models for a machine learning pipeline.",
  "sources": "Import statements, static function calls to generate datasets, direct class references for models",
  "sinks": "None; no external data output, network activity, or dynamic code execution",
  "flows": "Static data flow from fixed strings/constants to dataset generation functions, with direct class references for models",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static configuration module importing known classes, generating datasets with fixed parameters, and mapping models. No dynamic inputs, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The dataset generation functions are called with static strings and constants, indicating data loading from trusted sources. The code does not perform any operations that could lead to malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The structure and content are typical for ML pipeline setup scripts, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and free of malicious behavior or security risks. All indicators suggest it is a standard configuration script for datasets and models in a machine learning context. No adjustments to malware, obfuscation, or risk scores are necessary.",
