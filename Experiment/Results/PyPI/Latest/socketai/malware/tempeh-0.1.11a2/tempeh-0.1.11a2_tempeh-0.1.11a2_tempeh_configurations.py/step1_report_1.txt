{
  "purpose": "Defines datasets and models for automatic enqueuing in a machine learning framework, primarily importing classes and generating dataset instances.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'tempeh.datasets', 'tempeh.models', and 'tempeh.constants'; dataset generation functions called with static strings and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data processing, network operations, or file handling. No user input or external data sources are used.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; dataset class generation uses fixed strings and constants, and model classes are referenced directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code consists of static imports, dataset instantiations, and class references, with no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules from a known package 'tempeh' and generates dataset classes with static dataset names, using constants for dataset sizes. Model classes are referenced directly without dynamic or external input. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors. The structure appears standard for a dataset/model registry in a machine learning context. No signs of malware, code injection, or malicious behavior are present. The code lacks any dynamic code execution, obfuscated segments, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward dataset and model registry, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It utilizes static references and well-defined classes, posing no threat in a supply chain security context.",
