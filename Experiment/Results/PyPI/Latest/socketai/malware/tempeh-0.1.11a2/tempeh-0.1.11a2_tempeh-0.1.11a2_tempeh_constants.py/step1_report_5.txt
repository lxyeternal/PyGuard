{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants and class variables for a performance testing framework related to machine learning models and datasets.",
  "sources": "Constants definitions, class attributes, and dataset name assignments.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets static constant values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant and class attribute definitions for use within a framework. No input handling, data processing, or external data interaction is present. The dataset names and parameters are hardcoded as strings and numerical values, with no indication of malicious intent. The structure is straightforward and intended for configuration purposes. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of constants and configuration variables for a machine learning performance testing framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
