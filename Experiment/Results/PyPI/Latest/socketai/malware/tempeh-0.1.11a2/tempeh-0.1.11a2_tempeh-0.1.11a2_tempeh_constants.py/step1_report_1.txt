  "purpose": "Define constants and class variables for use in a machine learning performance testing framework.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; all data are static string constants and class variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data manipulation or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class and variable definitions for constants used in a performance testing framework. There are no functions, data processing, input handling, or external communication. All variables are static string or numeric values intended for configuration purposes. The structure is straightforward, and there are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign collection of constants and configuration parameters for a machine learning framework. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
