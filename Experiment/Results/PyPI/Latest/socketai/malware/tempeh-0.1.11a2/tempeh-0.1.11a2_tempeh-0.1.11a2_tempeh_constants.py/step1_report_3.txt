{
  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters for a machine learning performance testing framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all constants are hardcoded within the class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code solely defines static constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving untrusted data; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; all code consists of straightforward class attribute assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of static class definitions setting constant values for data types, algorithms, tasks, metrics, timing, model parameters, datasets, and related constants. There are no input reading, data processing, or dynamic code execution elements. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or potential injection points are present. The code is purely declarative and intended for configuration purposes. No signs of obfuscated, malicious, or harmful code are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of constant definitions used in a machine learning framework. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign configuration module.",
