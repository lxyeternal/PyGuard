  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as static class and variable definitions, serving as configuration constants.\n- No input/output operations, dynamic code execution, or data processing are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external dependencies or network interactions.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, and no security risks are identified.\n\n**Confirmation of Issues:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns.\n- The structure is purely declarative, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- No evidence suggests any issues with the code's logic or reasoning.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The confidence levels are appropriately high (all at 1).\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** All assign 0, justified because the code is purely configuration with no security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential for Higher Risk Scores?**\n- No, since there's no evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n**Challenging Assumptions:**\n- The reports assume the code is purely static configuration, which appears correct.\n- No hidden behaviors or dynamic code execution are suggested or evident.\n\n**Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a benign, static collection of constants for a machine learning framework. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and align with the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is entirely safe and serves a configuration purpose. No further action or concern is warranted based on this review.",
