{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants and class variables for a machine learning performance testing framework.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading sources; primarily static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only provides constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with string constants representing dataset names, algorithm types, metrics, parameters, and other configuration values. All elements are static and do not perform any input/output operations, data processing, or network communication. There is no evidence of malicious intent, code injection, or suspicious behavior. The content appears to be a straightforward set of configuration constants used for machine learning performance testing, and no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a collection of configuration constants for a performance testing framework. There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated elements detected.",
