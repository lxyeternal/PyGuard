{
  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters for a machine learning performance testing framework.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data are static class variables or string constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. All values are static and related to configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class definitions with string constants and numerical configuration values used in machine learning tasks. No dynamic code execution, external data reading, or untrusted inputs are present. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns identified. It appears to be a straightforward configuration module intended for use within a larger framework.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is safe, contains no malicious intent, and has no security risks. It solely defines constants for a machine learning performance testing framework.",
