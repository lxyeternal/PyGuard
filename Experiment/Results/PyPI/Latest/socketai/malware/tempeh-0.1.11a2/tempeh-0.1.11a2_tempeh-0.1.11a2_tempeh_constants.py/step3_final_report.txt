{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and configuration parameters for a machine learning performance testing framework.",
  "sources": "Static class variables and string constants used for configuration; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks; no sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with string constants and numerical parameters, serving as configuration. There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward and static, with no external dependencies or network interactions. All security-related scores are zero, indicating no risks or malware. The structure and content are benign and appropriate for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The security assessment is that it poses no threat, and the scores are accurate and justified.",
