  "purpose": "Configure an Azure ML environment by loading requirements, optionally adding a private pip wheel, installing 'azureml-sdk', and enabling Docker for deployment.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt', optional private pip wheel file, environment setup functions",
  "sinks": "Potentially the private pip wheel if malicious, but no actual data leaks or network activity in code",
  "flows": "Loading requirements -> adding private wheel (if provided) -> installing 'azureml-sdk' -> enabling Docker",
  "anomalies": "Use of optional private pip wheel which could be a supply chain vector; no code obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard environment configuration script for Azure ML. It reads dependencies, optionally adds a private pip wheel, installs a core SDK, and enables Docker. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The only potential concern is the private wheel, which could be a supply chain risk if compromised, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code and the supply chain consideration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign environment setup with a minor supply chain risk due to the optional private pip wheel. The security and malware scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
