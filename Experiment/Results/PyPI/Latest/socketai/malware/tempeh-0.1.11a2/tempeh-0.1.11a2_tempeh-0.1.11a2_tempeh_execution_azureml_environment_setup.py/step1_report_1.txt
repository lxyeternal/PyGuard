  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt', optional wheel file input, environment configuration functions.",
  "sinks": "Adding private pip wheel to environment, adding pip packages, setting environment properties.",
  "flows": "Input wheel_file -> add_private_pip_wheel -> add_pip_package; requirements.txt -> from_pip_requirements -> environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an Azure ML Environment, optionally adds a private pip wheel, and adds necessary pip packages, including 'azureml-sdk'. It sets Docker to enabled and outputs a success message. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code appears standard and intended for environment setup without any suspicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward Azure ML environment configuration without signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
