  "purpose": "Configure an Azure Machine Learning environment with optional private pip wheel and required packages.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, optional wheel file input, AzureML workspace, and environment configuration methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially adds private pip wheel to environment, which could be malicious if the wheel file is tampered with; no other data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'wheel_file' flows from parameter to environment.add_private_pip_wheel, then to environment.python.conda_dependencies.add_pip_package; 'requirements.txt' is read and added to environment; environment configuration flows from creation to return.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets; use of private pip wheel is normal but could pose supply chain risk if wheel is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to configure an Azure ML environment. It reads dependencies from a requirements file and optionally incorporates a private pip wheel, which can be a vector for malicious payload if the wheel is compromised. It adds a known package 'azureml-sdk' and enables Docker. All operations are standard for environment setup, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The inclusion of private wheel handling warrants caution but is not inherently malicious. No anomalous or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard environment configuration code for Azure ML, with no explicit malicious behavior. The use of private pip wheels should be scrutinized for supply chain security, but the code itself is benign.",
