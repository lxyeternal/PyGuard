  "purpose": "Configure an Azure ML environment with optional private wheel and required packages.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for external dependencies; reads optional 'wheel_file' parameter for private pip wheel.",
  "sinks": "Adds private pip wheel and packages to the environment; potentially uploads or references external resources.",
  "flows": "Reads requirements.txt -> Adds private wheel if provided -> Adds 'azureml-sdk' package -> Enables Docker -> Returns configured environment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Use of Azure ML SDK functions appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code loads external dependencies from a 'requirements.txt' file, optionally includes a private pip wheel, and configures environment settings for Azure ML. No data leaks, malicious network activity, or backdoors are detected. The code appears to follow typical patterns for setting up Azure ML environments without suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration script for Azure Machine Learning environments, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
