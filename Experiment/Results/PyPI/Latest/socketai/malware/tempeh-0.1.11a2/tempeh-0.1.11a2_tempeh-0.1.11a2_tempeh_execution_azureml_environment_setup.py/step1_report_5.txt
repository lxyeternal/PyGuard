  "purpose": "Configure an Azure ML environment with optional private wheel and necessary dependencies",
  "sources": "Reads from 'requirements.txt', 'wheel_file' parameter, workspace object",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; no untrusted data output or external communication",
  "flows": "Reads dependencies from files and parameters, adds dependencies to environment object",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Use of AzureML SDK is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the AzureML Environment class and defines a function to create and configure an environment. It reads requirements from a file, optionally adds a private pip wheel if provided, adds 'azureml-sdk' to dependencies, and enables Docker. All operations are standard for environment setup. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. No code injection, data leakage, or network activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical environment configuration script for Azure ML without malicious intent or security risks. It handles dependencies securely and appropriately, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
