{
  "purpose": "Configure an Azure Machine Learning environment with optional private pip wheel, Azure ML SDK, and Docker support.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'requirements.txt' file for dependencies; optional input 'wheel_file'; environment variables within the AzureML SDK.",
  "sinks": "Adding private pip wheel via 'add_private_pip_wheel'; adding pip packages via 'add_pip_package'; setting 'environment.docker.enabled'.",
  "flows": "From reading 'requirements.txt' and optional 'wheel_file' to adding packages and enabling Docker, then returning the environment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no hidden or obfuscated code, and no unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up an Azure ML environment by loading requirements, optionally adding a private wheel, and installing necessary packages. It uses standard SDK functions without any code that executes external or untrusted input dynamically. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage. The use of environment variables and SDK calls appears standard and safe. The print statement is benign. Overall, the code appears straightforward, focusing on environment configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical environment setup script for Azure ML, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads inputs from known files, modifies environment configurations in a standard way, and does not include any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
