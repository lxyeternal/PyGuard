{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class (ABC) compatible with multiple Python versions using the 'six' library.",
  "sources": "Import of 'six' library, conditional import of 'ABC' or 'ABCMeta' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data leakage or external effects present.",
  "flows": "The code conditionally assigns 'ABC' to be either 'abc.ABC' or a custom class using 'ABCMeta', but no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'six' for version compatibility is common; no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a cross-version compatible definition of an abstract base class by checking 'six.PY3'. It conditionally imports and defines 'ABC' accordingly. No user input handling, no external data flows, and no malicious code behavior are present. It is a straightforward compatibility utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign compatibility pattern for Python 2 and 3. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
