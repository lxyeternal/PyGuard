  "purpose": "Compatibility boilerplate for defining an abstract base class (ABC) across Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Import of 'six' to determine Python version; conditional import or class definition based on version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external data flows, or sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "Version check via 'six.PY3' leading to import or class definition; no data flow beyond version detection.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward compatibility pattern with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code uses 'six' to detect Python version and conditionally imports 'ABC' from 'abc' in Python 3 or defines 'ABC' with 'ABCMeta' in Python 2. It is a standard pattern for cross-version compatibility. No data handling, external calls, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code is simple, clear, and widely used. No malicious, suspicious, or risky behavior is evident. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
