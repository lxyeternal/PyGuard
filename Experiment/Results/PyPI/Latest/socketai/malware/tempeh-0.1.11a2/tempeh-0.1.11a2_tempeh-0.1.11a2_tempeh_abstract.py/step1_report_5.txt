  "purpose": "Define a version-compatible abstract base class (ABC) for use in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'import six' and conditional import of ABC or ABCMeta depending on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code is purely defining a class structure.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard pattern for Python 2/3 compatibility; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'six' library to handle compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3. It conditionally imports the 'ABC' class directly in Python 3, and defines a class inheriting from 'object' with a metaclass of 'ABCMeta' in Python 2, ensuring compatibility across versions. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external calls. The structure is standard for such compatibility layers. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility utility for defining abstract base classes across Python versions. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
