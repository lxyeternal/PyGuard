  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class (ABC) compatible with multiple Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, conditional import logic for 'six' and 'abc' modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "Importing 'ABC' or 'ABCMeta' depending on Python version; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles compatibility for the 'ABC' class across Python 2 and 3 using the 'six' library. It imports the appropriate classes from 'abc' based on the Python version detected. No user input handling, no data processing, and no potential injection points are present. The code appears to be a straightforward compatibility shim with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple compatibility wrapper for abstract base classes in Python, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
