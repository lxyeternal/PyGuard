  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class (ABC) that is compatible across Python 2 and Python 3 environments.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'import six', conditional imports of ABC or ABCMeta based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output functions present.",
  "flows": "Importing 'six' to determine Python version, then defining ABC accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'six' library to facilitate compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3. It conditionally imports 'ABC' from 'abc' in Python 3, or defines a compatibility class 'ABC' with 'ABCMeta' as its metaclass for Python 2. The implementation is standard for cross-version compatibility. No data inputs, outputs, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility shim for defining an abstract base class across Python versions. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
