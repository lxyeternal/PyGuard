  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class (ABC) that is compatible across Python 2 and 3 versions.",
  "sources": "Imports 'six' module to determine Python version; imports ABC or defines ABC class with ABCMeta metaclass.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "Importing 'six' to check Python version → conditional import of ABC or defining ABC class with ABCMeta.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward compatibility handling without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'six' for version checking, then conditionally imports 'ABC' for Python 3 or defines an 'ABC' class with 'ABCMeta' for Python 2. This is standard compatibility boilerplate. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns present. The code's structure is simple and intended solely for version compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard compatibility boilerplate for defining abstract base classes across Python versions, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
