{
  "purpose": "The provided code consists solely of copyright and licensing comments, indicating ownership and licensing terms.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points of data output or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are identifiable due to lack of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only licensing comments with no executable or functional code, which is unusual for a complete source code file.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely composed of licensing comments without any functional code, input handling, or data processing. There are no code constructs, functions, or logic present that could pose security risks or malicious behavior. The absence of executable content makes malicious activity or supply chain attacks impossible within this fragment. The only unusual aspect is that it is a code file that contains only comments, which might be atypical for a functional module but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not contain any executable logic, input handling, or suspicious patterns. It is purely a licensing comment block, posing no security risks or malicious behavior concerns.",
