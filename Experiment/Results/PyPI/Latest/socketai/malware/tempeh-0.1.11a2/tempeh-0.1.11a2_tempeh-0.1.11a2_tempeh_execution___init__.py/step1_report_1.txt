  "purpose": "The provided code contains only licensing comments and no executable code.",
  "sources": "No data sources, inputs, or data reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks, data outputs, or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data or control flows exist as there is no executable code.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of licensing comments with no operational or functional code, which is unusual for a code file meant for execution.",
  "analysis": "The file only includes license and copyright comments without any actual Python code, functions, or logic. The absence of executable code or data handling makes it impossible to analyze data flow, sources, sinks, or potential malicious activity. The presence of licensing comments is typical in open-source projects and does not indicate malicious intent. The file provides no operational content to evaluate further.",
  "conclusion": "The file contains only licensing comments and no executable or operational code, indicating no malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose appears to be legal licensing documentation rather than functional code.",
