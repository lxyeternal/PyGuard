  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a standard setup script, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem reasonable given the code's nature. The small security risk accounts for the fact that importing 'tempeh' could be problematic if 'tempeh' is compromised, but this is standard practice.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Since the script imports 'tempeh' to get version info, if 'tempeh' were malicious, it could execute malicious code during import. However, this is typical in setup scripts and not inherently malicious.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0; no malicious activity observed.\n- **Assumptions?** No, the report correctly states that the code is straightforward.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with the same reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. No issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same as above, standard setup code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. No malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. No suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same analysis applies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code presence of issues?** No. All reports correctly identify the code as a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, as the only potential concern is importing 'tempeh' during setup, which could be exploited if 'tempeh' is compromised. But this is standard practice and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes needed; the reports are accurate.\n- The overall risk is minimal; the main concern is the trustworthiness of the 'tempeh' package itself, not the setup script.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (acknowledging the slight risk if 'tempeh' is compromised, but this is standard and not a direct issue with the setup script)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
