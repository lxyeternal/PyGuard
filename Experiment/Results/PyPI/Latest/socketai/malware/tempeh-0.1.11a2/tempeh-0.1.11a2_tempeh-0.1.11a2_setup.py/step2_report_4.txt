  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Verification:**\n   - The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n   - It imports `setuptools` and the local `tempeh` module to retrieve `__name__` and `__version__`.\n   - Reads `README.md` for the long description.\n   - Calls `setuptools.setup()` with metadata and dependencies.\n   - No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity are present.\n   - The code performs a typical packaging routine.\n\n2. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - The only point worth noting is that it imports the `tempeh` module to get version and name info. If `tempeh` is malicious or compromised, this could be a vector for malicious code execution during setup.\n   - However, this pattern is common in setup scripts that keep version info within the package itself.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no obfuscation.\n   - They assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Security risk scores are low (around 0.1 or 0), which seems reasonable given the standard nature of the script.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1), indicating strong agreement among the reports.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; code is straightforward.\n   - **Risk score:** The minimal risk score (around 0.1) is acceptable, considering the dependency on the `tempeh` module. If `tempeh` is compromised, it could pose a risk, but the setup script itself doesn't introduce malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - If the `tempeh` module is verified to be trustworthy, then the setup script is safe.\n   - If there is suspicion that `tempeh` could be malicious, the risk could be higher, but based on the information, there's no evidence.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores given in the reports are consistent and appropriate.\n- No changes needed unless additional context about the `tempeh` module's trustworthiness is provided.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting the dependency on potentially untrusted package info, but not malicious itself)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, trustworthy setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The dependency on the `tempeh` module for version info is common practice and not inherently risky. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
