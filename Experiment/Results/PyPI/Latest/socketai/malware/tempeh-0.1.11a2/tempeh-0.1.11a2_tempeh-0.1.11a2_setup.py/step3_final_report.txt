  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'tempeh' Python module, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; imports 'tempeh' module to access '__name__' and '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "Imports 'tempeh' to retrieve version info, then passes metadata to 'setuptools.setup()'.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward, conventional setup code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script used for packaging Python projects. It reads a README file, imports the 'tempeh' module to get version and name, and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with metadata and dependencies. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The reliance on importing 'tempeh' for version info is standard practice but assumes the package is trustworthy. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or anomalies are observed. The consistent reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) due to dependency trust assumptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily contingent on the trustworthiness of the 'tempeh' package itself. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
