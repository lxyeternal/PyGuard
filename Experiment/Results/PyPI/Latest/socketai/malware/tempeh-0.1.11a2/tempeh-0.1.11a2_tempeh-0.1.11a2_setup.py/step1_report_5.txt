  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'tempeh', used for machine learning performance testing.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; imports 'setuptools' and 'tempeh' modules; accesses 'tempeh.__name__' and 'tempeh.__version__' for package info.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setuptools.setup' to configure package installation, dependency installation via 'install_requires', and reading external files.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' -> passes long_description to setup; imports 'tempeh' -> retrieves package name and version -> used in setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; straightforward setup script. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project. It reads a markdown file for description, imports package info from 'tempeh' module, and defines dependencies. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior identified. It performs normal package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
