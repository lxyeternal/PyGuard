{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'tempeh' for distribution, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long_description; imports 'tempeh' module; reads package metadata from 'tempeh' module.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external output manipulation detected.",
  "flows": "Reads local files for description; imports package information; passes metadata to setuptools for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "Uses the 'tempeh' module to retrieve '__name__' and '__version__' for setup, which could potentially be manipulated if 'tempeh' is compromised, but this is standard practice. No suspicious code or obfuscation detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup routine for a Python package using setuptools. It reads the project README file for a description and gathers package metadata from the 'tempeh' module. The dependencies listed are typical for a machine learning testing framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious network activity. The code appears straightforward and consistent with standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It reads local files and imports package metadata safely. No anomalies or malicious behavior observed.",
