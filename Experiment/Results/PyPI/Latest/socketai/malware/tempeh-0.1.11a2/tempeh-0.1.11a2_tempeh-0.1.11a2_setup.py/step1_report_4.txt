{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package named 'tempeh' with its metadata and dependencies for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the package's long description from 'README.md' file; imports the 'tempeh' module to retrieve name and version.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; no untrusted data is directly used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reads long description from file, then uses 'setuptools.setup' to configure package installation parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; uses standard setup procedure and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, importing 'setuptools' and a local module 'tempeh'. It reads a description file and configures package metadata, including dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. The dependencies listed are common data science and machine learning libraries, with no suspicious packages. No suspicious network or data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for the 'tempeh' package, with no malicious code or security risks detected. It follows standard practices and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
