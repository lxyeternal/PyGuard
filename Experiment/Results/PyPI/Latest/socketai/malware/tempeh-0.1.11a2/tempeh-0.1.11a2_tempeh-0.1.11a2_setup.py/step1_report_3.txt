  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'tempeh' Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, importing 'tempeh' module for version and name.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data processing or network connections.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> access 'tempeh' attributes for setup -> package installation dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with standard practices. The only unusual aspect is importing the 'tempeh' module to retrieve version info, which is common but worth noting for dependency issues if 'tempeh' is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and 'tempeh', reads a markdown file for description, and calls 'setuptools.setup' with package info and dependencies. No suspicious code or behavior detected. The use of 'tempeh' for versioning is standard in setup files that maintain version info within the package itself. There are no indications of hardcoded credentials, malicious network activity, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It properly defines dependencies and package metadata. Importing 'tempeh' to access version info is common practice and not inherently malicious.",
