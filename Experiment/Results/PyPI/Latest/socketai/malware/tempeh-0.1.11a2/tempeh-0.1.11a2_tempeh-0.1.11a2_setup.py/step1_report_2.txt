  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'tempeh' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; importing the 'tempeh' package for name and version.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data or external inputs are used in a way that could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Reading file -> importing package for metadata -> setup configuration -> dependencies installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard setup.py configuration. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and a local package 'tempeh'. It reads the README.md to include a long description. The setup() call uses metadata from the 'tempeh' package and specifies dependencies required for the package. All operations are typical for a Python package setup. No suspicious code, network activity, or potential malicious behaviors are evident. The package dependencies are common machine learning libraries, with no signs of malicious inclusion. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. Overall, the code functions solely as a package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It simply prepares the package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
