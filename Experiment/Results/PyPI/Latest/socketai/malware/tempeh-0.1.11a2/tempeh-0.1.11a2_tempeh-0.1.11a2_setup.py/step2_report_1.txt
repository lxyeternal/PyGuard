  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard setup script, reading 'README.md' and importing 'tempeh' for metadata. No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malware. The confidence is high (1). The malware score is 0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior detected. The reliance on 'tempeh' for version info is common practice.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup script, no anomalies, no suspicious code or network activity. Confidence is high, malware score is 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with standard practices; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; straightforward setup, no suspicious activity, no obfuscation, malware score 0.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns; standard setup code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical setup script with no malicious indicators. Confidence is high, malware score 0.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Identical to previous reports—standard setup code, no anomalies, malware score 0.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm that the code is a standard setup script. The only potentially \"suspicious\" aspect is importing 'tempeh' to retrieve version info, but this is common practice and not inherently malicious.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, given the nature of the code; the minimal risk score of 0.1 in Report 1 is reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (appropriate for a standard setup script with minimal inherent risk)\n\n**Note:** Since all reports are consistent and confirm the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code was found.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- I agree with the overall assessment that the security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a benign, standard package setup process with no security concerns.",
