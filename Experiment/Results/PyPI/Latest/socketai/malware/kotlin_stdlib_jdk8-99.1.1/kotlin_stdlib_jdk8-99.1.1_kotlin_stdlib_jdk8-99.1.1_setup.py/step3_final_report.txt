  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining metadata and an entry point for a CLI command.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields, entry_points dict referencing 'kotlin_stdlib_jdk8' function in 'kotlin_stdlib_jdk8' module.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of 'kotlin_stdlib_jdk8' function; potential for malicious behavior depends on its implementation, which is not provided.",
  "flows": "Execution of setup() -> CLI command 'kotlin-stdlib-jdk8' -> calls 'kotlin_stdlib_jdk8' function in module 'kotlin_stdlib_jdk8'.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual package name referencing Kotlin/Java in a Python package; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security flaws. The entry point references a function whose implementation is unknown, so potential malicious behavior depends on that code. The package name and author email appear legitimate. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0, and the security risk score is minimal (0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the setup script. The overall assessment indicates the package is safe based on this code snippet, but the actual behavior depends on the referenced function's implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious activity. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code. Further review of the 'kotlin_stdlib_jdk8' function implementation is recommended to fully assess supply chain security risks.",
