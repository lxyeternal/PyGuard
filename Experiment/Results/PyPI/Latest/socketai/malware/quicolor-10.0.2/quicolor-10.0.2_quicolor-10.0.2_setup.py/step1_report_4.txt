  "purpose": "The code is used to define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'quicolor', including its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input data includes package metadata, dependencies ('requests'), and package information (name, version, author, url).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'setup()' function which installs dependencies and sets package info; however, no untrusted or malicious data handling occurs here.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are present; data is static and predefined for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors observed; code is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to specify package details, dependencies, and metadata. No dynamic code execution, input reading, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package configuration. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
