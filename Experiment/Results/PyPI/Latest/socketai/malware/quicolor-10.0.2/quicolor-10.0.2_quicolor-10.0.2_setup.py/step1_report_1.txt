  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'quicolor', including its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data within the setup() function call and import statements for 'setuptools'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or external outputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; configuration data is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All data appears static and related solely to package configuration. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. No external network activity or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior. It simply configures package metadata and dependencies for distribution. No security risks identified.",
