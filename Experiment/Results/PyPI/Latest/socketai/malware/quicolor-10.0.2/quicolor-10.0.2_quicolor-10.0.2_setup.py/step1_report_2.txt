  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'quicolor' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "User input data such as package name, version, author info, description, and URL; static dependencies declared in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no code executes untrusted input or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; setup parameters are static or controlled inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. All fields are static and typical for a Python package setup. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or unsafe behavior. No external data or untrusted input is processed, and the dependencies are explicitly listed. The script adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward and benign package setup script with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
