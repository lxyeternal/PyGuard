{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and opens an MP3 file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the internet via PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest and interacts with the filesystem to save and open the MP3 file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess commands that download a file and then open it, potentially executing malicious or unwanted content.",
  "flows": "Download URL (source) → File saved locally → File opened via subprocess (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically downloads and opens a media file during installation without user consent. The URL used is a direct download link, which could be malicious. The download and open commands are embedded in the install script, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard installation process to execute additional commands. It downloads an MP3 file from a specified URL using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest, then attempts to open the file automatically. This behavior is unusual for Python package installers, which should be idempotent and free of side effects. The URL points to a remote media file, which could be benign or malicious. The process of downloading and executing files during install could be exploited to deliver malicious payloads or perform malicious actions without user awareness. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present, but the automatic file download and execution are significant red flags.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates potentially malicious behavior by downloading and executing a file during package installation. While it may be intended for benign purposes, such behavior is unusual and suspicious for a Python package, indicating possible malicious intent or security risks.",
