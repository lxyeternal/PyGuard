  "sinks": "Console output via print function.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources; static output only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward print statement with no input, external dependencies, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The assessments and scores are accurate and do not require adjustment.",
