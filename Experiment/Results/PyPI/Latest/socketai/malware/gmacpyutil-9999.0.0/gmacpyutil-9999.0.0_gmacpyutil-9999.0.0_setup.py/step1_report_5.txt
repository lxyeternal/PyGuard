  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'gmacpyutil' for distribution, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters: name, version, description, author, author_email, packages, install_requires.",
  "sinks": "Installation process using pip or setup tools, which could potentially install dependencies or execute code if malicious hooks are present (not in this code).",
  "flows": "Setup configuration data flows into the packaging and installation process; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The version number '9999.0.0' is unusually high and non-standard, which may indicate obfuscation or a placeholder. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. It specifies package metadata and dependencies. The use of 'requests' as a dependency is common and benign. The high version number is unusual but not malicious. No code execution, input/output handling, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate Python package configuration with an atypical version number. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks in this code.",
