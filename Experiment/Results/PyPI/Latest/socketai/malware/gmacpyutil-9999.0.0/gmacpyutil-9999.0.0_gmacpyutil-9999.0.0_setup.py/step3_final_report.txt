  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python module with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields: name, version, description, author, author_email, packages, install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script does not process external inputs or perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script defines static metadata and dependencies without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual high version number '9999.0.0' as a non-standard but benign placeholder; no secrets or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setuptools setup script with no malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks. The only anomaly is the high version number, which is likely a placeholder or internal marker. The email appears legitimate. No external data inputs or dynamic behaviors are present. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious activity. The security risk score is very low (0.1), justified by the unconventional version number but not indicative of a threat. The code's structure and content are benign, and the scores across reports are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The high version number is unusual but not malicious. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
