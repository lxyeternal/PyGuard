  "purpose": "Define and configure the package 'gmacpyutil' for distribution with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters: name, version, description, author, author_email, packages, install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data handling or external data output present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there is no dynamic data flow or untrusted data source in the code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual version number '9999.0.0', which is significantly higher than standard versioning; no other suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script defining package metadata and dependencies. The use of 'requests' as a dependency is common and not suspicious. The high version number is unconventional but not malicious. No code execution, input/output handling, or obfuscated code present. The script performs a typical package configuration task without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal package setup configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The high version number is unusual but not harmful.",
