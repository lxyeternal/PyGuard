  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to a specified remote endpoint during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, reading '/etc/resolv.conf', reading '/etc/passwd', executing 'ls /' command, getting current working directory.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to an external URL with collected data.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables and file reads (sources) are compiled into a payload and sent via HTTP POST to a remote server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code gathers sensitive system information such as passwd contents, DNS servers, and root directory listing, and transmits it without user consent or notification. It executes system commands, reads potentially sensitive files, and performs network communication during package installation, which is suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code collects detailed system info including hostname, username, DNS servers, directory listing, and passwd contents. It uses environment variables, file reads, subprocess calls, and network requests. The data collection is extensive and includes sensitive information. The data is transmitted to an external endpoint without explicit user awareness, which could be malicious. The code is executed during package installation, potentially leading to privacy violations or malicious tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs extensive collection of sensitive system data and transmits it to an external server without user consent. This behavior indicates malicious intent, primarily privacy invasion and potential data exfiltration. The code should be flagged as malicious due to its unauthorized data collection and transmission.",
