{
  "purpose": "Collects system information such as hostname, user, DNS servers, directory listing, passwd contents, OS details, and sends this data to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (USER, USERNAME), reading /etc/resolv.conf, executing 'ls /', reading /etc/passwd, and calling os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data via HTTP POST request to an external URL",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, files, subprocess output) are aggregated into 'payload' and then transmitted over the network to an external server",
  "anomalies": "Collects sensitive system files (/etc/passwd), performs directory listing, and transmits data to an external domain without user consent; no explicit obfuscation or unusual language features",
  "analysis": "The code gathers various system details including hostname, user info, DNS servers, directory contents, and passwd contents, then posts this data to an external URL. The collection includes sensitive data (passwd, directory listing), and the data is sent over the network without any user interaction or explicit permission, indicating potentially malicious or privacy-invasive intent. No input validation or user control mechanisms are present. The code runs automatically during package installation, which can be exploited for clandestine data collection. There are no obfuscation tactics or malicious backdoors embedded, but the behavior is privacy-invasive and could be used maliciously if intended for tracking or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs system reconnaissance and exfiltrates sensitive information to an external server without user consent, constituting malicious behavior and privacy violation. It has a high security risk score due to the collection and transmission of sensitive data during package installation.",
