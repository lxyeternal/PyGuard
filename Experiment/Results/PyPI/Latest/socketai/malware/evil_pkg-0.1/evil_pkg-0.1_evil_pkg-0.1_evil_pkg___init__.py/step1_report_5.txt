  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that performs some form of data processing or utility function, but the specific purpose is unclear without additional context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, input functions, and possibly file operations (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writes, or executing system commands, if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources or environment variables to sinks such as network calls or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures detected. No obfuscated code or misleading variables observed. No unusual dynamic code execution or suspicious network connections apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure and content do not indicate malicious intent. It uses standard library functions and typical data handling patterns. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The absence of network calls or system manipulations suggests low malicious potential. Without additional context or hidden code, the risk appears minimal.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, with no indicators of malware or supply chain attacks.",
