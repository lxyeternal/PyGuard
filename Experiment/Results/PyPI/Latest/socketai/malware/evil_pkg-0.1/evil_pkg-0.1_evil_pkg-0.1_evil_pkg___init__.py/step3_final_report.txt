{
  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on source-to-sink data flows and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, or external files; network calls or URL fetches; dynamic code execution functions like eval or exec.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections to suspicious domains, file modifications, or system commands executed with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input sources may flow into eval/exec functions, network calls, or file operations, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation techniques, dynamic code execution, suspicious URLs or credentials, hardcoded secrets, or unusual control flow structures.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no malicious behavior, with no suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. Data flows are benign, and no suspicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose appears to be a standard utility or benign module. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9). No obfuscation or malware indicators are present. The security risk is low (0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores reflect a low threat level, and no further action is necessary.",
