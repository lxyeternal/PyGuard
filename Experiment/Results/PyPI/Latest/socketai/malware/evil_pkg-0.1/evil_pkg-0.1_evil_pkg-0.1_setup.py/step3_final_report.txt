  "purpose": "The code collects all environment variables and immediately exfiltrates them via an HTTP POST request to localhost, then defines a package with a misleading name and description.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables from os.environ",
  "sinks": "requests.post to 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/steal' with environment data",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read from os.environ and sent directly to the local server via requests.post",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration at runtime, use of localhost as target, misleading package name 'evil-pkg' with benign description",
  "analysis": "The code unconditionally captures all environment variables and sends them to a local server, indicating malicious data theft. The package setup is straightforward but uses a misleading name, suggesting malicious intent. The behavior is clear and unambiguous, with no obfuscation or complex logic. The exfiltration target being localhost could suggest testing, but in a supply chain context, it is suspicious. The code's simplicity and the nature of the activity justify high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious environment data exfiltration, with a misleading package name, indicating high malicious intent and security risk. The behavior is straightforward and not obfuscated. The scores of malware 0.9 and security risk 0.9 are justified.",
