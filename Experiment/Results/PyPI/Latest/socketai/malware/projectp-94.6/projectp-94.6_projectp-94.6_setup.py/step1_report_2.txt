{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including a custom install command that executes a function from an external module during installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules ('setuptools', 'main' within the custom install class) and executes 'main()' during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function from 'main' module during install, which could contain arbitrary or malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method calls 'main()' from 'main' module after completing standard installation steps.",
  "anomalies": "The invocation of 'main()' during installation without any apparent validation or restrictions. No other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a package with standard dependencies ('requests', 'psutil') and defines a custom install class. The custom class 'CrazyInstallStrat' executes 'main()' from an external module during installation. This behavior could be used maliciously if 'main' contains harmful code. However, the setup code itself is standard, with no evidence of obfuscation, hidden payloads, or malicious actions within the setup script. The main concern is the execution of external code ('main()') during installation, which is a potential supply chain attack vector if the 'main' module is malicious or compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script itself appears standard but includes a potentially dangerous practice: executing 'main()' during installation. This could be exploited for malicious purposes if 'main' contains harmful code. No other suspicious or malicious code features are present in the provided snippet.",
