  "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing main() during installation is a significant supply chain security concern. While the actual maliciousness depends on main.py's content, the pattern itself warrants caution. The current scores are appropriate but could be adjusted upward to better reflect the potential risk, especially the malware score. Further review of main.py is necessary to determine if malicious actions are present."
