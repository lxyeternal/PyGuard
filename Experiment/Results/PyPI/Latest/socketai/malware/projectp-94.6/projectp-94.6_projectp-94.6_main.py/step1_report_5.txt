  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() for sending data to remote servers",
  "flows": "Input data from system info functions is encoded and sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs pointing to suspicious domains; sending encoded MAC addresses; no validation or filtering of data; no response handling beyond try-except",
  "analysis": "The script collects system details such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. MAC addresses are fetched differently based on OS and then encoded with base64. It constructs URLs with these details as parameters, appending a random number for each request, and sends GET requests to external domains that are suspicious or unknown. The code does not process responses and silently ignores exceptions. The URLs suggest potential data exfiltration or command and control communications. No malicious payload execution or code injection is present. No obfuscation or hidden malicious code is detected, but the purpose of data collection and transmission to untrusted domains is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily gathers system information and transmits it to external, potentially malicious domains without user consent or validation. Although it does not execute malicious payloads, it appears designed for data exfiltration or surveillance. The usage of suspicious URLs and encoding indicates malicious intent or at least malicious behavior, warranting caution.",
