  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs via GET requests with encoded parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading system data such as platform information, user details, current directory, and MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests to external URLs with query parameters containing encoded system data.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) is encoded and included as URL parameters, then sent via HTTP GET to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of base64 encoding for MAC addresses, collection of MAC addresses across multiple OS platforms, and sending data to suspicious domains (they appear non-legitimate and potentially malicious). The URLs are obscure, and the code silently ignores errors during network requests, which may be to hide failures.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers host-specific data including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 before including them as URL parameters. The code then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to three external domains. The URLs do not appear to belong to reputable services and could be used for tracking or exfiltration. The silent exception handling suggests an attempt to avoid raising alarms if network requests fail. There are no signs of data manipulation, backdoors, or malicious payloads; however, the collection and transmission of system info to suspicious domains is a privacy and security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects system information and transmits it to external, suspicious domains, which could be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or data exfiltration. While no malicious payload is executed, the behavior indicates potentially malicious intent or privacy invasion, especially given the obscure URLs and silent failure handling.",
