  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send encoded MAC addresses along with other system details to multiple URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (reading system network interfaces), random.randint() for rd_num",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url) sending data via HTTP GET request to external URLs",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, MAC addresses, random number) are encoded and included as URL parameters in HTTP requests sent to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names, encoding of MAC addresses, and sending data without any validation or response handling. The URLs seem obfuscated or suspicious, potentially for exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and constructs URLs with these parameters along with a random number. It then makes HTTP GET requests to external domains with these parameters. The URLs are suspicious and possibly malicious, aiming to exfiltrate system data. The code does not process responses meaningfully, only attempts to send data, indicating potential data leakage. There is no validation or sanitization, but no malicious commands or system modifications are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be designed for covert data collection and exfiltration of system info. The use of suspicious URLs and the encoding of MAC addresses suggest malicious intent or at least malicious behavior, possibly as part of a covert channel. It does not contain overt backdoors or destructive code but could be used for malicious purposes.",
