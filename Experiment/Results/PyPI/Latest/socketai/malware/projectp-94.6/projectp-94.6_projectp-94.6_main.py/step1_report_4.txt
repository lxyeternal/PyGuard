  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple remote URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network interfaces and MAC addresses, random.randint() generating a random number, base64 encoding of MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending HTTP GET requests to external URLs with encoded system data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info and MAC addresses) are encoded and included as URL parameters, which are then sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or suspicious URLs with unusual domain names, inclusion of base64-encoded MAC addresses, and sending potentially sensitive system data to external servers without any validation or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system-specific information, including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, possibly to obscure the data. The script then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains, appending the collected data as URL parameters, and sends HTTP GET requests. The URLs are non-standard and could be malicious command-and-control servers or data exfiltration points. The data collection and transmission are performed silently, with exception handling that suppresses errors, indicating a possible attempt to operate covertly. There are no indications of malicious code execution, backdoors, or destructive activities; however, the data exfiltration behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects sensitive system data and transmits it to external suspicious domains without user consent, which could indicate malicious intent or data exfiltration behavior. There are no clear signs of malware like backdoors or destructive actions, but the activity is suspicious and warrants caution.",
