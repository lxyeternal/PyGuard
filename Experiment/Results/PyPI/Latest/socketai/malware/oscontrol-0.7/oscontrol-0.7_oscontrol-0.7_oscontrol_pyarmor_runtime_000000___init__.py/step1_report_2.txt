{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or runtime protection.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.pyarmor_runtime'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is observable here.",
  "anomalies": "Comment line mentioning Pyarmor trial version; no suspicious or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a comment indicating the Pyarmor version and a single import statement for a runtime module. Pyarmor is used for obfuscating Python code to protect it from reverse engineering. The import itself does not perform any malicious actions. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or other suspicious operations present. The code is minimal and appears to serve as a runtime dependency for obfuscation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal import statement for the Pyarmor runtime, with an accompanying comment about the trial version. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment alone.",
