{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import a runtime module for Pyarmor, which is a tool used for obfuscating and protecting Python code.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks present; no untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; import statement does not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating a Pyarmor trial version and a date, which may suggest obfuscation or licensing restrictions, but no malicious code or behavior is evident",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and primarily imports a module associated with Pyarmor, a legitimate obfuscation tool. No suspicious functions, data handling, or malicious behaviors are present. The comment indicates version and licensing info but does not imply malicious intent. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or malicious logic itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement for a Pyarmor runtime module, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a protected code environment, not an attack vector.",
