{
  "purpose": "The code imports a runtime module related to Pyarmor obfuscation and licensing, with a comment indicating a trial version and expiration date.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime and the comment with version and expiration info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code is a simple import statement.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or output; the code merely imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating a trial license and expiration date; no actual obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a straightforward import of a runtime module used for code protection. The comment suggests the use of Pyarmor with a trial license, which is common in protected codebases. No suspicious functions, network activity, or data leaks are present. The malware score is 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The obfuscated score is low (around 0.1) because the code itself is simple and not obfuscated, though comments imply obfuscation. The security risk score is very low (0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the code and licensing comments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, part of a protected environment using Pyarmor, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
