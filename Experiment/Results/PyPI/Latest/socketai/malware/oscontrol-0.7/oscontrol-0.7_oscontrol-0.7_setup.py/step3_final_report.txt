{
  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata for a Python project using setuptools, serving to configure package installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Static parameters within the setup() function, including package name, version, packages, description, author, python_requires, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; all parameters are static and predefined, with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the strict Python version requirement '==3.12.*', which could impact compatibility but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration file, importing setuptools and calling setup() with static, well-defined arguments. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical packaging practices. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, with high confidence. The strict Python version requirement is noted but does not constitute a security concern. Overall, the code poses no security threats or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration script with no malicious or security issues detected. The scores assigned across reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
