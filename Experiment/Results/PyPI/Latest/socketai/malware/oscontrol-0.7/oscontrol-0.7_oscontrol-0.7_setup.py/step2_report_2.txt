  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The original code is a straightforward, standard `setup.py` script using setuptools.\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, lacks dynamic or user input, and contains no suspicious constructs.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The only minor point is the strict Python version requirement (`==3.12.*`), which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Risk: 0\n   - Confidence: 1.0\n   - **Assessment:** Correct. No issues found.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Risk: 0\n   - Confidence: 1\n   - **Assessment:** Correct. The script is benign.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Risk: 0\n   - Confidence: 1\n   - **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Risk: 0\n   - Confidence: 1\n   - **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Risk: 0\n   - Confidence: 1\n   - **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are consistent with the code being a benign, standard setup script.\n- No changes needed in the scores or reasoning.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The risk score remains at 0, as there are no security concerns.\n- Obfuscation remains at 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I agree with all the assessments.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0, 0, and 0 respectively.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical, safe `setup.py` configuration with no malicious or security issues detected.",
