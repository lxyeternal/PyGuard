{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script configures the packaging and distribution of the 'oscontrol' Python library.",
  "sources": "Input data is from package metadata such as name, version, author, and Python version requirement.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include package installation processes and distribution on PyPI, but no explicit data sinks are present in this script.",
  "flows": "The flow is from package metadata definitions to the packaging and distribution process initiated by setuptools.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard setuptools methods with straightforward package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with typical parameters defining package name, version, packages, author, Python version requirement, and classifiers. No dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code is present. The package configuration appears standard and benign, focusing solely on package setup without any obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is a standard package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for packaging the 'oscontrol' library.",
