  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'oscontrol' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources or input reading; configuration data is static within the setup script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script solely configures package metadata without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward package setup with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py imports standard setuptools modules to define package configuration, including name, version, packages, data inclusion, description, author, Python version requirement, and classifiers. The code does not include any dynamic execution, user input processing, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. All elements are typical for a Python package setup file, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified. It simply configures package metadata for distribution.",
