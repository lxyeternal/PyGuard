  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate component of a code protection tool (Pyarmor), embedding encrypted data for license enforcement. While the obfuscation and encrypted payloads warrant caution, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The scores assigned are consistent with the pattern—high obfuscation, low malware likelihood, moderate risk—necessitating further analysis for full confirmation."
