{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a custom installation process that generates and executes a reverse shell script upon installation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from a hardcoded list of integers which are decoded into Python code; this code is written to a temporary file and then executed via a base64-decoded command pipeline.",
  "sinks": "The decoded code is executed with 'os.system' after being written to a file, and the reverse shell command is executed via base64 decoding piped into bash.",
  "flows": "The integer list is decoded into Python code, written to '/tmp/xxx.py', then a reverse shell command is base64-encoded and decoded in a shell pipeline, which is executed via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a large array of obfuscated integers, which are decoded into code, likely to conceal malicious intent. It writes a Python script to a temporary location and executes a reverse shell command, which is suspicious and malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script uses obfuscation through a list of integers that, when decoded, produce malicious Python code. It writes this code to a temporary file and then runs a reverse shell command encoded in base64, decoded, and executed via a shell pipeline. This behavior indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity, specifically establishing reverse shells. The package setup labels itself with a malicious description and author, further suggesting intent to compromise systems. The code's structure and obfuscation strongly indicate malicious behavior with the purpose of remote access or control.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including obfuscation, dynamic code generation, and execution of a reverse shell. It aims to compromise systems during installation, making it highly dangerous and malicious.",
