{
  "purpose": "A simple function that prints 'hello world' to the console.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs to the console; no untrusted data handling or network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "anomalies": "Syntax error in the if statement: uses '=' instead of '==', which prevents execution and indicates a possible mistake or incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function 'hello' that outputs a string. The conditional 'if __name__ = \"__main__\":' is incorrect syntax; it should use '=='. This syntax error would prevent the code from running as intended. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The code is extremely simple and does not perform any network, file, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, trivial script with a syntax error. No malicious intent or security risks are present. The error appears accidental rather than malicious.",
