  "purpose": "Simple script to print 'hello world' when executed.",
  "sources": "Input is not explicitly read; the code reads no external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "Output to console via print function; no untrusted data is used or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; the code just calls a function that prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "Syntax error in the if statement: '=' should be '==', indicating a typo but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a basic function 'hello' that prints a static message. The conditional statement intended to execute the function when run directly has a typo ('=' instead of '=='), which would cause a runtime error. No external data is read, and no untrusted inputs or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is very simple, with no obfuscated or malicious code elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward 'hello world' script with a syntax error that prevents proper execution. There are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious data flows, and no security risks evident. The primary issue is the typo in the main guard condition, not malicious intent.",
