  "purpose": "Simple 'hello world' script with a syntax error in the main guard.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; the only source is the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code executes a print statement if corrected.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the syntax error in the 'if' statement ('=' instead of '==').",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that prints 'hello world' and attempts to run it under a main guard. The main guard contains a syntax error ('=' instead of '=='), which prevents execution. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is present. The syntax error is a simple typo, not an indication of malicious intent. The code is trivial and benign. The reports correctly identify the syntax mistake and assign malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The overall security risk is negligible, and the error is fixable without security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign 'hello world' script with a syntax typo. No malicious or security issues are present. The scores are appropriate, and the only necessary correction is fixing the syntax error for proper execution.",
