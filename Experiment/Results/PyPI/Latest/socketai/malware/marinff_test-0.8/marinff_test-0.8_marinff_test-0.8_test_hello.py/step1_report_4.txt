  "purpose": "A simple function to print 'hello world' when executed as the main module.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are used in the code.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to the console; no data leaks or external communications occur.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; code executes a straightforward print call.",
  "anomalies": "Syntax error in the conditional statement: '=' used instead of '=='. No malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'hello' that prints a greeting. The main guard condition intended to execute 'hello()' if the script is run directly. However, the use of a single '=' in 'if __name__ = \"__main__\":' is a syntax error, which would prevent execution. The code contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The only issue is the syntax mistake.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign but contains a syntax error that would prevent it from running correctly. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
