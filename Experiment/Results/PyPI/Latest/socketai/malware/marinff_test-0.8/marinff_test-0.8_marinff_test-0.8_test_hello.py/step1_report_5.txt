  "purpose": "Simple function to print 'hello world' when executed as a script",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output (print statement), no untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code merely calls a function and prints",
  "anomalies": "Syntax error in the main guard: '=' should be '=='",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function 'hello' that prints a greeting. The conditional statement intended to check if the script is run directly contains a syntax error ('=' instead of '=='), which would prevent proper execution. No external data inputs, no use of environment variables, no database operations, and no suspicious code. The code is straightforward and does not perform any malicious actions. The syntax error indicates a mistake rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign example with a syntax error. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The primary issue is the syntax mistake in the main guard, which needs correction for proper execution.",
