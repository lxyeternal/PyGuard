      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python library. The only concern is the 'python_requires' constraint targeting an unreleased Python version, which may cause installation issues but does not constitute a security threat or malicious activity. The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "This code is a typical Pyarmor obfuscation wrapper used for protecting Python scripts. While the heavy obfuscation and embedded binary are suspicious, they are consistent with legitimate code protection. The overall risk is low, but further binary analysis is recommended to confirm the safety of the embedded payload."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement associated with Pyarmor obfuscation or licensing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores in the reports are generally appropriate, though the obfuscation score should be lowered to reflect the simplicity of the code."
