  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Pyarmor obfuscation wrapper used for protecting Python scripts. While the heavy obfuscation and embedded binary are suspicious, they are consistent with legitimate code protection. The overall risk is low, but further binary analysis is recommended to confirm the safety of the embedded payload."
