{
  "purpose": "This code loads and executes a Pyarmor runtime, likely part of an obfuscated or protected script, used for code protection or licensing enforcement.",
  "sources": "The embedded binary blob passed to __pyarmor__ and the import of the __pyarmor__ runtime module.",
  "sinks": "The __pyarmor__ function processes or executes the embedded binary data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the embedded binary blob into __pyarmor__, which decrypts or runs it.",
  "anomalies": "Large encrypted/obfuscated binary blob, typical in code protection schemes; no explicit malicious commands or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Pyarmor runtime module and passes a large encrypted data blob to __pyarmor__, which is characteristic of protected or obfuscated scripts. The pattern is consistent with legitimate use of Pyarmor for code obfuscation and licensing. No signs of malicious activity such as network connections, file modifications, or backdoors are evident. The obfuscation level is high, but this is typical for such protection tools. The primary concern is the binary payload, which could conceal malicious code, but without further binary analysis, it appears to be part of a standard protection mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Pyarmor obfuscation wrapper used for protecting Python scripts. While the heavy obfuscation and embedded binary are suspicious, they are consistent with legitimate code protection. The overall risk is low, but further binary analysis is recommended to confirm the safety of the embedded payload.",
