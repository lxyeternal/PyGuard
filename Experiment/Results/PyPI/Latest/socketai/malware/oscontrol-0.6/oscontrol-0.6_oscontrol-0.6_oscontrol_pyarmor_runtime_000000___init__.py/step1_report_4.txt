{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or runtime protection purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or external output actions",
  "flows": "Not applicable; simple import without data flow",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating use of Pyarmor trial version; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named __pyarmor__ from a relative package, which is consistent with code obfuscation or runtime protection tools. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network activity. The comment suggests the use of Pyarmor's trial version, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement associated with code obfuscation/protection tools, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
