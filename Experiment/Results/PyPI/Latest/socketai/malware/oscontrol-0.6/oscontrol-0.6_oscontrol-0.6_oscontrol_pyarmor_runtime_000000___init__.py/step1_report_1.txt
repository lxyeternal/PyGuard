  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for obfuscation or protection purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication evident",
  "flows": "Import statement loads a module, but no data flow or further processing visible",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating trial version and expiration date, which could suggest software restrictions or obfuscation tactics; no other unusual code or secrets observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a runtime module associated with Pyarmor, a tool used for code obfuscation and licensing. The comment references a trial version and expiration date, which might be related to licensing restrictions. No other malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no data inputs, external communication, or obfuscated constructs beyond standard obfuscation tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be part of a protected or obfuscated Python package using Pyarmor. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The comment indicates trial version info, possibly for licensing enforcement.",
