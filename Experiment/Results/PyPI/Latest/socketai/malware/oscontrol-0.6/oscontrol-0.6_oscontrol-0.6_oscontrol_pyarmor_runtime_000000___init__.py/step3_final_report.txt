{
  "purpose": "Import the Pyarmor runtime module, likely for obfuscation or licensing enforcement.",
  "sources": "Import from the local module '.pyarmor_runtime'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication; import statement alone.",
  "flows": "Import statement without data flow or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating a trial version and expiration date; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import of a Pyarmor runtime module, with a comment about a trial license. No suspicious behavior, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The import suggests use of obfuscation or licensing mechanisms typical for protected scripts. The minimal nature of the code and absence of network or data leaks indicate low security risk. The high obfuscation score in one report appears inflated given the simplicity of the code; a lower score (~0.1) is more appropriate. Malware activity is not suggested by the code. The confidence in these conclusions is high due to the straightforward analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement associated with Pyarmor obfuscation or licensing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores in the reports are generally appropriate, though the obfuscation score should be lowered to reflect the simplicity of the code.",
