{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script is used to package and distribute a Python library named 'oscontrol'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata such as package name, version, description, author, and Python version requirements.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or external sinks; the script does not handle user input or network data.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static metadata definitions to the setup() function call which creates the package.",
  "anomalies": "The 'python_requires' specifies an exact Python version '==3.13.*', which is unusual since Python 3.13 is not yet released; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and uses find_packages() to locate packages, then calls setup() with static metadata. No dynamic code execution, external data sources, or suspicious patterns are present. The version requirement is overly restrictive but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security issues. The only notable aspect is the specific Python version requirement, which may cause compatibility issues but is not malicious.",
