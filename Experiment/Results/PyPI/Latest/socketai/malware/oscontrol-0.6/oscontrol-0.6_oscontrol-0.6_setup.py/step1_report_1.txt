  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'oscontrol' Python package, including metadata and package inclusion.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, specifically 'setup' and 'find_packages'. No input sources or external data reads observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data or external systems. No potentially dangerous operations or external communications.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code appears to be a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata including name, version, packages, description, author, python_requires, and classifiers. All parameters are static, standard, and do not involve external inputs or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors such as network activity, file modification, or credential handling.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script appears to be a benign, standard package configuration without malicious intent or security risks.",
