  "purpose": "To define the package metadata and configuration for the Python library 'oscontrol' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading input or external data; mainly static setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "N/A — static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py is a standard configuration script for a Python package, specifying package info, dependencies, and metadata. It includes a specific Python version requirement ('==3.13.*'), which is unusual but not malicious. No code execution, input reading, or external data handling is present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate package configuration code.",
