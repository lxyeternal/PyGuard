  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'AbstractSender' from a relative module 'sender' and then exposes it via '__all__'. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, or external communications. The code is straightforward, serving as an interface or module export configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears to be standard module export syntax without any malicious intent or security risks.",
