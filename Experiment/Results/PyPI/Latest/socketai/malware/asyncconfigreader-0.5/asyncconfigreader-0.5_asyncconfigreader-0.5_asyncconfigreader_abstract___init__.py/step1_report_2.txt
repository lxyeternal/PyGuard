  "purpose": "Export the AbstractSender class from the sender module for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports the AbstractSender class from a local module named sender.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow mechanisms are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no unusual or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class and defines an __all__ list for module exports. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, network activity, or execute any dynamic code. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. Given its simplicity, it appears to be a standard module export statement.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic module definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply exposes the AbstractSender class for external use.",
