  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a simple import and export declaration.\n   - There are no signs of data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and does not contain any security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the code's simplicity.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a straightforward module export pattern.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, with all scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) at 0.\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely an import/export declaration with no malicious or risky behavior, a high risk score is unwarranted.\n   - The current risk scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly state the benign nature.\n   - No assumptions are unjustified.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard module export pattern with no security concerns.**",
