  "conclusion": "The script is not inherently malicious but poses a high security risk if misused. Its ability to silently download and execute arbitrary files from untrusted sources, combined with unsafe subprocess usage and lack of validation, makes it highly exploitable for malicious purposes. The current assessment of malware potential should be increased to reflect this risk."
