{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or aggregator, importing specific classes and enums from internal modules and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads from internal modules: .ms, .enums, and .utils, importing classes and enums.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is from internal module imports to the __all__ declaration, with no external data or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is a straightforward import/export module with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py file that imports classes and enums from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. It contains no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The code's purpose is purely organizational, facilitating external access to internal components. Given this, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a package initializer with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
