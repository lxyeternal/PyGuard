{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module import and export statement, likely part of a larger package that organizes various classes and enums for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ms, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply imports and re-exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors present",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes and enums from local modules and defines __all__ for exports. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module index file, used to organize and expose functionality. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward module import/export structure with no malicious behavior detected. It is a standard pattern for Python packages to manage namespace and accessibility.",
