  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple `__init__.py` or module aggregator, importing classes/enums from internal modules and exposing them via `__all__`.\n- No report identifies any suspicious, malicious, or anomalous code constructs.\n- The code does not process external data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are very low or zero, consistent with the minimal nature of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is straightforward and serves as an interface, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty in these assessments.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, which is reasonable given the minimal risk.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The report with a `securityRisk` of 0.1 (Report 4) might be overestimating the risk slightly. Since the code is purely import/export, the risk is negligible unless the internal modules themselves are malicious, which is not indicated here.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering minimal package organization risk, but 0 is more appropriate)\n\nThis review confirms that the code is a benign package initializer with no security concerns.",
