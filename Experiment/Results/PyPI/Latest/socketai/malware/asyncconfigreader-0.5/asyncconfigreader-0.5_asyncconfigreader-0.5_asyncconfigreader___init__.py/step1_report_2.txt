{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an import and export module, consolidating specific classes and enums for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ms, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data processing points present; no untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; mainly module exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enums from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, enabling their use in other parts of the project. It does not process input, handle external data, or execute dynamic code. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident from these import and export statements. The code is minimal and straightforward, primarily serving as an interface or aggregator for internal components.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard module aggregator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply re-exports classes and enums for external use, and there are no anomalies or suspicious patterns present.",
