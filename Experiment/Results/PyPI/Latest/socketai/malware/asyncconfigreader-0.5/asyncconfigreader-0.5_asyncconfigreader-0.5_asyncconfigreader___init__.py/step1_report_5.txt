{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an import and export module, aggregating various classes and enums for use in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.ms, .enums, .utils) indicating data or functionality dependencies within the package.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code only defines what to export and does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows; the code only imports and exposes symbols, with no runtime data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden functionality. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and enums from relative modules and defines an __all__ list for export. It functions as a module aggregator, not executing any complex logic or external calls. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. It is minimal and typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import/export pattern with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply organizes and exposes components of the package.",
