{
  "purpose": "Module initialization and export of classes and enums for a larger package",
  "sources": "Imports from local package modules: .ms, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted input handling observed",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; just imports and exports of components",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations observed; straightforward import/export structure",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enums from internal modules and defines the __all__ list for package exports. There are no external inputs, network communications, or data manipulations that could be exploited. The code appears to serve as a module interface setup. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection, are evident. The structure is standard for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment functions solely to organize and export components within a package. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
