  "purpose": "Defines an abstract template class for data transmission with SSL configuration control.",
  "sources": "Method '_create_unverified_https' that overrides SSL context to disable verification.",
  "sinks": "The static method that sets 'ssl._create_default_https_context' to an unverified context.",
  "flows": "Invocation of '_create_unverified_https' affects all subsequent HTTPS connections by disabling SSL verification.",
  "anomalies": "The method disables SSL verification globally, which can be exploited if misused; no malicious code or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward abstract class designed for subclass implementation. The only security concern is the '_create_unverified_https' method, which disables SSL verification by overriding the default SSL context. This introduces a security risk of man-in-the-middle attacks if used improperly but does not constitute malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is detected. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clear structure. The security risk score is approximately 0.3, reflecting the potential security concern associated with the SSL bypass method. The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the associated risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious abstract class with a security concern due to the SSL verification bypass method. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main risk stems from potential misuse of the SSL bypass, which could facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks if invoked improperly. The overall security risk is low to moderate, with a malware score of 0 and an obfuscated score of 0.",
