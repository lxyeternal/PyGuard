  "purpose": "Display a configurable fake error message window using Windows API.",
  "sources": "Message content and title from MessageConfig, read during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "The MessageBoxW API call displays the message; no untrusted data flow beyond configuration.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows directly into MessageBoxW to display the message window.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling may hide runtime errors; reliance on external MessageConfig without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly creates a Windows message box with content from MessageConfig. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The broad try-except block suppresses errors silently, which is a poor practice but not malicious. The purpose appears to be to show a fake error message, potentially for social engineering. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration are detected. The use of Windows API is standard for such dialogs. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by potential misuse in social engineering but not by technical maliciousness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a simple purpose of displaying a configurable message box. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is found. The low security risk score is appropriate, with the main concern being potential deception if message content is manipulated. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe, with minimal security implications.",
