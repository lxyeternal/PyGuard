  "flows": "self.__config.MessageDescription and self.__config.MessageTitle -> windll.user32.MessageBoxW",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except block that suppresses all exceptions; no hardcoded secrets; reliance on external MessageConfig object without validation",
  "analysis": "The code creates a class Message that shows a Windows message box with configurable text and title from MessageConfig. No data is received from external untrusted sources; the message contents are likely configurable but not necessarily malicious. The code uses Windows API directly, which is typical for UI notifications. The try-except block suppresses errors but does not handle or log them, which might hide issues but does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior observed. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to display a fake error message window. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on this analysis. It relies on external configuration for message content. No malware or malicious intent evident.",
