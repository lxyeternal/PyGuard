{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define the public API of a Python package by importing several classes from local modules and exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are evident; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; the code simply imports modules and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; the code is minimal and standard for package interface definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports five classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__, which is typical for Python package API definition. There are no dynamic executions, no hardcoded secrets, and no network or file operations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward, focusing on module export declarations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package __init__.py pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports classes for external use. The code appears benign.",
