{
  "purpose": "The code defines module exports for importing classes related to autostart, messaging, loading, protection, and grabbing functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only imports and exports class references.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; primarily module references.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements and an export list; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward module initializer, importing classes from local modules and exposing them via __all__. No input handling, data processing, or network operations present. The absence of code execution, data manipulation, or external communication indicates minimal security concern. Given only this fragment, no malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions as an import/export aggregator for specific classes. No malicious or suspicious activities are detected.",
