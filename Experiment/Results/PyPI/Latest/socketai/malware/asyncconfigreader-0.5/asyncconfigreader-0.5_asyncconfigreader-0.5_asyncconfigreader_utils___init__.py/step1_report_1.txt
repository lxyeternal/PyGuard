{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes from relative submodules for use elsewhere, likely as part of a larger Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current package directory, importing classes from autostart, message, loader, protector, and grabber modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply imports classes and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present; the code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from sibling modules and sets the __all__ list for public API exposure. It lacks any input handling, data processing, or network communication. The simplicity indicates it is a standard module import pattern, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python module for organizing imports and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a component aggregator without performing any actions that could harm or compromise security.",
