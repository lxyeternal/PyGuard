{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module's __init__.py file that imports specific classes from local modules to make them accessible when the package is imported.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no external data handling or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as there are only import statements and an __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an explicit __all__ declaration, which is standard in Python package __init__.py files for defining public API. There are no functions, data handling, or dynamic code execution that could suggest malicious activity. The imported modules' contents are not provided, so potential risks depend on their implementation, but this fragment alone is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward __init__.py file setting up module exports without any malicious behavior or security risks identified. It merely organizes package components for external access.",
