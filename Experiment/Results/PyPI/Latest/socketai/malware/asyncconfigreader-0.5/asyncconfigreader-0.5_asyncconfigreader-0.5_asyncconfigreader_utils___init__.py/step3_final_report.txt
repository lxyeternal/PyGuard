{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing specific classes from sibling modules and exposing them via __all__ for public API access.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports classes from local modules autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only imports and exposes classes without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static module setup, importing classes from sibling modules and defining __all__. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores across reports are consistent, assigning zero to malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's benign nature relies on the assumption that imported modules are safe, but based solely on this fragment, it is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
