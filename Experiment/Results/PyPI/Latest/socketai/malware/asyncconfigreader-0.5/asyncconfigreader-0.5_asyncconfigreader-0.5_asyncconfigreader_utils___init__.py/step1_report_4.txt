{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports several classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use, likely part of a larger Python package.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports and __all__ declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed. The module structure is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, which are typical in Python packages to control namespace exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or suspicious operations. The imports are from local modules, suggesting modular design, but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, external network activity, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package interface with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply re-exports classes from internal modules for external use.",
