  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'asyncconfigreader' with a dependency on 'pynput'.",
  "sources": "The setup() function reads package configuration, including dependencies and package discovery.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no code executing untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Uses standard setuptools API without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward package setup file that defines package name, version, required dependencies, and package discovery. The only dependency is 'pynput', which is a legitimate library for input device control. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. No input/output operations, network activity, or code execution based on untrusted data. The code is minimal and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
