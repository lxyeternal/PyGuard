  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'asyncconfigreader' Python package, specifying dependencies and packages to include.",
  "sources": "The 'install_requires' list specifying 'pynput==1.7.7'. The call to 'find_packages()' which identifies package directories.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in this code; no data flows or external data outputs are indicated.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only defines package metadata and dependencies, with no data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is a standard setup script with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines package name, version, dependencies, and package discovery. The only dependency is 'pynput==1.7.7', a library used for input device control. No code execution, data handling, or network activity is present. The code appears to be a typical package setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this code.",
