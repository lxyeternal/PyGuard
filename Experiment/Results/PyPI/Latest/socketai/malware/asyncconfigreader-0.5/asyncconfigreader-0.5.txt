The main risk stems from potential misuse of the SSL bypass, which could facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks if invoked improperly. The overall security risk is low to moderate, with a malware score of 0 and an obfuscated score of 0."

The low security risk score is appropriate, with the main concern being potential deception if message content is manipulated. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe, with minimal security implications."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code employs techniques often used in malware for persistence and stealth, such as copying files to startup, hiding files, and excluding files from security scans. While these techniques are not inherently malicious, their combination and context could facilitate malicious activities. The current implementation does not show active malicious payloads but warrants caution due to its capabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable; a malware score of approximately 0.3 and a security risk score of about 0.5 reflect moderate suspicion and potential for misuse."

      "conclusion": "The script is not inherently malicious but poses a high security risk if misused. Its ability to silently download and execute arbitrary files from untrusted sources, combined with unsafe subprocess usage and lack of validation, makes it highly exploitable for malicious purposes. The current assessment of malware potential should be increased to reflect this risk."
