{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that executes the 'main()' function from 'main.py' during package setup, which can run arbitrary code at install time.",
  "sources": "Importing 'main' and calling 'main()' in the 'run()' method of the custom 'CrazyInstallStrat' class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during installation, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, potential backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "The 'run()' method calls 'install.run(self)' followed by 'from main import main' and 'main()', creating a source-to-sink flow where code execution occurs during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Executing external code ('main()') during package installation is unusual and suspicious; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present, but the pattern itself is risky.",
  "analysis": "The setup script overrides the install command to execute 'main()' from 'main.py' during installation. This pattern is inherently risky because it allows arbitrary code execution at a critical supply chain point. No obfuscation or secrets are present, but the behavior can be exploited if 'main()' contains malicious code. The pattern is recognized across multiple reports as suspicious and potentially malicious. Given the potential for malicious payloads, the malware score should be high, and the security risk should be elevated accordingly. The code itself is straightforward but dangerous due to its side effects during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation poses a significant security risk, potentially allowing malicious code execution. This behavior should be flagged as high risk, and the package should be reviewed or modified to prevent executing arbitrary code during setup.",
