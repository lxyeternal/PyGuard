{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the installation process for a Python package named 'gym-reschdule_combination' and executes a function from 'main' after installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports data from 'main' within the 'run' method of a custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The 'main' function imported from 'main' could potentially execute arbitrary code, depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method calls 'main' from 'main', which could execute code that is part of the package or dynamically loaded.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' executes 'main()' during installation, which is unusual and potentially suspicious, as it runs code at install time.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that extends setuptools' install class, overriding the run method to execute 'main()' from a local module 'main' immediately after installation. This behavior can be considered malicious or suspicious because executing arbitrary code during package installation can be exploited for malicious purposes. There are no visible hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The package dependencies ('requests' and 'psutil') are common and not suspicious. However, the immediate execution of 'main()' at install time without user consent or transparency is a security concern. This pattern is often associated with malicious or backdoored packages that perform unexpected actions during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is potentially malicious because it executes an external function ('main') during installation, which could be used to run malicious payloads or perform unintended actions. The overall risk is moderate due to this unusual behavior, and the code warrants further inspection of the 'main' module to determine its purpose.",
