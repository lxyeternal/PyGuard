  "purpose": "Setuptools setup script with custom installation behavior that executes a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, particularly 'from main import main' inside the run method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function during the install process.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method calls main(), which may execute arbitrary code from main.py.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes 'main()' without any apparent safeguards, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution during installation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the run method. After standard installation steps, it imports and executes 'main()' from main.py. This behavior is unusual in typical setup scripts, as it triggers code execution during package installation. Without seeing main.py, it's unclear what 'main()' does, but executing it during installation can be malicious if main.py contains harmful code. The package metadata appears benign, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious dependencies. The primary concern is the automatic execution of external code during install, which could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code's main concern is executing 'main()' during installation, which may run arbitrary or malicious code from main.py. While not inherently malicious, this behavior is suspicious and poses security risks, especially if main.py contains harmful logic or if the package is maliciously crafted.",
