  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation step that executes a function from an external module after installation.",
  "sources": "The custom run method in the CrazyInstallStrat class imports and executes main() from the main module.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() from main module during installation, which could potentially execute malicious code if main() is malicious.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the run() method calls main() from main, potentially executing arbitrary code at install time.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes code upon installation without any apparent validation or restriction. The use of run() to invoke main() during install is unusual and risky. No validation or conditionals are present before executing main().",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with a custom install command CrazyInstallStrat. The custom run() method first calls the normal install process, then imports and executes main() from a module named main. This behavior means that whenever the package is installed, it will run the main() function from main.py automatically. This can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as executing arbitrary code during installation, especially if the main module contains malicious code or is maliciously manipulated. The package metadata appears normal. The installation requirements are requests and psutil, which are common and benign. The unusual execution during setup is a significant concern, as it may act as a hidden backdoor or malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script executes arbitrary code during installation by calling main() from main.py, which is potentially malicious behavior. This is an unusual and risky practice that could be exploited for malicious purposes, such as executing unwanted or harmful code on user systems during package installation.",
