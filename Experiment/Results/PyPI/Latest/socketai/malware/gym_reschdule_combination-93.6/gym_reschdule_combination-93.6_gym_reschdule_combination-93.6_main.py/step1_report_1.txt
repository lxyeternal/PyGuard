{
  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data to specific remote URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading MAC addresses, base64 encoding of MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send HTTP GET requests with encoded data in URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) is collected, encoded, and appended as URL parameters, then transmitted over network to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded suspicious URLs likely associated with malicious infrastructure; collection and transmission of system identifiers without user consent; encoding of MAC addresses in base64, which might obscure the data's purpose; no validation or encryption of data transmitted.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains. The URLs appear malicious or used for tracking, given their domain structure. Data is sent via GET requests to these URLs, which can be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or exfiltration. No explicit malicious code such as backdoors, system damage, or data theft beyond information gathering is present. The activity pattern suggests possible privacy violation or tracking behavior. No obfuscation or malware code is detected beyond data exfiltration. The use of external URLs and data collection aligns with behaviors typical of malicious or privacy-invasive scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs system data collection and transmits it to suspicious domains, indicating malicious intent related to user tracking or fingerprinting. No malicious code, backdoors, or system damage actions are present, but the data exfiltration nature and suspicious URLs warrant caution.",
