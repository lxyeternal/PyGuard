All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The scores are justified given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features."

Its behavior is consistent with malware or backdoor components. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the overall threat level is severe."
