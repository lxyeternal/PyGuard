{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the 'info' module within the same package, likely to access constants, functions, or data for the package's functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local 'info' module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "Data flow is from the 'info' module into the current module via import",
  "anomalies": "The use of a wildcard import ('*') can obscure the specific imported elements and potentially introduce unwanted or malicious code if the 'info' module is compromised, but on its own, it is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a wildcard import statement. There are no additional operations, data handling, or external interactions. Wildcard imports are often discouraged because they can hide dependencies and introduce namespace pollution, but they are not necessarily malicious. Without access to the 'info' module's content, it is impossible to determine if malicious code exists there. The snippet itself does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This minimal import statement alone does not indicate malicious behavior. It is a common coding pattern, though potentially risky if the 'info' module is compromised. No malicious activity or security risks are evident in this snippet.",
