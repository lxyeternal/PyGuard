  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue Present?** No, the code is just an import statement; no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** The report correctly notes that 'import *' can be suspicious but cannot confirm malicious intent solely from this line.\n- **Scores:** Confidence (0.4), malware (0), securityRisk (0.2). These seem reasonable given the minimal context.\n- **Justification:** No higher risk score justified; the cautious approach is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue Present?** No, it's a straightforward import with no suspicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** Correctly identifies that this is benign.\n- **Scores:** Confidence (1.0), malware (0), securityRisk (0). High confidence is justified given the simplicity.\n- **Justification:** No reason to increase malware or risk scores.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue Present?** No, similar to previous reports, just an import statement.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** Correctly emphasizes that 'import *' can hide malicious code but cannot confirm malicious intent here.\n- **Scores:** Confidence (0.6), malware (0), securityRisk (0.3). Slightly higher confidence and risk due to cautious stance are acceptable.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious activity; the risk is mainly from the potential for hidden imports.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue Present?** No, the analysis is consistent with previous findings.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** Correctly states that 'import *' can be risky but is not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** Confidence (0.4), malware (0), securityRisk (0.2). Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue Present?** No, again, just an import statement.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** Correctly notes the potential risks of wildcard imports but finds no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Confidence (0.6), malware (0), securityRisk (0.2). Slightly higher confidence due to cautious reasoning is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Scores:** They are generally low, reflecting the minimal context and the caution that 'import *' can hide malicious code but does not confirm it.\n\n### My Final Estimation:\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the overall low risk and malware scores. The main concern with such import statements is the potential for hidden malicious code if the 'info' module is compromised, but no evidence supports this.\n\n**Proposed Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 to 0.3 (caution due to use of 'import *', but no actual malicious activity)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet alone is benign. The use of 'import *' warrants caution but does not constitute a security threat without further context or evidence of malicious content in the 'info' module.",
