  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n- All reports recognize this as a simple relative import of all symbols from the 'info' module.\n- They note that using `import *` can be risky because it obscures what is imported and could hide malicious code if 'info' is malicious.\n- None of the reports find direct evidence of malicious behavior in this line alone.\n- The confidence levels vary from 0.4 to 1.0, reflecting some uncertainty, especially regarding the trustworthiness of the 'info' module.\n- Malware scores are all zero, indicating no direct malicious activity is observed in this snippet.\n- The security risk scores are low, mostly around 0.2–0.3, mainly due to the potential for hidden imports if 'info' is malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- **Issue presence:** The code itself is benign; it’s a standard import statement. There is no evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks in this line alone.\n- **Potential concern:** The use of `import *` can be risky if the 'info' module is malicious or untrusted, but that cannot be confirmed here.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in reasoning:\n- The reports correctly identify the potential risks of wildcard imports but appropriately conclude that no malicious activity is evident from this line alone.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n### Score review:\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low but acknowledge the risk of hidden malicious code if 'info' is compromised.\n- The confidence scores vary but generally reflect the uncertainty about the trustworthiness of 'info'.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.3, which is reasonable given the minimal code and lack of evidence.\n- Since the code is just an import statement, a higher risk score isn't justified unless additional context suggests malicious intent.\n\n### Malware and obfuscated scores:\n- Both are zero across all reports, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Assumptions and claims:\n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious behavior; they only note potential risks associated with the use of `import *`.\n- No claims are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: low malware, low to moderate security risk, and no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2–0.3 (due to potential risks of `import *`, but no actual malicious activity)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (acknowledging the risk of hidden malicious code if 'info' is malicious, but no evidence here)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis code snippet is benign on its own. The main concern is the use of `import *`, which can be risky if the 'info' module is malicious or compromised. Without additional context or inspection of the 'info' module, there's no reason to assign a higher malware or risk score.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, or slightly lower the risk to 0.2, and maintain malware and obfuscated scores at zero.",
