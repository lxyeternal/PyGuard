{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the 'info' module, likely to utilize its data or functions.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the entire 'info' module during execution.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'info' module into the current module via import.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement uses a wildcard import ('*'), which can obscure the actual imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if present in 'info'. However, this alone does not indicate malicious intent; it can be a stylistic or convenience choice.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a wildcard import from a local module, 'info'. There are no other code statements, function calls, or data processing. The use of 'from .info import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code, no suspicious functions, and no apparent data leaks or malicious behaviors are visible. Without inspecting the 'info' module itself, it's impossible to definitively determine if malicious content exists, but based solely on this snippet, there is no clear evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal import statement with no immediate signs of malicious behavior. The only concern is the use of a wildcard import, which could hide malicious code if present in the 'info' module. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this code alone.",
