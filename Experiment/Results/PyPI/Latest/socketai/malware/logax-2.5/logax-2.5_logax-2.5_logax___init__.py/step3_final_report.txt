{
  "purpose": "To import all symbols from the local 'info' module, potentially for use elsewhere in the code.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources are read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; it only imports symbols without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this line; it merely imports symbols from 'info'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can hide imported symbols and potentially introduce namespace pollution; no malicious code is directly visible.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from the 'info' module. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are evident in this line. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which is discouraged because it can hide malicious or unintended imports if 'info' is compromised. Scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2-0.3) due to the potential for hidden imports. Confidence levels vary but are generally justified given the minimal context. Without inspecting 'info', no malicious activity can be confirmed. The code itself is benign, and the main recommendation is to avoid 'import *' for clarity and security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with respect to malicious activity. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which should be avoided in secure coding practices. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No evidence suggests malicious behavior from this snippet alone.",
