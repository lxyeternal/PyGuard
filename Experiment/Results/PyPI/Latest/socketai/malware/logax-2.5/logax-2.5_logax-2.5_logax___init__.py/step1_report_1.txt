{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the 'info' module in the same package, likely for use within the package or script.",
  "sources": "Import statement that reads data from the 'info' module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "Potential data flow from 'info' module to current namespace via import.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .info import *' can be considered suspicious due to its tendency to import all symbols without explicit control, which may hide malicious or unintended imports. However, on its own, this is common in Python packages and not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple import statement using relative import syntax. It imports all symbols from the 'info' module in the current package. Since this is only a single line, there is no evidence of malicious behavior directly visible. The potential concern is the use of wildcard import, which can hide malicious code if 'info' contains malicious payloads, but cannot be determined from this line alone. No other code or context is provided to suggest malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no definitive evidence of malicious behavior. The code is minimal and typical of Python packages, but the use of 'import *' warrants caution if the 'info' module is malicious or untrusted.",
