  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed presence of issues:\n- The code is a straightforward relative import with a wildcard (`import *`).  \n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks are directly visible in this line.  \n- The `info` module's content is unknown, so potential malicious payloads could reside there, but cannot be confirmed from this snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Use of `import *`:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that `import *` can hide which symbols are imported, leading to namespace pollution and potential security concerns if the imported module is malicious or untrusted.  \n- **Assessment of malicious intent:**  \n  All reports agree that the line itself is benign but note the risk if `info` contains malicious code.  \n- **Confidence levels:**  \n  The confidence scores are mostly moderate to high, which seems reasonable given the limited context.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- **No actual evidence of malicious behavior** in the code snippet.  \n- The reports sometimes imply suspicion solely based on the use of `import *`, which is a coding style concern but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate unless there's evidence of malicious code in the `info` module.  \n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  Consistently `0`, which aligns with the simplicity of the code.  \n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Ranges from 0.2 to 0.3, which is reasonable given the use of `import *`.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nGiven the limited context, these scores seem appropriate. If the `info` module is untrusted, the risk could be higher, but from this snippet alone, the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports correctly note that `import *` can hide malicious code but do not assume maliciousness outright.  \n- They avoid jumping to conclusions about malicious behavior solely based on this line, which is good.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and justification:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.  \n- The confidence levels reflect the uncertainty due to lack of context.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (appropriate)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (appropriate)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2-0.3 (appropriate, considering the potential for hidden imports but no evidence)\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- The code itself is benign.  \n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which is generally discouraged but not malicious.  \n- Without inspecting the `info` module, no malicious activity can be confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my judgment:**\n\n| Score Type      | My Estimated Value | Rationale                                               |\n|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                    | No evidence of malicious code in the snippet itself.   |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                    | No obfuscation present.                                |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2 - 0.3            | Use of `import *` can hide malicious imports if `info` is malicious, but no evidence here. |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their cautious approach. The code is minimal and typical, with no immediate security concern. The main recommendation is to avoid `import *` in production code to improve clarity and security, especially if the imported module's trustworthiness is uncertain.",
