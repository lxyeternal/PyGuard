  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local module 'info' within the package",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package/module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in the provided line",
  "flows": "No data flow identifiable from this single import statement",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .info import *' can lead to unclear namespace and potential for hidden or malicious imports if 'info' module is malicious, but not inherently malicious itself",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement that imports all contents from the 'info' module in the same package. There are no direct signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code. However, using 'import *' can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious or unnecessary code. Since only a single line is provided, no further context or data flows can be determined. The module 'info' could contain malicious code, but based solely on this statement, it cannot be confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "This code line is a simple import statement, which by itself does not exhibit malicious behavior. However, the use of 'import *' warrants caution if the 'info' module is untrusted or malicious, as it could introduce hidden or unwanted code. No immediate security risk is evident from this snippet alone.",
