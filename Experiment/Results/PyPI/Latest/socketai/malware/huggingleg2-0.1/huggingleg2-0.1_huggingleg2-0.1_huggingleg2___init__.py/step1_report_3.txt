  "purpose": "Execute a shell command to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote IP address and port.",
  "sources": "os.system() call with a shell command string.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() function executing the command, which creates a reverse shell connection to an external server.",
  "flows": "Input source is the string passed to os.system(), which directly executes a network connection command that redirects shell input/output over the network.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded IP address and port in a reverse shell command, which is a common indicator of malicious activity. No user input or variable substitution involved. The command spawns a Bash shell and redirects I/O over a TCP connection.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and invokes os.system() with a command that starts an interactive Bash shell. The shell's input and output are redirected over TCP to IP 120.55.57.148 on port 8080. This is characteristic of a reverse shell, typically used for remote control or malicious remote access. The code does not sanitize or validate input; it unconditionally executes the reverse shell command. The presence of a hardcoded IP and port strongly suggests malicious intent or backdoor behavior. The code executes immediately upon import, providing no user interaction or safeguards.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs malicious activity by establishing a reverse shell connection to a remote attacker-controlled server. It is a clear security threat, likely used for unauthorized remote access, and should be considered malware. The hardcoded IP and port further confirm its malicious intent.",
