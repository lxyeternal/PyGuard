{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a specified IP address and port.",
  "sources": "os.system() call executing a shell command",
  "sinks": "Reverse shell connection to external IP, potentially allowing remote code execution or control",
  "flows": "os.system() executes command → initiates network connection to attacker-controlled IP and port",
  "anomalies": "Direct execution of shell command with network connection redirection, hardcoded IP and port, reverse shell payload",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and uses os.system() to run a bash command. The command opens a reverse shell by redirecting bash input/output to a remote IP address and port (120.55.57.148:8080). This behavior is typical of malicious backdoors aimed at remote control. No other code or obfuscation is present. The IP and port are hardcoded, indicating an intentional malicious feature designed to provide remote access.",
  "conclusion": "This code explicitly creates a reverse shell connection to an external server, representing malicious behavior intended for remote control or exploitation. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious.",
