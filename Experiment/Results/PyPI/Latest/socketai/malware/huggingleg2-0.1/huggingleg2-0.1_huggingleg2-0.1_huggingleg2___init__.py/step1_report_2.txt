{
  "purpose": "Execute a reverse shell to connect to an external IP address and port.",
  "sources": "os.system call with hardcoded command string",
  "sinks": "os.system executes the shell command which initiates network connection",
  "flows": "Hardcoded reverse shell command flows from source (os.system) to sink (system execution), leading to network connection",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with a reverse shell command; no input validation, hardcoded IP and port, direct execution of network-harming code",
  "analysis": "The code imports os module and immediately calls os.system with a command that opens a reverse shell to IP 120.55.57.148 on port 8080. This behavior indicates malicious intent as it establishes an unauthorized remote connection, which is typical of backdoors or command-and-control channels. The code is straightforward and un-obfuscated, with no apparent attempt to conceal its purpose. It does not rely on user input or external data; the command is hardcoded. The code’s sole purpose appears to be establishing an outbound connection for remote access, which is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, functioning as a reverse shell to an external IP, indicating high malicious intent and security risk. It constitutes a backdoor, posing a severe security threat if used in a production environment.",
