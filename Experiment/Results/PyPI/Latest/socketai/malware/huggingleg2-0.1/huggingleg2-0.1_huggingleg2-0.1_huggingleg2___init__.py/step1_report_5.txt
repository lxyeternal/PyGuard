{
  "purpose": "Establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server, potentially for remote control or unauthorized access.",
  "sources": "os.system call executing a command string",
  "sinks": "Reverse shell connection via /dev/tcp to an external IP and port",
  "flows": "os.system executes the bash command which opens a TCP connection to 120.55.57.148:8080, providing remote shell access",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with a string that invokes a reverse shell is highly suspicious; no input validation or sanitization involved; hardcoded IP and port indicate targeted malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code directly calls os.system with a command that opens a reverse TCP connection to an external server. This behavior resembles typical malicious activity aimed at remote control or data exfiltration. There are no benign reasons for such code in a standard application. The hardcoded IP and port suggest intentional targeting rather than generic functionality. The use of bash to open an interactive reverse shell is a clear indicator of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, implementing a reverse shell to an external server, which can allow an attacker to control the compromised system remotely. It exhibits malicious behavior with no legitimate purpose in normal software operation.",
