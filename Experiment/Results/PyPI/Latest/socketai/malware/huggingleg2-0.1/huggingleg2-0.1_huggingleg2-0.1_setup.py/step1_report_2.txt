  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'huggingleg2' Python package, intended to package and distribute the module.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'X'; os.system command executing a shell command to open a reverse shell.",
  "sinks": "os.system command that initiates a reverse shell connection to an external IP address.",
  "flows": "If the environment variable 'X' is not 'True', the code executes a reverse shell by connecting to 120.55.57.148 on port 8080.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional reverse shell triggered if environment variable 'X' is not set to 'True'. This behavior is suspicious and indicates potential malicious intent. The use of os.system with network redirection is a common technique in malware for remote access.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup from distutils.core and the os module. It then checks if an environment variable 'X' is set to 'True'. If not, it executes a system command that opens a reverse shell to an external server. This is a highly suspicious behavior, as it allows remote access to the host system without user consent. The setup() function is standard for packaging, but it is overshadowed by the malicious code. The reverse shell code is executed unconditionally unless the environment variable 'X' is explicitly set, which indicates a backdoor or malicious intent. No other code or logic is present that mitigates or limits this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious backdoor that opens a reverse shell to an external IP address, which is a serious security threat. The presence of this reverse shell indicates malicious intent and compromises the security of the system running this script.",
