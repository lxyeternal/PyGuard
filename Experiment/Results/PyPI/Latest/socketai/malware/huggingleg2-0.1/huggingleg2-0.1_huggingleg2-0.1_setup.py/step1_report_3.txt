  "purpose": "Define and set up a Python package named 'huggingleg2'.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'X', executing a system command to open a reverse shell via Bash.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing a Bash command that opens a network connection to an external IP address and port.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'X' check -> if condition met, executes reverse shell command via os.system() -> package setup continues.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional reverse shell attempt triggered when environment variable 'X' is not set to 'True'. The network connection to external IP (120.55.57.148) and port (8080) indicates malicious intent. No other suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing 'setup' from distutils.core and os module. It then checks if the environment variable 'X' is not equal to 'True'. If the condition holds, it executes a system call that opens a reverse shell connection to an external server IP 120.55.57.148 on port 8080, which is a malicious action. The setup() function defines a package 'huggingleg2'. The reverse shell code is executed unconditionally if the environment variable 'X' is not 'True', indicating potential backdoor behavior. The rest of the code is standard package setup and does not contain any other suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a clear malicious behavior: it establishes a reverse shell connection to an external IP unless a specific environment variable is set. This constitutes a serious security risk and indicates intent to compromise or remotely control systems running this code. The code is not obfuscated, but it performs malicious activity based on simple environment variable logic.",
