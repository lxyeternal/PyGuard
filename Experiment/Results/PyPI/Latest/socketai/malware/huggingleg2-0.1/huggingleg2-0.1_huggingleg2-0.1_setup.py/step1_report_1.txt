  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package named 'huggingleg2' for distribution.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'X' and the os.system call that executes a shell command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call that executes a reverse shell connection to IP 120.55.57.148 on port 8080.",
  "flows": "If environment variable 'X' is not 'True', the code executes a reverse shell to the specified IP, then proceeds with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of a reverse shell if environment variable 'X' is not 'True'. The setup function appears normal but is preceded by potentially malicious code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing 'setup' from distutils.core and the 'os' module. It checks the environment variable 'X', and if it does not equal 'True', it runs a shell command that opens a reverse TCP connection to a remote IP, which is a typical backdoor behavior. This reverse shell is a clear malicious action. The setup function then proceeds to define a Python package. The presence of the reverse shell triggered under a specific environment variable indicates malicious intent, likely intended to create a backdoor on the host system. The rest of the code (package setup) appears normal but is tainted by the preceding malicious command.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious reverse shell that executes when the environment variable 'X' is not set to 'True'. This indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent with an active security risk. The package setup code itself is benign but is used here as a vehicle for malicious activity.",
