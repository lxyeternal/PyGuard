  "purpose": "To set up and install the 'huggingleg2' Python package.",
  "sources": "Environment variable check 'os.environ.get('X')' and the 'os.system' call executing a bash command.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' command executes a reverse shell connection to an external IP address, which could lead to remote code execution or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'X' is checked; if not equal to 'True', the code executes a reverse shell to 120.55.57.148:8080.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional reverse shell triggered unless environment variable 'X' is set to 'True'. The reverse shell command is hardcoded, connecting to an external IP and port. This behavior is suspicious and atypical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'distutils.core.setup' and 'os' modules. It then checks if the environment variable 'X' is set to 'True'. If not, it executes a bash command that opens a reverse shell to a specific IP address and port, providing remote control access. The setup function configures the package with a name, package list, and version, which appears normal. However, the inclusion of a reverse shell in a setup script is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent, potentially allowing remote attacker access during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by executing a reverse shell connection during package setup, which is a severe security risk. This indicates an attempt to include malicious code within what appears to be a normal setup script, likely aimed at system compromise or unauthorized access.",
