  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'huggingleg2' for distribution.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'X' and the os.system call executing a bash command with a TCP reverse shell.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call that executes a reverse shell connection to an external IP address.",
  "flows": "If the environment variable 'X' is not 'True', the code executes a reverse shell connecting to IP 120.55.57.148 on port 8080.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a reverse shell payload that connects back to an external IP address, which is unusual and suspicious in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from distutils.core and the os module. It then checks if environment variable 'X' is not 'True'; if so, it executes a system command that opens a reverse TCP shell to a specific IP and port. This behavior indicates malicious intent, likely to compromise the system by giving remote access. The setup() function defines package metadata and does not contain any suspicious code. The malicious code is hidden in a conditional that triggers a reverse shell, which is a common backdoor tactic.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious payload that opens a reverse shell to an external IP when the environment variable 'X' is not set to 'True'. This is indicative of malicious behavior aimed at unauthorized remote access. The package's setup process appears legitimate but is exploited to deliver the backdoor.",
