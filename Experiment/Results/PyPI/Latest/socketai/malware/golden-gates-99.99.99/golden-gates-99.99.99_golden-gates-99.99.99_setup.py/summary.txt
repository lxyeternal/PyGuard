  "conclusion": "The code performs automatic collection and exfiltration of system information during package installation, indicating malicious or highly suspicious behavior. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and system commands for data gathering without user consent confirms malicious intent. The scores should reflect this high risk, with a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9. The code is not obfuscated, and the activity aligns with typical data theft or reconnaissance malware."
