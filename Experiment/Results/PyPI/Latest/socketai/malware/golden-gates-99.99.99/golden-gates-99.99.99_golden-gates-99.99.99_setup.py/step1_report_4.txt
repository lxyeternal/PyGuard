  "purpose": "Custom installation script that collects system information and sends it to a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads system info via os.popen() and os.system() commands, including 'uname', 'ifconfig', 'curl', 'whoami', and 'hostname'.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data to a remote Slack webhook URL using os.system() with a curl command.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system commands (sources) is concatenated into a JSON payload and sent via an external curl command to the webhook URL (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unconditionally gathers and transmits detailed system information (host, user, IP, OS info) during package installation, with no apparent user consent or opt-out. Uses os.popen() and os.system() which are less secure and can execute arbitrary commands. The webhook URL is hardcoded, revealing potential exfiltration. No validation or sanitization of inputs. The code operates silently without user awareness.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install process that, during package installation, collects various system details such as OS info, current working directory, IP addresses, username, hostname, and a fixed string. It then constructs a JSON payload containing these details and sends it to a Slack webhook URL using a curl command executed via os.system(). The commands used ('uname', 'ifconfig', 'curl', 'systeminfo', 'tasklist', etc.) are standard for gathering system info. However, the unconditional data collection and exfiltration during installation, especially sending sensitive system information to an external server, strongly suggests malicious behavior or at least suspicious activity. There are no safeguards, user prompts, or opt-outs; the code operates silently and automatically during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to gather detailed system information and send it to an external webhook during package installation, which is indicative of malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. It could be used for system fingerprinting or data exfiltration without user consent. The core malicious aspect is the automated exfiltration of system info via a hardcoded webhook during installation.",
