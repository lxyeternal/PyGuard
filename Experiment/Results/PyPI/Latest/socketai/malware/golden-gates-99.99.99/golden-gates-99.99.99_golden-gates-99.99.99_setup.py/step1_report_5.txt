{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include 'sys.platform', 'os.popen' commands for system info, 'os.getcwd()' for current directory, and 'os.popen('whoami')' and 'hostname' commands for user and host details.",
  "sinks": "The code executes 'os.system' to perform an HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook, transmitting collected system info as a JSON payload.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system commands (sources) into variables, which are then interpolated into a JSON string in the 'os.system' call, resulting in the transmission of data to an external endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "The code actively collects detailed system info and sends it over the network during package installation, which is unusual behavior for a package setup script. The 'public_ip' variable is assigned using 'curl ifconfig.me', which can reveal the host's external IP address. The use of 'os.popen' and 'os.system' to execute shell commands dynamically during install time is potentially suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom 'install' class that overrides the 'run' method. During installation, it collects system information based on the platform: 'uname -a' for Unix-like systems, 'systeminfo' and 'ipconfig' for Windows, and 'curl ifconfig.me' for external IP. It also gathers current directory and user/hostname info. Instead of simply installing, it immediately performs a network request to a specified Slack webhook URL, sending a JSON payload containing the collected data. This behavior resembles data exfiltration, which is atypical for a standard package installation process and raises security concerns. The use of hardcoded webhook URL, active network communication, and system info collection during setup indicates potentially malicious intent, such as unauthorized data collection or backdoor activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting detailed system information and transmitting it to an external webhook during package installation. This could be indicative of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration or a backdoor. While some data collection might be benign in certain contexts, embedding such behavior within a setup script is unusual and potentially malicious.",
