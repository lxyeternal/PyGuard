  "purpose": "Custom installation script that gathers system information and sends it to a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": [
    "os.popen() calls for 'uname', 'ifconfig', 'curl', 'whoami', 'hostname', and 'systeminfo'.",

  "flows": [
    "Information is collected via os.popen() calls (sources) and then transmitted over the network through os.system() using curl (sink)."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "The script collects potentially sensitive system information (hostname, username, IP configurations, system details) and immediately transmits it to an external Slack webhook.",
    "Use of os.popen() and os.system() for data collection and transmission instead of secure APIs or libraries.",
    "The webhook URL is hardcoded, which could be malicious if the package is intended to exfiltrate data.",
    "The script runs commands based on OS detection, including Windows and Linux-specific commands, indicating an intent to gather comprehensive system data."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the install process, gathers system details such as hostname, current directory, IP configuration, and user info. It then constructs a message and sends it to a specified Slack webhook URL using a curl command executed via os.system(). The use of os.popen() and os.system() to execute commands and transmit data is risky, as it can be exploited for data exfiltration or remote command execution if misused. The hardcoded webhook URL suggests the code is designed to send sensitive system information to an external endpoint without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. No other malicious behaviors such as code injection, backdoors, or crypto-mining are detected, but the activity of exfiltrating system info during installation is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be malicious or at least suspicious, as it automatically collects detailed system info and exfiltrates it via a hardcoded webhook during installation, with no user prompt or obvious benign purpose. This behavior resembles data exfiltration tactics often seen in malicious packages.",
