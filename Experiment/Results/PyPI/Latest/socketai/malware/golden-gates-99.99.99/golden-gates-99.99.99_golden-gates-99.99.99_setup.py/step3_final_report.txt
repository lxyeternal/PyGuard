{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to run during package installation, collecting system information and exfiltrating it via a POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls to execute system commands (uname, ifconfig, curl, systeminfo, ipconfig, whoami, hostname), and os.system() executing curl for data transmission.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing curl command with embedded JSON payload, transmitting data to external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data is collected via os.popen() calls, stored in variables, then embedded into a JSON string which is sent via os.system() executing curl to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data collection and exfiltration during installation without user consent; use of standard commands for info gathering; hardcoded webhook URL; no obfuscation; no error handling or user notification.",
  "analysis": "The code executes during package installation, collecting sensitive system info such as hostname, user, IP configuration, OS details, and current directory. It constructs a JSON payload with this info and transmits it via a curl POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL using os.system(). The behavior is consistent across platforms, with different commands for Windows and Unix-like systems. The activity resembles data exfiltration or reconnaissance, especially given the lack of user consent and the use of a hardcoded external URL. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and employs common system commands, but its purpose appears malicious or at least highly suspicious. The use of standard commands and direct transmission of sensitive info during install is a significant security concern. The malware score should be high, reflecting malicious intent, and the security risk score should also be high due to potential privacy invasion and data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs automatic collection and exfiltration of system information during package installation, indicating malicious or highly suspicious behavior. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and system commands for data gathering without user consent confirms malicious intent. The scores should reflect this high risk, with a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9. The code is not obfuscated, and the activity aligns with typical data theft or reconnaissance malware.",
