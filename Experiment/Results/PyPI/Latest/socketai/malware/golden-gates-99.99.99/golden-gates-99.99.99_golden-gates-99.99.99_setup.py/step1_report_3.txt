  "purpose": "Custom installation script for a Python package that collects system information and posts it to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads system info via os.popen() (uname, ifconfig, curl, systeminfo, ipconfig, whoami, hostname). Uses os.getcwd() for current directory. Receives data via system commands.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing a curl command that posts collected data to a Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Collects system info and user info via os.popen(). Constructs a JSON payload string embedded in os.system() call. Sends data over the network to a Slack webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.popen() for executing commands that collect sensitive system info and then sending it over the network without any validation or user consent. Hardcoded webhook URL and payload formatting suggest data exfiltration. The script runs during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the run() method. It gathers various system details based on the OS type using os.popen() commands. It then constructs a JSON message containing this information and sends it via a curl POST request to a Slack webhook URL. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the data includes hostname, user info, and system details. The script executes during package installation, which could be used to surreptitiously exfiltrate system info without user knowledge. The network activity and data collection are suspicious, especially since the data is sent over a plain HTTP POST to a third-party URL with no user consent or apparent purpose related to the package's functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs covert data collection during package installation and exfiltrates sensitive system information to an external Slack webhook. The behavior indicates malicious intent or at least a severe security concern. It could be used for system reconnaissance or data theft. The use of standard commands for info gathering combined with network transmission during install is highly suspicious.",
