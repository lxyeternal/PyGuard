  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to gather system information and send it to a remote Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls to execute system commands and retrieve system info; os.system() to execute a curl command that sends data to a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "os.system() with a curl command that posts data to an external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data from system commands (e.g., uname, ifconfig, hostname, whoami) flows into a string formatted for a POST request, which is then sent via curl to the webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.popen() and os.system() to execute system commands, collecting potentially sensitive information such as hostname, current user, IP configuration, and system info, and sending this data externally without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to run custom steps during package installation. It collects system information depending on the OS platform using os.popen(), which can execute arbitrary system commands. It then formats this information into a JSON payload and sends it via a curl POST request to a specified Slack webhook URL. The information collected includes system configuration, hostname, current user, and network details, which could be sensitive. The data transmission occurs automatically during installation, which is suspicious behavior for a package, as it may compromise user privacy or leak sensitive data without explicit consent. There are no hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors, but the act of collecting and exfiltrating system data during install without user knowledge is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and automatically transmitting it to an external service during installation. This pattern suggests potential privacy invasion or malicious data exfiltration. While there are no clear backdoors or malicious payloads, the behavior is unethical and potentially harmful from a security perspective.",
