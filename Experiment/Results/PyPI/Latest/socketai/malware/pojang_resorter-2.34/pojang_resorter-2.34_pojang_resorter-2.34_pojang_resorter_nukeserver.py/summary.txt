  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign and straightforward, primarily posing a risk through executing an external binary that may be malicious. No malicious logic or obfuscation is present within the script. The main security concern is ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of 'windows.exe' before execution. Therefore, the malware score should be low, and the security risk moderate, reflecting the external dependency's trustworthiness."
