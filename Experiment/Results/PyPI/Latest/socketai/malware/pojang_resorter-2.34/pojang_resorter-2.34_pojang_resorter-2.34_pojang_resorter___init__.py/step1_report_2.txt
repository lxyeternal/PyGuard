  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool by importing the main function.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main import main",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; the code only imports a module and sets metadata",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and imports a main function from a local module. It lacks data handling, input processing, or network activity. No security issues, malicious code, or anomalies are apparent. The simplicity indicates it's a typical module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets metadata and imports a core function, typical for Python package modules.",
