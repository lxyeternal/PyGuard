{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a package initialization script, importing a local module and setting metadata variables for version and author information.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from the module import (.main) and sets metadata variables (__version__, __author__). No external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the import statement to the module's namespace; no external data flows or untrusted data processing occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package setup script with no dynamic behavior, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The import is from a local module, and no secrets or obfuscation are used. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the code's clarity and minimalism.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate; the security risk is negligible, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
