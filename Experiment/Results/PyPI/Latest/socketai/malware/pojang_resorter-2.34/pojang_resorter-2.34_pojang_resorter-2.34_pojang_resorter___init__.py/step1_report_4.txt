{
  "purpose": "Provides basic metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Imports 'main' from the local module '.main'. Reads metadata such as '__version__' and '__author__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a package docstring, an import statement, and version/author metadata. There are no signs of data input, external data fetching, or potentially malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, no suspicious functions, no network activity, and no handling of sensitive data. The import is a local module, and no runtime data manipulation occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions solely as a package initialization file with metadata and import statements.",
