{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, mainly by importing the main module and setting version and author metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module, metadata variables (__version__, __author__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs, no data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only imports a module and sets variables",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution; very minimalistic and standard structure",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local main module, sets version and author metadata variables. There are no inputs, no outputs, no dynamic code execution, and no external data sources or sinks. The structure is typical for a package initialization file. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It only sets metadata and imports a main module, posing no security risks.",
