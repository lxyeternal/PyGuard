{
  "purpose": "Provides a CLI tool with ASCII art and command descriptions for interacting with a Minecraft Mojang-related application.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine which subcommand to display.",
  "sinks": "None of the code processes untrusted input beyond parsing arguments; no data is outputted to external systems or stored.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments flows into argparse parsing, then triggers help display. No further data flows or processing occur.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. The ASCII art and colorized output do not involve any obfuscation or malicious obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored CLI output, defines a function to show help with ASCII art and command descriptions, and then calls this function if run as the main module. The help message includes subcommands for server management tasks. There are no external data transmissions, no dynamic code execution, and no use of untrusted data sources beyond command-line arguments. The code appears to be a benign CLI utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward CLI help utility with ASCII art and command descriptions. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a benign utility intended for user guidance.",
