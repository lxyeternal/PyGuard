{
  "purpose": "Provide a CLI help interface with ASCII art and command descriptions for a Python-based interaction tool.",
  "sources": "argparse for command-line arguments, input via command line (not explicitly reading external data sources).",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or output manipulation involving untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "User input via command line flows through argparse to determine which subcommand is invoked, but no further data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are detected. Use of colorama is benign, used solely for colored terminal output.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored terminal output and defines a function to display ASCII art along with command descriptions. It uses argparse to set up subcommands for server initialization, preview, help display, and operator assignment. The ASCII art and command descriptions are static, hardcoded strings. No external data sources, network connections, or sensitive data handling are present. The code is structured to provide user interface output only, with no evident malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI help display utility with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply outputs ASCII art and command descriptions for user guidance.",
