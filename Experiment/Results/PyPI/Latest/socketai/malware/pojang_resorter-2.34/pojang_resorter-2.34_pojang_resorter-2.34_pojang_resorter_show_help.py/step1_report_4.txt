{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface with help display and subcommands related to server and user management.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine user commands.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; no external network, file, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "User inputs command arguments, which are processed to display help and ASCII art.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of colorama appears solely for display purposes. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a CLI tool with ASCII art and colored headers. It defines multiple subcommands but does not process or act upon input beyond displaying help messages. No external data sources, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code structure and logic are straightforward, with no suspicious functions or data flows. Overall, the code is benign and solely for user interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a CLI help display with ASCII art and command descriptions. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks. It appears to be a harmless utility script.",
