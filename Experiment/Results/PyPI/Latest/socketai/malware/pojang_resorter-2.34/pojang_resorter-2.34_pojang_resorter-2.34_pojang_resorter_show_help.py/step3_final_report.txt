  "purpose": "Display ASCII art and command help information for a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Static strings for ASCII art, command descriptions, and color codes.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from code to terminal output; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, straightforward code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a function to display ASCII art and help messages with subcommands, and executes this function if run as main. It contains only static strings and no external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The use of colorama is purely cosmetic. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present, and the code is structurally sound.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help utility with static ASCII art and command descriptions. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0.",
