{
  "purpose": "Decodes and executes a hidden payload from an obfuscated string, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is the obfuscated string assigned to the variable within the exec statement.",
  "sinks": "exec function executes the decompressed and decoded payload, which is potentially malicious code.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated string is reversed, base64-decoded, then zlib-decompressed, and finally executed via exec.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda to perform multiple decoding steps, reversing the string, layered encoding, obfuscated payload, and immediate execution via exec. No explicit hardcoded credentials but complex obfuscation raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an anonymous lambda function that imports zlib and base64 modules to decompress data. It then applies this function to an obfuscated payload, which is first reversed, base64-decoded, then zlib-decompressed. The result is passed directly to exec, executing potentially malicious code. The obfuscation and immediate execution strongly suggest malicious intent or malicious payload delivery. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are evident; the entire payload is hardcoded but hidden through multiple layers of encoding and reversing.",
  "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious due to layered obfuscation, use of dynamic execution, and data decoding steps. It likely aims to hide malicious code, which is executed immediately, posing a significant security risk.",
