  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface for executing specific server management commands, including executing other scripts or functions based on user input.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments ('command' and 'extra_args')",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution for script calls, dynamic import of modules/functions, logging of errors",
  "flows": "Command-line argument 'command' determines which script or function is invoked, with optional additional arguments passed to scripts or functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data; dynamic imports based on user input could be risky if command mappings are altered, but currently they are fixed. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging and defines a function to execute commands based on a mapping. Commands trigger either subprocess calls to scripts or dynamic imports of functions from specific modules. User input is used to determine which command to run, with defaulting to 'initialize_server' if none is provided. The subprocess commands are fixed and do not directly incorporate untrusted data into command strings; they rely on a predefined mapping. Dynamic imports are controlled via a fixed command map, minimizing the risk of arbitrary code execution. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code behaviors are present. The code appears to be a controlled CLI wrapper around server management scripts, with standard security practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a command dispatcher for server management tasks with controlled command mappings. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The dynamic import and subprocess execution are managed via fixed mappings, reducing risks. Overall, it appears safe with no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
