  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a command dispatcher that executes scripts or functions based on user input, with fixed command mappings. No malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code uses a command map to control which scripts/functions are invoked.\n  - Dynamic imports are limited to specific commands, reducing risk.\n  - Subprocess calls are to fixed script paths, with arguments passed directly, but only from predefined commands.\n  - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n  - Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning appears sound. The code is a controlled CLI wrapper with minimal security risk. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with emphasis on external modules and scripts. Potential risk if external modules/scripts are malicious, but none are shown here.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Uses command validation, but external modules/functions could be malicious if compromised.\n  - Subprocess execution could be risky if scripts are malicious or replaced.\n  - No malicious code in this snippet.\n  - Risk is acknowledged as higher due to reliance on external code.\n  - Confidence: 0.75, malware: 0, risk: 0.3.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report correctly identifies external dependencies as a potential risk but finds no malicious activity within this code. The reasoning is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar command dispatcher, with controlled command mapping. External modules/functions could be malicious if compromised.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code validates commands, limiting arbitrary execution.\n  - External modules/functions are imported and called, which could be malicious if those modules are compromised.\n  - Subprocess calls are to scripts that could be malicious if tampered with.\n  - No malicious code is visible here.\n  - Risk is low but depends on external modules/scripts.\n  - Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, risk: 0.2.\n\n- **Verdict:** The analysis is consistent. No malicious activity detected; external dependencies are the main concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with emphasis on the potential for exploitation via subprocess and dynamic imports.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Accepts user input, executes scripts, and imports functions.\n  - No validation of 'extra_args' beyond passing them to scripts/functions.\n  - External scripts/modules could be malicious if compromised.\n  - No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n  - Slightly higher risk score (0.4) reflects the potential for exploitation via external scripts or modules.\n  - Confidence: 0.8.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The main concern is external scripts/modules, not the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar dispatcher with potential command injection risks due to subprocess calls and dynamic imports, especially since 'extra_args' are passed directly.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Uses subprocess with user-controlled arguments, no sanitization.\n  - Imports functions from external modules, which could be malicious.\n  - Potential for command injection or malicious code execution if external scripts or modules are compromised.\n  - No malicious code present here, but the design allows for malicious external components.\n  - Risk score: 0.5, which is high but justified given the potential.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is appropriate. The main concern is external components and lack of input sanitization.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a command dispatcher that relies heavily on external scripts/modules.\n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are present within this code snippet.\n- The main security risks stem from external scripts/modules and the use of subprocess with user-controlled arguments without sanitization.\n- The scores assigned are generally reasonable, with malware scores at 0, as no malicious code is detected within the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Varies from 0.2 to 0.5, reflecting the potential risk from external dependencies and subprocess usage.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.3 (moderate, due to external dependencies and subprocess risks)\n- **Justification:** The code itself is straightforward and controlled, but external scripts and modules could be malicious if compromised. The subprocess calls and dynamic imports are potential vectors, but within this code, they are managed via fixed mappings.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears safe but relies on external components that could introduce risks. Proper validation, sanitization, and integrity checks of external scripts/modules are recommended to mitigate potential supply chain threats.",
