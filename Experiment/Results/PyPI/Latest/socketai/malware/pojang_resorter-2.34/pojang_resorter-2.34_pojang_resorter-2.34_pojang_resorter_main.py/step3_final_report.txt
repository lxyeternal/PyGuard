{
  "purpose": "A command-line interface tool that executes predefined server management scripts or functions based on user input.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, external modules ('pojangi_resorter.forceop', 'pojang_resorter.nukeserver'), and script files invoked via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing scripts with user-provided arguments, dynamic imports of external modules/functions.",
  "flows": "User input → command validation → execution via subprocess or import → external scripts/functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; reliance on external scripts/modules without validation; passing user arguments directly to subprocess calls without sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a controlled command dispatcher mapping specific commands to scripts or functions, with command validation limiting arbitrary execution. External modules and scripts are invoked dynamically, which could be malicious if compromised, but no malicious code is present within this snippet. Subprocess calls use fixed script paths, reducing risk, but passing user arguments directly introduces potential command injection if external scripts are malicious. The code does not contain obfuscation or embedded malware. The primary security concern is external dependencies and the lack of input sanitization for subprocess arguments. Overall, the code appears safe and well-structured, with risks mainly stemming from external components outside the code's scope.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward, controlled CLI wrapper for server management scripts/functions. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security risk involves external scripts/modules that could be malicious if compromised, especially given the direct passing of user arguments to subprocess calls. Ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of external dependencies and sanitizing input can mitigate these risks.",
