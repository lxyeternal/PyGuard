  "purpose": "Assign operator privileges to a user on a Minecraft server via RCON commands.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for username, server IP, RCON port, and RCON password.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'op' command through the mcrcon library, sending data to the Minecraft server.",
  "flows": "User inputs (username, server IP, port, password) flow into the assign_operator function, which constructs and sends the command via the RCON connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; standard use of libraries and command execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard libraries to connect to a Minecraft server and assign operator privileges based on user input. It handles exceptions and logs activities appropriately. The only security consideration is that the RCON password is passed via command-line argument, which could be exposed in process listings or logs, but this is a common pattern and not malicious. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting operational risks rather than inherent vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is a legitimate utility with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a legitimate administrative task without malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the exposure of sensitive credentials via command-line arguments, which can be mitigated by alternative credential handling methods. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, aligning with the analysis.",
