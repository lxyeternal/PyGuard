  "purpose": "This script assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server using RCON protocol.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from command-line arguments: username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password.",
  "sinks": "The mcr.command call that executes 'op {username}' on the Minecraft server, which could alter server privileges.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in the command to the server; the username flows into the RCON command that elevates privileges.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of standard logging; no suspicious code structures. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts user inputs for server connection details and username, then establishes an RCON connection to execute an 'op' command, which grants operator status. The script includes logging of connection and errors, and proper exception handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or destructive actions. The use of the 'mcrcon' library and direct command execution appears to be intended for legitimate server management purposes. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present that suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward Minecraft server management tool designed to assign operator privileges. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks beyond normal operational considerations for such a tool. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
