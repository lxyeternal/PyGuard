  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing their reasoning, and adjusting scores if necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard build/release automation with Invoke.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, sys.path modifications, hardcoded credentials.\n- **Sinks:** Shell commands, environment, external modules.\n- **Flow:** Environment variables influence behavior; hardcoded secrets in code.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded passwords ('password' in 'sanity_test_from_v1' and 'travis' config), sys.path manipulation, environment variables.\n- **Analysis:** No active malware or obfuscation. Hardcoded secrets are security risks but not malicious per se.\n- **Conclusion:** Mostly standard automation with some risky practices.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The security risk is moderate due to hardcoded secrets, but no malicious activity. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated 0. The security risk score at 0.45 seems reasonable, but perhaps slightly conservative given the credentials.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Keep as is or slightly lower, e.g., 0.4, since no active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar automation tasks.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, hardcoded credentials ('fabric<2', 'sikrit', 'some-gateway', 'mypass', 'admin', 'localghost', '2222').\n- **Sinks:** Shell commands, network connections.\n- **Flow:** Credentials and environment variables influence commands and network configs.\n- **Anomalies:** Multiple hardcoded secrets, environment modifications, sys.path manipulation.\n- **Analysis:** Credentials like 'mypass', 'sikrit', 'localghost', 'admin' are sensitive. No evidence of malicious payloads, but credentials could be exploited.\n- **Conclusion:** Security risks are higher here due to multiple secrets.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is solid. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate—no malware is evident, just risky secrets. The security risk score at 0.6 is justified.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build/test/release automation.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, hardcoded credentials ('env.password'='sikrit', 'env.gateway', 'env.user', 'env.host_string', 'env.port').\n- **Sinks:** Shell commands, network connections.\n- **Flow:** Credentials influence network configs and build commands.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets, environment manipulations.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to previous, no malicious payloads but insecure handling of secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Moderate security risk, no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The malware score is 0, as expected. Security risk at 0.6 seems appropriate.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build/test automation.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, passwords ('sikrit', 'mypass') in code.\n- **Sinks:** Shell commands, environment variables.\n- **Flow:** Credentials influence commands and environment.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded passwords, sys.path manipulation.\n- **Analysis:** Similar concerns—no malicious activity, but insecure secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk, no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. Malware score 0, obfuscated 0. Appropriate. Security risk 0.3 is justified, given the presence of secrets.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard build/test/deploy.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, credentials ('password', 'user') in code.\n- **Sinks:** Commands, environment.\n- **Flow:** Credentials influence commands.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just insecure secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasoning is correct. Malware score 0, obfuscated 0. Correct. Security risk 0.3 seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious payloads or malware are present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations, but generally justified by the presence of hardcoded secrets and environment manipulations.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' findings.\n- The main concern is the presence of hardcoded credentials, which, while not malicious, pose security risks.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n\n**Risk:** Considering the repeated presence of hardcoded secrets and environment manipulations, I would assign a **risk score around 0.5**, reflecting moderate security concern but no active malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | My estimate |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| Malware        | 0            |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            |\n| Risk           | 0.5          |\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the observed code practices.",
