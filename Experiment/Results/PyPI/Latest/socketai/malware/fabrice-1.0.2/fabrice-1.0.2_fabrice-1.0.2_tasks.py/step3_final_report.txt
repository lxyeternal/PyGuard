  "purpose": "Build, test, and release automation scripts using Invoke, with environment and credential handling.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, sys.path modifications, hardcoded credentials (e.g., passwords, tokens, hostnames).",
  "sinks": "Shell commands, network connections, environment variables, module imports.",
  "flows": "Credentials and environment variables influence build and network configurations; data flows from hardcoded secrets to commands and network setup.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded passwords ('password', 'mypass', 'sikrit', 'admin', 'localghost', '2222'), sys.path manipulations, environment variable modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical build and deployment tasks but contains hardcoded secrets and environment modifications that pose security risks. No malicious payloads, network exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. The security concerns are related to secret exposure rather than active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard automation with security weaknesses due to embedded secrets and environment manipulation. No malware or obfuscation detected. The security risk score should reflect moderate concern, primarily from secret exposure, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0.",
