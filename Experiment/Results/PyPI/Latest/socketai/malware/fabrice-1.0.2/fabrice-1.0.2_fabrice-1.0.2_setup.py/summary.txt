  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration with no malicious intent. The primary concern is the use of exec() to read version info, which should be secured by ensuring the integrity of '_version.py'. No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily due to the exec() pattern, which is common but should be handled cautiously."
