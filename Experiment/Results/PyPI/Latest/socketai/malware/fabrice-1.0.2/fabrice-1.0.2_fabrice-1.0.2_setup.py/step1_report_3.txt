  "purpose": "Configure package setup parameters, determine package version, and set up entry points for a Python package related to SSH automation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', file reads ('_version.py', 'README.rst')",
  "sinks": "None present that process untrusted data directly; file reads are from local filesystem, environment variable is from OS environment",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences package name and binary; reading version info from local file; reading long description from local file",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to evaluate '_version.py' content, which could be malicious if the file content is compromised or maliciously modified",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads environment variables, local files, and performs package configuration with setuptools. The environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2' influences package selection. The version is obtained via executing '_version.py' using 'exec', which poses a risk if that file is malicious or tampered with, as 'exec' can execute arbitrary code. File reads are standard for setup scripts, and no network or secret handling is present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident aside from the use of 'exec' to read version info, which is a known but risky pattern. There are no backdoors, hidden malicious code, or malicious network activity. The code's structure and functions are typical of setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a minor security concern regarding the use of 'exec' to evaluate the '_version.py' file. No malicious intent, malware, or suspicious activity detected. The use of 'exec' warrants caution but is common in setup scripts for version extraction. Overall, the script is safe but should ensure that '_version.py' cannot be tampered with.",
