{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, determining package and binary names based on environment variables and directory checks, reading version info from a local '_version.py' via exec(), and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', filesystem checks for 'fabric' and 'fabric2' directories, reading '_version.py' file, reading 'README.rst' file.",
  "sinks": "exec() call on '_version.py' content, reading files from disk (safe in context), environment variables, filesystem checks.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks influence package and binary naming; reading '_version.py' and executing its content assigns version; reading README for description; setup configuration uses these values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to read version info from '_version.py' could be risky if the file is tampered with; no network activity, secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script with conditional naming based on environment and directory presence. The main security concern is the use of exec() on a local version file, which could execute malicious code if the file is compromised. However, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and aligns with common practices, with the exec() pattern being a known but potentially risky method for version extraction. The scores assigned by the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk around 0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration with no malicious intent. The primary concern is the use of exec() to read version info, which should be secured by ensuring the integrity of '_version.py'. No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily due to the exec() pattern, which is common but should be handled cautiously.",
