{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package named 'fabrice' or 'fabrice2' with dependencies and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2), reads the README file, and reads the _version.py file within the package.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the exec() call to execute code from _version.py, and the reading of files (README.rst and _version.py) which could potentially be manipulated if those files are malicious or tampered with.",
  "flows": "Environment variable PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2 -> determines package and binary names; Reading README.rst -> long_description; Reading _version.py -> sets version; Files used in setup() for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from _version.py is potentially risky if the file content is malicious or tampered with. No other suspicious code like network activity, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs setup configuration for packaging, with careful handling of version info through reading a file rather than importing, reducing risk. The exec() call on _version.py is a common pattern but could be exploited if the file is maliciously altered. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present. The code uses environment variables to determine package behavior, which is standard practice. Overall, the script is typical for a setup process with minimal security concern outside the exec() call.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evident malicious intent. The only potential concern is the use of exec() to evaluate the _version.py file, which could be risky if the file is compromised, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
