{
  "purpose": "This script configures the setup process for a Python package named 'fabrice' or 'fabrice2', setting dependencies, metadata, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2'; filesystem reads for directory existence and file contents ('_version.py' and 'README.rst')",
  "sinks": "exec() function to execute code from '_version.py'; reading files (README.rst, '_version.py') for version info",
  "flows": "Environment variable check -> Directory existence checks -> Conditional assignment -> Reading version info from file -> Executing '_version.py' code -> Reading README file -> Passing parameters to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run contents of '_version.py' without validation; reading files directly without sanitization; no apparent validation or encryption of inputs",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup configuration for a Python package. The environment variable influences package naming but does not introduce malicious behavior. Directory checks determine package configuration. The use of exec() on '_version.py' is common for version retrieval, but it can be risky if the file is tampered with. Files read are static documentation files, with no indication of malicious content. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious code are present. No obfuscation techniques are used; the code structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration script with no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. The only minor concern is the use of exec() for reading version info, which is typical but could be risky if the '_version.py' file is compromised. Overall, the code is safe and not malicious.",
