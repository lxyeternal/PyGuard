The primary concern is the use of exec() to read version info, which should be secured by ensuring the integrity of '_version.py'. No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily due to the exec() pattern, which is common but should be handled cautiously."

The existing reports correctly assess its safety, and the scores are appropriate. A risk score of approximately 0.1 reflects the minimal security concern due to network interactions, but overall, the code poses no significant threat."
