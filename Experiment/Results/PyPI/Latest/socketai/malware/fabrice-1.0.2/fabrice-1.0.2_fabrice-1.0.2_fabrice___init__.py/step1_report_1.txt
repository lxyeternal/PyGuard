  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns detected. All imports are from local modules; no dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, which are typical for a Python package setup. No external input handling, data leaks, or malicious code execution pathways are evident. The structure suggests standard module imports for package functionality without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
