  "purpose": "Import statements for a Python package, establishing namespace and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: ._version, .connection, .runners, .group, .tasks, .executor.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not execute untrusted data or perform system actions.",
  "flows": "N/A – only static imports, no runtime data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or dynamic code execution. Import statements are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, establishing the package's API surface. There are no signs of code execution, data handling, or malicious behavior. The absence of runtime logic, user input handling, network operations, or code execution suggests a benign structure. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be standard package import setup with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply exposes components for external use. Overall security risk is minimal.",
