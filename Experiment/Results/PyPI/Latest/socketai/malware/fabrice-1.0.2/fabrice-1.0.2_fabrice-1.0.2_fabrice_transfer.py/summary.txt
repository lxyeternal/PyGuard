  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented file transfer utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified, and the risk score around 0.2 appropriately reflects potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but no active vulnerabilities are evident."
