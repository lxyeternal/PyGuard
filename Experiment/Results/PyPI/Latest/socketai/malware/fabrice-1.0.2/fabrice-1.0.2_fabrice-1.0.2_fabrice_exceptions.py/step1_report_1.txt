{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions within a Python application, likely related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or external data interactions in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists; the code is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists of straightforward exception class definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. These are used for error handling and do not contain any executable logic or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. The comments indicate potential future refactoring or code organization notes but do not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of custom exception class definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical application code for error handling.",
