  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions in a Python application, possibly related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No input sources or external data reads; only class definitions and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output actions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely class and exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with descriptive docstrings and minimal implementation. The classes are intended for error handling related to task grouping and environment validation. There are no functions executing external commands, network activity, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present. The code appears to be standard practice for custom exception handling in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains benign exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is part of standard application error handling. No security risks are identified.",
