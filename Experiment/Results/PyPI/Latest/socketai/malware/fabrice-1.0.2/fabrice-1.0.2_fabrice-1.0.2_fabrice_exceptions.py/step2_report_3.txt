  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely defining custom exception classes with no executable logic, external data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- No external input, data sinks, or data flows are present.\n- The comments suggest potential future refactoring but do not impact current security posture.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are detected in any report.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent and appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis that the code is harmless.\n\n**Potential issues or reasoning flaws:**\n- The code is straightforward, and the analysis correctly identifies it as benign.\n- The purpose of the classes (error handling) is standard, and no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the code itself.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- The assigned scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n- Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions, higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The code is entirely benign, with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code is standard application code for defining custom exceptions, with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports correctly reflect this.",
