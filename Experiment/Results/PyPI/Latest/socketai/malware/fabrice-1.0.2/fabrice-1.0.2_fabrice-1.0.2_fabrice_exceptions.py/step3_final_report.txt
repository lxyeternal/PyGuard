  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and comments within the code; no external data sources or input handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; classes are used for exception raising and catching within the application.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three exception class definitions with no executable logic, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. It is standard Python code for error management, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The comments indicate potential future refactoring but do not impact current security posture. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as standard exception class definitions with no security implications. The scores assigned are accurate, and no further action or concern is necessary.",
