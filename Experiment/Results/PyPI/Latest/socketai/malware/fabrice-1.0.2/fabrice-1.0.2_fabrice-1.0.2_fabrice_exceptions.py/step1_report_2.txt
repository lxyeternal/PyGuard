{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in a Python project, likely related to task execution or error handling.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or data; it only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks occur within this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks; the classes are used for exception handling only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present; the code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. All are simple subclasses of Exception with no additional logic, attributes, or external dependencies. No input reading, data processing, or external communication is involved. The classes appear to be used for specific error signaling within a larger application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. The code is minimal, clean, and standard for exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of straightforward exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle untrusted data or perform any potentially dangerous operations.",
