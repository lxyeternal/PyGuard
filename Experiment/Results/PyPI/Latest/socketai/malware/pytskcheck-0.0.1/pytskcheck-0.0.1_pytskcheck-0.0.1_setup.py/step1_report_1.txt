{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the Python package 'pytskcheck'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata (name, version, author, description, packages) from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only contains static setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setuptools' library and calls 'setup' with static metadata. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. The code is a straightforward package setup script without any suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic execution. It does not include network activity, data theft, or backdoor mechanisms. The structure is typical for Python packaging and contains no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
