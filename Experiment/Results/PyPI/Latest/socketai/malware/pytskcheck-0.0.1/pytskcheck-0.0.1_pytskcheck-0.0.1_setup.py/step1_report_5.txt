  "purpose": "Setuptools setup script for packaging the 'pytskcheck' Python module.",
  "sources": "The script reads package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and packages list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present; no data leaks or external effects identified.",
  "flows": "Metadata variables are used directly in the setup function; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The script is a standard setup configuration with minimal information.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward use of setuptools to define package metadata. It includes only static data without any input/output operations, dynamic code execution, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. The description field contains 'None', which might be considered incomplete, but not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration file with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
