  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static string, likely used for testing or placeholder purposes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or environment variables read.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could leak information or cause effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; function returns a constant string directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with a static return value, exhibiting no dynamic behavior, no external dependencies, and no security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with consistent scores indicating no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The code's simplicity and clarity support high confidence in its safety. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as safe. No further action or revision is necessary.",
