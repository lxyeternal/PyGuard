{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer that imports 'test_function' from 'module1' and exposes it via '__all__' for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a local module 'module1' and accesses 'test_function'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing 'test_function' from 'module1' during module initialization; no external data flows or network activity occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is a straightforward Python package __init__.py file with standard structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard Python package initializer that imports a function from a local module and exposes it. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a confidence of 1 and scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these assessments. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected, and the code aligns with best practices for package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent, and the scores are appropriate given the code's straightforward nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
