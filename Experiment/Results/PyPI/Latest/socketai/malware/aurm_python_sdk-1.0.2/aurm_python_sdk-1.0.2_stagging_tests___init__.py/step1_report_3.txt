  "flows": "Imported 'test_function' could potentially be invoked elsewhere, but within this code, there is no flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code constructs; straightforward package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a single function from a local module and defines '__all__' for exports. No code execution, data handling, or external data sources are present. There is no obfuscation, no dynamic code, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign package initialization file with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
