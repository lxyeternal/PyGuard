  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks observed",
  "flows": "Import from module1, potentially making test_function available externally",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function named test_function from a local module and exposes it via __all__. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution. The code is standard for setting up a test package and contains no indicators of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical __init__.py setup for a testing package, with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
