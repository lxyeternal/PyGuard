  "flows": "Import statement leading to the availability of test_function for use in testing code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer that imports a function from a sibling module and exposes it via __all__. No external data input, no network calls, no credential handling, and no suspicious or obfuscated code. The structure is standard for Python packages, and there are no signs of malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign package initializer with no malicious or security-related issues.",
