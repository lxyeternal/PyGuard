  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple `__init__.py` file that imports `test_function` from `module1` and exposes it via `__all__`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data flows, external network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores all at 0.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: it imports `test_function` from `.module1` and defines `__all__`.\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, such as code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or data leaks.\n- The purpose and analysis in each report are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- Since all reports agree and the code is trivial, there are no logical flaws or reasoning errors.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all assessments are conservative and accurate.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- No score adjustments needed.\n- The reports are consistent, and their conclusions are justified.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores reflect the actual content accurately.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard package initializer with no security concerns. No further action or scoring adjustments are necessary.",
