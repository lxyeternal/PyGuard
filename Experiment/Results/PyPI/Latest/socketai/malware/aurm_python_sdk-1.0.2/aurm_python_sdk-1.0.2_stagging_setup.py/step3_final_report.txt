{
  "purpose": "The code downloads remote content from a specified URL, writes it to a local file, and appends a command to execute this file in user shell configuration files, creating persistent execution without validation.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen() fetching remote URL; open() writing to ~/.fleetwood.py; open() appending to ~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'python ~/.fleetwood.py' during shell startup; remote code execution potential",
  "flows": "Remote URL content fetched -> written to ~/.fleetwood.py -> command 'python ~/.fleetwood.py' appended to shell configs -> executed at shell startup",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling; no validation or signature verification of remote content; hardcoded URL; modification of user environment files without user consent",
  "analysis": "The script fetches external code without validation, writes it locally, and sets up automatic execution via shell configuration files. Silent error handling masks failures, increasing risk. The behavior resembles malicious persistence mechanisms or backdoors, enabling remote code execution and data compromise. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but highly suspicious due to its actions. Scores assigned in reports (malware 0.75-0.9, risk 0.75-0.9) are justified; however, given the severity, a malware score of 0.9 and risk of 1.0 are warranted.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code without validation, modifying user environment files for persistence, and masking errors. It should be considered highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
