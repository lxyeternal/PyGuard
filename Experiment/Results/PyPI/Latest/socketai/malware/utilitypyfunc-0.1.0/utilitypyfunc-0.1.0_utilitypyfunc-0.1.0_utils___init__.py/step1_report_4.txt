  "purpose": "Importing a module named utils, likely for utility functions.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'utils' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows or output functions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed; the code only contains an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of additional code makes it difficult to identify anomalies. Importing 'utils' alone is common but warrants further context.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for a module named 'utils'. Without further code, there are no evident sources, sinks, or flows. The import itself is typical in Python projects. No suspicious or malicious behavior can be inferred from this single line. Given the absence of additional context, there are no obvious security concerns, malicious intent, or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting only of an import statement with no evidence of malicious activity. Additional code would be necessary to evaluate further.",
