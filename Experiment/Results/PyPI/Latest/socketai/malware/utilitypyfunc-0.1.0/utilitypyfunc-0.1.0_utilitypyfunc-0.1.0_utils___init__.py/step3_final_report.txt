{
  "purpose": "To assess whether the import statement 'import utils' contains malicious behavior or security risks in the context of supply chain security.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statement itself; no other sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows; the code only imports a module without further data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement 'import utils', which is benign in isolation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The reports correctly identify the lack of context and the benign nature of such an import. Malware scores are appropriately zero, and risk scores are minimal, reflecting the low likelihood of malicious intent. The only potential concern is the content of the 'utils' package, which cannot be assessed here; thus, further review of that package is recommended if source trustworthiness is uncertain. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are consistent with the minimal, benign code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement 'import utils' is benign and poses no security threat based on the provided code. The reports are accurate, and the current low malware and risk scores are appropriate. Further review of the 'utils' package source is advisable if there are concerns about its trustworthiness, but the code itself does not indicate malicious intent.",
