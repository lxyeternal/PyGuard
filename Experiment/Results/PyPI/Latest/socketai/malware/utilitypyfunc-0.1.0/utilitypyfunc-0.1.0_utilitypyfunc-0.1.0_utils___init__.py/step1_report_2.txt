{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'utils', which suggests usage of utility functions or helpers.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is a source, but does not read external input or data directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in the provided code snippet; no data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable since the code only contains an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; import alone is not suspicious but offers no context. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for a module named 'utils'. Without additional context or code, it is not possible to determine malicious intent or risky behavior. The module could be benign or malicious, but no suspicious behavior is evident from this single line.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The import statement alone is standard and does not indicate any compromise.",
