  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code snippet and the reasoning within each report.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports focus solely on a single import statement: `import utils`.\n- None of the reports present evidence of actual malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or anomalies beyond the minimal code.\n- The confidence levels vary from 0.2 to 0.8, reflecting different degrees of certainty about potential risks.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risks are minimal or zero, given the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Presence\n- The code snippet is confirmed to contain only `import utils`.\n- No other code, data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or anomalies are evident.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports\n- The reports correctly note that a single import statement is benign in isolation.\n- Some reports suggest further review of the 'utils' package, which is prudent, but they do not claim maliciousness without evidence.\n- No report incorrectly infers malicious activity based solely on the import statement.\n\n### Scores and Justifications\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- **Malware:** All assign 0, consistent with the evidence.\n- **Security Risk:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n### Potential Issues\n- The reports with lower confidence (e.g., 0.2, 0.5) appropriately recognize the limitations of analyzing only an import statement.\n- The report with confidence 0.8 (Report 1) might overstate certainty; however, it correctly concludes that the code appears benign.\n\n### Recommendations\n- Since no actual malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is present, the risk scores should remain low.\n- A higher malware score is unwarranted unless additional context suggests malicious intent.\n- The security risk score could be slightly increased if there's concern about the 'utils' package source, but without further info, keeping it minimal is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n**Based on the provided code and reports, my estimated scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear and minimal.\n- **Risk (security risk):** **0.1** — Slightly elevated if considering supply chain concerns, but minimal in this context.\n\n**Summary:** The code snippet is benign, and the reports are appropriately cautious. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present, and the overall security risk remains very low.",
