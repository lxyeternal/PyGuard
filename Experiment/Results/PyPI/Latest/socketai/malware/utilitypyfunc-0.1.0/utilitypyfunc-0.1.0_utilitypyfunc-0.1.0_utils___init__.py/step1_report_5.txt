  "purpose": "Importing a module named 'utils', likely for utility functions or common operations.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import utils' indicates the code reads the 'utils' module; no other input or data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands are present in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is identifiable within this single import statement; further code needed to determine data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single import statement; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior can be observed from this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'utils', which is common for utility functions. Without additional code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The snippet is too minimal to analyze for embedded malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no indications of malicious activity or security risks. The code appears benign, but a more complete context would be necessary for thorough analysis.",
