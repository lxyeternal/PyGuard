  "purpose": "Importing the utils module, likely for utility functions or operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing the 'utils' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are evident in this single line.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of further code limits analysis; the import itself is benign but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement. Without additional code, it's impossible to determine if 'utils' contains malicious code or if the import is part of a malicious supply chain. The presence of an import alone is common and not suspicious, but it warrants further review of the 'utils' package if available.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign as it only imports a module without any malicious activity evident. Further review of the 'utils' package is recommended if the package source or contents are suspicious.",
