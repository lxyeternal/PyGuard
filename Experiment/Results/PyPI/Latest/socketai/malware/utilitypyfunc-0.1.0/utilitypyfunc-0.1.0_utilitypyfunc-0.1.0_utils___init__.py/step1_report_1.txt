  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'utils', which suggests it might be used to provide utility functions for a larger application or script.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is not a data source; it only loads a module. No other input or data reading occurs in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows in the provided snippet, as it only contains an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not exhibit unusual patterns, obfuscation, or hard-coded secrets. The 'utils' module name is generic and does not indicate malicious intent by itself.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a module named 'utils'. Without further context or additional code, there are no apparent security risks, malicious behaviors, or anomalies. The import alone does not imply malicious activity; it is standard practice in Python programming.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the single import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. The code appears benign and standard.",
