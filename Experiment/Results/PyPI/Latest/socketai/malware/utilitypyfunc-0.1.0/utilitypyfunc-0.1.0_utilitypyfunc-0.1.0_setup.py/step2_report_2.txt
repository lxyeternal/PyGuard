  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard, benign setup.py script for a Python package named 'utilitypyfunc'.\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code, no input processing, no network activity, and no obfuscation.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis that there's no evident security concern.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code's purpose is purely to define package metadata and dependencies.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform network communication, or execute dynamic code.\n\n**Assessment of Scores:**\n- All reports give a confidence of 1, which is justified given the consistent, clear, and standard nature of the code.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Potential issues or considerations:**\n- The author email is publicly visible, but that is standard and not malicious.\n- No signs of backdoors, code injection, or malicious dependencies.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and should remain as they are.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the actual code content.\n\n**Final note:**\nThe code is a textbook example of a safe, standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library. No further action is necessary.",
