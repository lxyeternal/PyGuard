  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library named 'utilitypyfunc'.",
  "sources": "Package metadata definitions, such as name, version, author, and dependencies (requests).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies without dynamic code, input handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the static and standard nature of the code. No errors or flaws are present in the reports' reasoning. The author email is publicly visible but not malicious. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No further action is necessary.",
