  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'utilitypyfunc' including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Constants and configuration data within the setup() function (package name, version, dependencies, author info, description, classifiers, python requirements).",
  "sinks": "N/A; the code does not process untrusted data or include executable logic that would lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is static configuration data without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code appears to be a standard setup script with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools and defines a setup() call with package metadata and requirements. No dynamic execution, input handling, or code injection mechanisms are present. The dependencies and metadata are typical for a Python package, and there are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. The email and author details are publicly visible but not malicious. Overall, it is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
