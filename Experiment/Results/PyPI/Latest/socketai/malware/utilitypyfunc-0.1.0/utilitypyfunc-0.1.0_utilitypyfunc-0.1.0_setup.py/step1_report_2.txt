{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'utilitypyfunc' intended for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'setuptools' library import statements and the setup() function parameters such as package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The code writes package metadata and dependencies but does not perform any data output or network communication itself.",
  "flows": "Input sources include the import statements and setup() parameters; data flows into the setup() function, which processes package configuration. There are no flows involving untrusted data leading to data leaks or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with package metadata including name, version, packages, dependencies, author info, description, classifiers, and python version requirement. All components follow typical packaging conventions. No untrusted input handling, network calls, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and intended solely for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain obfuscated/malicious code. The risk score is minimal, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
