  "purpose": "Defines a Python package setup configuration for 'utilitypyfunc', specifying package details, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Static code, especially the setup() function call and its arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data processing; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code is a static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the setup script is straightforward and follows standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python library. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and compatibility. There are no signs of malicious code, such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or network activity. All elements are typical for a package setup script, with no suspicious behavior or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be a benign, standard configuration for distributing a Python package.",
