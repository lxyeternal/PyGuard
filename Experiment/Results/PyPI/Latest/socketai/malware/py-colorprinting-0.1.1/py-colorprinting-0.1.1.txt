      "conclusion": "The core code is safe and straightforward, with no malicious behavior detected. The only concern is the external 'test' module's InitializeConsole() function, which could be malicious if compromised. Assigning a malware score of 0 and an obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk score should be set at approximately 0.2 to reflect the dependency risk. Continuous validation of external dependencies is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to its pattern of downloading and executing external code without validation, typical of malware loaders or supply chain attacks. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; I would elevate the malware score to 0.9 and the overall security risk to 0.9, reflecting the serious threat level."
