  "purpose": "Package initialization to expose the ColorPrint class from the core module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "Importing ColorPrint from local module without data flow or external interaction",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import statement, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file that imports a class from a local module. It contains no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The import is straightforward, typical for Python packages, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code, with no anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate a safe, standard import statement, and the scores reflect this assessment.",
