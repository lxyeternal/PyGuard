  "purpose": "The code initializes the colorprint package by importing the ColorPrint class from the core module.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .core import ColorPrint",
  "sinks": "None, as the code does not handle untrusted data or user input",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs an import",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "This file is a simple module initializer that imports a class. It does not contain any executable logic, data processing, or potential entry points for malicious activity. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present in this small snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely responsible for module setup by importing a class. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
