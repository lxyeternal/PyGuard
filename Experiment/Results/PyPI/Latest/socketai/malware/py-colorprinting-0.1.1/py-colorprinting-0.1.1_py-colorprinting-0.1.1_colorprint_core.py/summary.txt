  "conclusion": "The core code is safe and straightforward, with no malicious behavior detected. The only concern is the external 'test' module's InitializeConsole() function, which could be malicious if compromised. Assigning a malware score of 0 and an obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk score should be set at approximately 0.2 to reflect the dependency risk. Continuous validation of external dependencies is recommended."
