  "purpose": "A simple console coloring utility that initializes console settings via an external module.",
  "sources": "Import from 'test' module and call to InitializeConsole()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output effects detected within this code snippet",
  "flows": "External InitializeConsole() call upon startup; no internal data flows or untrusted data processing",
  "anomalies": "External dependency 'test' and its function 'InitializeConsole()' could perform arbitrary or malicious actions; code itself is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign utility for colored console output with ANSI escape codes. The only external element is the call to InitializeConsole() from the 'test' module, which could be malicious if the module is compromised. The code contains no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns. The malware score is 0, as no malicious code is present within this snippet. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score should account for the external dependency; given the potential for malicious behavior if the module is untrusted, a moderate risk score of 0.2 is justified. Overall, the code is safe, but reliance on external modules warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The core code is safe and straightforward, with no malicious behavior detected. The only concern is the external 'test' module's InitializeConsole() function, which could be malicious if compromised. Assigning a malware score of 0 and an obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk score should be set at approximately 0.2 to reflect the dependency risk. Continuous validation of external dependencies is recommended.",
