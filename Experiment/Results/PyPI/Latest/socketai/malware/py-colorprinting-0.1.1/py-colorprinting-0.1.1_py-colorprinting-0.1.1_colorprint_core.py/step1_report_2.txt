{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a console environment and provides a utility class for printing colored text to the terminal.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'test' module via 'InitializeConsole()'. No other input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to the console using print(). No untrusted data is directed elsewhere or transmitted over a network.",
  "flows": "Input from 'InitializeConsole()' may influence subsequent execution, but the code shown only prints static or color-based output. No flow of untrusted data to sensitive sinks is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic. The color dictionary is standard for terminal coloring.",
  "analysis": "The script imports and invokes a function from an external 'test' module, which may initialize console or environment settings. The 'ColorPrint' class provides a static method to print colored text, which is a common utility. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for colored terminal output.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs initialization and provides a safe utility for colored printing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
