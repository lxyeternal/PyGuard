  "purpose": "Define a class for colored console output and initialize console settings.",
  "sources": "Import statement for InitializeConsole from test module",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external outputs that could cause data leaks or security issues",
  "flows": "Initialization function call (InitializeConsole) at the start; class methods use static data for coloring output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function InitializeConsole from an external module named test and calls it, which might perform console setup. It then defines a ColorPrint class with a static dictionary of ANSI color codes for colored output. The print method outputs text in specified color if recognized; otherwise, it prints normally. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or insecure practices. The code appears to be straightforward and intended solely for formatted output.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on colored console output with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
