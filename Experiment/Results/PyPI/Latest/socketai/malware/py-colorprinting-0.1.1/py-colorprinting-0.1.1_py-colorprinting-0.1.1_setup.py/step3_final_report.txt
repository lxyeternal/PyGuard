  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, importing setuptools, defining package info and requirements.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code, no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, specifies package metadata, reads the long description from 'README.md' without error handling, and lists dependencies. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or untrusted input processing. All reports correctly identify the code as benign with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of open() without error handling is standard in such scripts and does not indicate malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
