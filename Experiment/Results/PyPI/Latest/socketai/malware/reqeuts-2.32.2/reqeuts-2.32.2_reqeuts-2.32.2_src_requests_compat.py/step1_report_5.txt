{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and sets up necessary imports for HTTP, encoding, and version compatibility.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module for character detection libraries ('chardet', 'charset_normalizer'), sys.version_info for Python version, import statements for json/simplejson, collections, http.cookies, io.StringIO, urllib.parse, urllib.request, builtins (str, bytes), and type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs are explicitly handled or processed in a way that could lead to data leaks or injection. No user input or untrusted source is read or written without validation or sanitization.",
  "flows": "N/A, there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up imports and compatibility layers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward, primarily for compatibility purposes, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes compatibility layers for different Python versions and third-party libraries, importing modules for HTTP, JSON, character detection, and URL handling. It detects the Python version, chooses appropriate modules, and assigns variables for later use. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or data processing that could be malicious. The code appears standard for a compatibility module without any suspicious logic or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical compatibility setup module that manages imports and version differences. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, with no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
