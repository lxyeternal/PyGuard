{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling different Python versions and external library support, mainly for the urllib3 package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from version strings ('urllib3.__version__'), import statements, and system version information ('sys.version_info').",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code primarily performs imports and version checks without processing external input data in a vulnerable way.",
  "flows": "The code reads version info and attempts to import modules; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials or dynamic code execution. The import resolution logic is standard for compatibility and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages compatibility across Python versions and dependencies such as urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, and simplejson. It performs version detection, dynamic module imports, and conditional imports based on availability. All operations are static, and no untrusted data is processed or manipulated. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility and import utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply ensures compatibility and proper module imports for the larger package context.",
