  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility support for different Python versions and handles imports for HTTP, URL, and character detection libraries.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module (dynamically imports chardet or charset_normalizer), sys.version_info, urllib3.__version__, and various standard library imports.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or actions are evident.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious intent, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages compatibility and import resolution across different Python versions and third-party libraries. It includes dynamic imports for character detection libraries, version checks, and fallback mechanisms for JSON parsing. All operations are standard and benign, with no indications of malicious behavior or data leakage. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility module with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs typical import resolution and version checks without any suspicious or malicious logic.",
