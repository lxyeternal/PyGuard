  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a compatibility utility module that handles imports, version detection, and optional dependencies.\n- No report mentions any untrusted input, network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n- The code relies on standard patterns: try-except for optional modules, version checks, and straightforward imports.\n- The overall conclusion from all reports is that the code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- It only handles compatibility and optional imports.\n- No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks are present.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The code appears correct and standard for its purpose.\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The only minor point is that `basestring` is defined as `(str, bytes)` for compatibility, which is standard.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only manages imports and version detection without processing untrusted data or executing external code dynamically, the risk is negligible.\n- The code does not contain any backdoors, network activity, or credential handling.\n- The dynamic import pattern is standard for compatibility layers and not malicious.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- No discrepancies are apparent; the scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' conclusions that this code is a standard, benign compatibility utility module with no security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very minimal, just for safety, but practically negligible)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a well-structured, standard compatibility layer for Python 2/3 and dependency management. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is safe.",
