  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions are justified based on the code provided.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is a compatibility utility module, handling imports, version detection, and optional dependencies.\n- It performs dynamic imports with try-except blocks, version parsing, and assigns compatibility variables.\n- No user input, network activity, or data processing from untrusted sources is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are observed.\n- All operations are standard for maintaining compatibility across Python versions and dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard compatibility utility with no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is typical for such modules, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on compatibility for urllib3 and dependency imports; no untrusted data or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code performs version checks and optional imports, nothing suspicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 — justified.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Compatibility handling for Python versions and dependencies, no untrusted data or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. The code is a compatibility layer with no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, managing imports and compatibility, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 — justified.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Compatibility setup, no malicious behavior, no data leaks.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is straightforward and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate since the code performs benign compatibility functions.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-understood compatibility layer. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No changes are necessary.",
