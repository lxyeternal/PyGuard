{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility support for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and manages imports for various utility libraries used in HTTP requests and data handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information (`sys.version_info`), attempts to import optional libraries (`simplejson`, `chardet`, `charset_normalizer`), and imports standard modules (`importlib`, `sys`, `collections`, `http`, `io`, `urllib`).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or forward untrusted data to sensitive system functions or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "The code reads environment and version info, then conditionally imports libraries based on availability, with no data flowing from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard compatibility handling without any obfuscated or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a compatibility and import management module. It checks Python version and urllib3 version, then dynamically imports optional libraries such as chardet and simplejson. It also sets up compatibility aliases and version-dependent imports. No data is read from untrusted sources, nor is any data written or transmitted. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present, and all operations are standard for a compatibility layer. The code appears to be legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility layer for managing imports and environment differences across Python versions. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
