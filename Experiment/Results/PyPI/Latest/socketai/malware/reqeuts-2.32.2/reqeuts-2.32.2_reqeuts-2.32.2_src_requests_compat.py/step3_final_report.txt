{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility support for Python 2 and 3, manages optional dependencies, and handles import resolution for various modules used in the package.",
  "sources": "Version string from urllib3, import attempts for 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', sys.version_info, optional import of 'simplejson', standard library imports for collections, http, io, urllib, and http.request modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only performs internal version checks, dynamic imports, and variable assignments without processing external input.",
  "flows": "Version string parsed from urllib3 -> determines urllib3 major version -> dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' -> optional import of 'simplejson' -> fallback to 'json' -> setting compatibility variables and import aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, uses standard compatibility patterns, and does not perform any suspicious or obfuscated operations.",
  "analysis": "The code detects urllib3 version, dynamically imports optional character detection libraries, manages compatibility between Python 2 and 3, and sets up import aliases for JSON handling and other standard modules. It employs try-except blocks for safe optional imports and version parsing. No untrusted data is processed, network activity is absent, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code is a typical compatibility layer, with clear logic and safe practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. All signals indicate safe, well-understood operations, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
