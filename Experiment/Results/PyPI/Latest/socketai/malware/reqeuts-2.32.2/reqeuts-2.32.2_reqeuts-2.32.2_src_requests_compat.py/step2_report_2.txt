  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code performs version detection, optional module imports, and compatibility handling.\n- All reports consistently identify that the code uses standard, well-understood patterns.\n- No untrusted data sources, network activity, or user input processing is present.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The dynamic imports and version checks are typical for compatibility layers.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code appears correct and standard; no issues or vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - The dynamic import logic is safe, with try-except blocks properly used.\n   - No anomalies or signs of malicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code's purpose.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The overall security risk is also correctly scored as 0.\n   - The confidence level is 1, indicating certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely for compatibility, with no malicious or risky behavior, higher scores are unjustified.\n   - The current scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malicious activity, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present.\n   - The code does not perform network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated operations.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThis code is a standard compatibility utility module, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
