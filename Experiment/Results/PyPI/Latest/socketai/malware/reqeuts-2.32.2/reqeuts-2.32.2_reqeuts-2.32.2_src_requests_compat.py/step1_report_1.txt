{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility utilities and import handling for different Python versions and dependencies, primarily related to HTTP requests, character detection, and JSON parsing.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module(), sys.version_info, urllib3.__version__, built-in modules (json, simplejson), standard library modules (collections, http, io, urllib).",
  "sinks": "importlib.import_module(), dynamic import of chardet/charset_normalizer, usage of version information, standard library imports, and variable assignments.",
  "flows": "The code dynamically imports optional modules based on availability, detects library versions, and sets compatibility flags for Python 2/3, with no untrusted input feeding into sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs dynamic imports based on try-except blocks and version checks, but no suspicious behavior such as hidden network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily utility functions for compatibility, involving version detection, optional module import (chardet, simplejson), and setting compatibility variables. No external data input or user data is processed. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. All imports and function calls are standard and safe. The dynamic import pattern is typical for compatibility layers and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or suspicious logic is found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs version detection, optional module import, and compatibility settings safely. Overall security risk is negligible.",
