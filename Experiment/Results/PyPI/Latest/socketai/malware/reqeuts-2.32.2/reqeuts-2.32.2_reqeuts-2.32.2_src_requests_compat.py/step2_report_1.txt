  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a compatibility utility module, handling Python version differences, optional dependencies, and import resolution.\n- All reports agree that the code performs standard, benign operations: version detection, dynamic imports, fallback mechanisms.\n- No untrusted data is processed or transmitted.\n- No suspicious behaviors such as obfuscated code, network activity, credential handling, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The dynamic import patterns are typical for compatibility layers and do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious activity:** None of the reports identify any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports confirm the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently zero across all reports.\n- **Security risk:** Also zero, as the code does not process untrusted input or perform risky operations.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0. No evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, a risk score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-understood compatibility utility.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security risks detected.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The overall security posture of this code is very low risk. It’s a typical compatibility layer used in many projects to ensure cross-version support safely.",
