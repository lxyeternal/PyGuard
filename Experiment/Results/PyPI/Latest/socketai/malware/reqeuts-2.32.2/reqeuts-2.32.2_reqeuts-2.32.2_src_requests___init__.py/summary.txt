  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, routine dependency validation and environment configuration routine for an open-source HTTP library. It does not contain malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious elements. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores are zero. The overall assessment indicates a safe and standard implementation."
