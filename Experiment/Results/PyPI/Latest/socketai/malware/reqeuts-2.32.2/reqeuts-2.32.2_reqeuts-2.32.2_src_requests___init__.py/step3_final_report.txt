  "sources": "Version strings from imported modules (urllib3, chardet, charset_normalizer, cryptography), environment detection (ssl), and internal module imports.",
  "sinks": "Warnings and assertions for version validation; fallback injection of pyopenssl if SNI support is missing.",
  "flows": "Source version strings are checked via assertions; fallback modules are imported if needed; warnings are issued for incompatible versions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for version checks (which can be disabled), standard warnings, and fallback mechanisms; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment validation, dependency version checks, and SSL fallback setup routines. It uses assertions for critical version validation, which are common but can be disabled, though this does not imply malicious intent. Warnings are used appropriately for compatibility issues. No untrusted data handling, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code structure is clear, well-organized, and adheres to standard practices for dependency management and environment setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, routine dependency validation and environment configuration routine for an open-source HTTP library. It does not contain malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious elements. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores are zero. The overall assessment indicates a safe and standard implementation.",
