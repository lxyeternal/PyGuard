  "purpose": "Static package metadata declarations for the 'requests' Python library, including version, author, license, and descriptive information.",
  "sources": "None; the code consists solely of variable assignments defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, network operations, or external data handling are present.",
  "flows": "None; static assignment statements without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static set of variable assignments providing package metadata. No functions, control flow, network activity, or dynamic behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are appropriately set to 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious signals are detected. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static metadata declaration for the 'requests' package, posing no security threat or malicious behavior. The scores and assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
