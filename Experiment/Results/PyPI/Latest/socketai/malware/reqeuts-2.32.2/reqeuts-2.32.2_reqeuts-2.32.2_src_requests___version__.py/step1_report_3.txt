  "sources": "Constant assignments at the beginning of the file, including metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only initializes metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only straightforward variable assignments setting metadata attributes for the 'requests' package, such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and decorative emojis. There are no functions, external data inputs, or operations that could be malicious. The code appears to be part of a standard package metadata file with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign metadata declaration for the 'requests' package with no malicious or security risks detected.",
