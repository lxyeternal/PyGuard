  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static variable assignments for package metadata.\n- No dynamic code, network operations, data handling, or obfuscation is mentioned.\n- All reports conclude the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, and obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no suspicion of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is straightforward, consisting solely of static variable assignments.\n   - No evidence of malicious code, data flow, or suspicious patterns.\n   - Confirmed: **No issues present.**\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors detected.\n   - No suspicious patterns or anomalies are overlooked.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign risk scores higher than 0.5, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The code is just metadata, with no potential for harm.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n   - No malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All scores align well with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a simple, static metadata declaration for the 'requests' package.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is entirely benign, and no security concerns are present.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the current findings and confirms the code's safety.",
