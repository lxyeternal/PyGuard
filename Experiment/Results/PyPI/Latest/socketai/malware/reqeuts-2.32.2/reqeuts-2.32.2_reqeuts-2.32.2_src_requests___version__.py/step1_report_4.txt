  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments setting package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code consists solely of static variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard metadata definition with no unusual or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only string and numeric assignments to variables that describe package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, etc. There are no input/output operations, no code execution, and no embedded or obfuscated code. The comments are decorative ASCII art, not code logic. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward, benign metadata file for the 'requests' library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely contains package metadata information with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
