  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Read-only variable assignments; no external input sources.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data is used or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only package metadata variables such as __title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, and __cake__. These are static assignments with no input handling, control flow, or external data processing. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or backdoors. The content is consistent with standard Python package metadata and includes no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely provides metadata about the 'requests' library without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign and standard package info definition.",
