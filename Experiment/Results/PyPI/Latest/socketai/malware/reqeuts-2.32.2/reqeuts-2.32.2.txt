      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical, legitimate setup script with minimal security concerns. The main potential risk stems from the use of exec() to load version info, which could be exploited if the version file is compromised. The os.system() calls are standard for publishing but should be used cautiously. No evidence of malicious activity or malware is present. The scoring in the reports is appropriate, with no need for adjustments."

The only technical flaw is the incorrect 'copy()' method, which does not pose security concerns. The overall assessment and scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the security risk score is minimal. No further action is necessary."
