  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies the code as utility functions/classes for cookie handling, with standard imports and data access patterns.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Describes typical cookie extraction, creation, and management flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or network activity. The code appears standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; no malicious elements.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1  \n**Justification:** The low security risk is appropriate; the code is standard utility code with minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with accurate description.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard cookie management.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; safe utility code.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0  \n**Justification:** No security concerns; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as cookie utilities, compatible with requests and urllib3.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious activity or obfuscation; standard implementation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0  \n**Justification:** The code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description of cookie handling functions and classes.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity; standard functions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2  \n**Justification:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) might be due to the functions that modify headers or cookies, but these are standard operations. No actual malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes cookie management routines.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid.\n\n**Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2  \n**Justification:** Same reasoning as Report 4; standard cookie handling with low risk.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's functionality. The code is purely utility-based, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign very low scores (0 or 0.2). Given the code's nature, a risk score above 0.2 would be unjustified unless there were hidden or malicious logic, which there isn't.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, standard implementation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Slightly above zero due to the potential misuse of cookie manipulation functions, but overall very low risk.\n\n**My estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code is a standard, well-implemented cookie utility module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.",
