  "sources": "Functions accessing request headers, response headers, and cookie attributes; cookie creation and extraction routines.",
  "sinks": "Cookie header generation, cookie storage/modification, and header updates in request/response cycles.",
  "flows": "Request object headers -> cookie extraction/creation functions -> cookie jar modifications -> header generation for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or network activity; standard cookie handling code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard cookie management utilities, including wrappers for request/response objects, cookie extraction, creation, deletion, and merging. It operates solely on cookie data, with no network activity or obfuscation. The functions are straightforward, using common libraries and patterns. No malicious code, backdoors, or covert channels are present. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard cookie utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk scores are appropriate given its purpose. No further action is necessary.",
