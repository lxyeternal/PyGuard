  "purpose": "Provide compatibility utilities for managing cookies in the requests library, including cookie extraction, header management, and cookie jar operations.",
  "sources": "Functions that read data include request headers (e.g., get_header, get_new_headers), cookie extraction from responses, and cookie jar operations. Data input occurs via function arguments such as request objects, response objects, and cookie parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data is written or sent when adding headers (add_unredirected_header), setting cookies (set, set_cookie), or updating cookie jars. Sensitive data could be stored or transmitted through cookie values or headers.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from request headers or response headers flows into cookie extraction or cookie jar modification functions, which then set or update cookies in internal structures. Cookie setting functions update internal storage; cookie retrieval functions produce headers or cookie values for outgoing requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code largely consists of standard cookie handling routines with appropriate use of threading locks and serialization support. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie management utilities, including wrapping request and response objects, extracting cookies into a jar, creating and converting cookies, and managing cookie data structures. Functions are designed to support cookie handling within the requests library, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The functions handle data input and output safely, with no operations that suggest data exfiltration, code injection, or reverse shell activity. The use of threading locks and pickling support is consistent with standard practices. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected operations related to cookies and request handling without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
