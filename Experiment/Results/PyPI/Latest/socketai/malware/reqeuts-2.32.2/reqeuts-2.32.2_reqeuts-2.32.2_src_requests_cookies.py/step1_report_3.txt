  "purpose": "Provide compatibility utilities for managing cookies in the requests library, including classes and functions for cookie handling, extraction, and manipulation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules (calendar, copy, time, threading), and methods that access request and response headers, cookie data, and request URL properties.",
  "sinks": "Functions that process cookies, such as extract_cookies_to_jar, get_cookie_header, remove_cookie_by_name, and methods that modify or access cookie data, including set, __setitem__, and update.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as request headers, response headers, and cookie dictionaries into internal cookie objects, which are then stored, manipulated, and retrieved via various methods, potentially including network or storage operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code mainly performs standard cookie handling tasks, with exception raising for unexpected arguments. No suspicious network activity, hidden behaviors, or privacy violations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a cookie management system compatible with requests and urllib3, including classes for mock requests/responses and a cookie jar with dict-like interface. It processes cookies, supports extraction from responses, and allows cookie creation and merging. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or covert channels. Functions and classes perform standard, transparent operations related to cookie handling. The presence of exception handling and use of standard libraries indicates typical implementation rather than obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of cookie handling utilities for requests. It does not contain malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code’s purpose is to manage cookies safely and compatibly, with no evident security risks or malware. Overall, it is safe and aligns with normal functionality expected in cookie management modules.",
