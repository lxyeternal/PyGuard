  "purpose": "Maintain backwards compatibility by aliasing modules ('urllib3', 'idna', and optionally 'chardet') under 'requests.packages' namespace to ensure legacy code functions correctly.",
  "sources": "Imports modules ('urllib3', 'idna', 'chardet') and iterates over sys.modules to modify or create aliases.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.modules entries; no direct data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Imports modules, then assigns sys.modules entries to create aliases under 'requests.packages.*'.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic manipulation of sys.modules for namespace aliasing; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and reassigns their sys.modules entries to maintain compatibility with older code expecting modules in 'requests.packages'. This involves dynamic import and sys.modules manipulation, which can be risky if malicious modules are present but is a known pattern for legacy support. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The manipulation could be exploited in compromised environments, but the code itself is benign. The malware score is correctly zero; the obfuscated score is zero as the code is straightforward; the security risk score is low (around 0.2-0.4), reflecting potential misuse in untrusted environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a compatibility shim with no malicious intent. Its manipulation of sys.modules could be exploited if environment is compromised, but there is no active malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; I recommend maintaining malware=0, obfuscated=0, and setting security risk around 0.2 to 0.3.",
