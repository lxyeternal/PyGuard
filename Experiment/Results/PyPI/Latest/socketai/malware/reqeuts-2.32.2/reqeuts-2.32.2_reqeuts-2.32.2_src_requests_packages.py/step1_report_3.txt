  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by aliasing certain third-party modules within the requests package namespace.",
  "sources": "Modules imported via __import__ and existing in sys.modules, especially 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet'.",
  "sinks": "Modifications to sys.modules to alias modules under 'requests.packages.*'.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are assigned to sys.modules entries under the 'requests.packages.*' namespace to preserve identity and compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic module aliasing and manipulation of sys.modules, which can be risky if misused or manipulated maliciously. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code, but the code dynamically alters module imports at runtime.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'urllib3', 'idna', and conditionally 'chardet'. It then modifies sys.modules to alias these modules under the 'requests.packages.*' namespace to ensure compatibility with legacy code expecting these modules in that namespace. This is achieved via dynamic import (__import__), iteration over sys.modules, and assigning module references. The purpose is explicitly for backward compatibility, not malicious intent. No network activity, data leaks, or suspicious backdoors are present. The code is dynamic but consistent with typical compatibility practices; no malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely manipulates module imports to maintain backward compatibility within the Python environment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It’s a standard pattern for legacy support, with some dynamic module aliasing. Overall security risk is low.",
