{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling various error conditions in the Requests library, facilitating error management during HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Class initializers and attribute assignments within exception constructors, handling response and request objects.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; exception classes store references but do not process or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation with response/request objects; no data flow leading to vulnerabilities or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class definitions with standard inheritance and no dynamic or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a hierarchy of exception classes for the Requests library, with proper inheritance and handling of response/request attributes. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The __reduce__ method in JSONDecodeError is used for pickling, which is standard and safe. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The minimal security concern arises from the potential for exceptions to involve untrusted data, but the code itself does not process such data maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of exception classes for error handling in HTTP requests. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
