  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes for handling errors in the Requests library. No external data, no data leaks, no anomalies.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard class definitions, inheritance from built-in exceptions, no suspicious code.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard error handling code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, defining exception classes with proper inheritance and init methods. No malicious behavior.  \n- **Analysis:** Straightforward class hierarchy, no dynamic code or external interactions.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, typical exception definitions.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above, no suspicious patterns, standard exception classes.  \n- **Analysis:** Clear, standard structure, no obfuscation or malicious intent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Exception classes with some mention of data flow from network responses, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis:** Slightly more detailed, but still standard class definitions. No dynamic code, no data leaks, no obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 — the small risk score might be slightly overcautious, but given the lack of actual vulnerabilities, it's acceptable.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as others, no external input processing, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard exception class definitions, no anomalies.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard error handling code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is purely class definitions for exceptions, with no dynamic execution, no data processing, and no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the code content.\n- **Security Risk:** Zero or negligible, as the code does not handle untrusted data or perform network operations.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risks evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate, and I agree with the assessments provided.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the code is safe and typical for its purpose.",
