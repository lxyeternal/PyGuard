{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes used in the requests library for handling various HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or data; it primarily defines exception classes and imports.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or where untrusted input could cause security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is purely class definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code structure follows standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python exception class patterns. It imports exceptions, defines custom exception subclasses, and adds some documentation. No code injection, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior is evident. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or potentially malicious code is present. The inheritance and class structures are standard, with no obfuscated or dynamic code execution. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for error handling within the requests library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for the requests library with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is unlikely to pose any security threat based on the provided content.",
