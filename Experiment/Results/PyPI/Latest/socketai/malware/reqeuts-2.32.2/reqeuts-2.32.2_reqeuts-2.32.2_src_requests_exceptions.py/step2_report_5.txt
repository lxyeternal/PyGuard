  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes for handling errors in the Requests library. No external data, no data leaks, no anomalies.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard class definitions, inheritance, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues detected.  \n\n**Verdict:** The scoring aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; exception classes, no data processing, no anomalies.  \n- **Analysis:** Straightforward class hierarchy, no dynamic code or malicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.  \n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes, no data input or external data sources, no anomalies.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard exception class definitions, no suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code content.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with some mention of potential data flows and untrusted data, but ultimately finds no malicious behavior.  \n- **Analysis:** The mention of data flowing from network responses to exception objects is standard; no untrusted data processing occurs. The code is typical exception class definitions, with proper handling of pickling in JSONDecodeError.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.  \n- **Justification for scores:**  \n  - The securityRisk score of 0.2 seems slightly elevated given the benign code, but perhaps reflects cautious recognition that exceptions can sometimes be involved in data leaks if misused.  \n  - The malware score remains at 0, which is correct.  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly conservative but acceptable. The code itself does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; no external input, no malicious code, standard exception definitions.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a set of exception class definitions for the Requests library.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, matching the benign code.  \n- **Security Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero in one report (0.2), but given the nature of exception handling, this is a cautious but reasonable assessment.  \n- **Confidence Levels:** Appropriately high; the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n**Security Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, primarily due to the general nature of exception handling, which could be misused if combined with other malicious code, but not in this isolated context.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
