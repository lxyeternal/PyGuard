  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the scoring rationale, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of exception classes for the Requests library.\n- No external data sources or inputs are processed in the code.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions and other exceptions, with appropriate initializers and docstrings.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code segments are detected.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or untrusted data processing beyond exception definitions.\n- The overall structure and purpose are clear: to facilitate error handling in a network request context.\n\n**Scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk:**\n\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of class definitions.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.2), which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Critical assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard exception hierarchy, essential for robust error handling but not involving any complex logic or external interactions.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are justified here.\n- The minimal security risk scores (e.g., 0.2 in report 4) seem to be conservative and acceptable, given the context.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- No issues detected; the scores are reasonable.\n- The detailed explanations justify the low risk scores.\n- The only minor point is that in report 4, a slightly higher security risk score (0.2) is given, possibly due to the mention of exception attributes involving response/request objects. However, since these are just class attributes and not processed or executed, the risk remains minimal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is benign, standard, and does not pose security threats.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No further action or adjustment needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThe code is a typical, well-structured exception class module for the Requests library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
