  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling various error conditions in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs; standard exception class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or handling; no data leaks or injections.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; primarily class definitions without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for error handling in the Requests library, inheriting from built-in exceptions and other exception classes. It includes proper inheritance and comments explaining behavior. No code performs network operations, data processing, or untrusted data handling. The only noteworthy aspect is the comprehensive exception hierarchy, which is standard for robust error management. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of exception classes for a HTTP request library, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured error handling code.",
