  "purpose": "Defines data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), item setting (__setitem__), item retrieval (__getitem__), and get methods.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data output, network, or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (via constructor or item assignment) flows into internal storage (_store or __dict__). Data retrieval flows from internal storage to output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code appears to implement standard data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, well-known data structures (case-insensitive dict and lookup dict) without any code that executes external commands, network requests, or file operations. No input validation, sanitization, or malicious logic is present. The methods operate solely on internal data structures. No obfuscation or hidden code is present. The code adheres to typical design patterns for such structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used for internal data handling within the Requests library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is safe.",
