  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module implementing standard data structures with no malicious intent or security risks. The only technical flaw is the incorrect 'copy()' method, which does not pose security concerns. The overall assessment and scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the security risk score is minimal. No further action is necessary."
