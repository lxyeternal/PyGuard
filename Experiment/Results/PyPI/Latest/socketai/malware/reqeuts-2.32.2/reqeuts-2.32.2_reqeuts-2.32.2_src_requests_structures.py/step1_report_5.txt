{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and simple lookup dictionaries used in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), __getitem__, get, and update methods that read data and keys from external input or internal state.",
  "sinks": "None present. No code writes data to external sources, network, or files based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input data (from constructor or method calls) flows into internal storage (_store or __dict__), with no network or external system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, implements standard dictionary behavior, and does not include obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. Both are in-memory data structures inheriting from dict or collections. The first normalizes keys for case-insensitive access; the second is a simple lookup container. There are no external data flows, no code execution, network communication, or sensitive operations. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard data structure implementations used within the Requests library. No malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. The code is clear and does not perform any harmful actions.",
