  "purpose": "This script outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle provided by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs the CA bundle path to the console; no untrusted data flows or external data leaks are involved.",
  "flows": "The source ('where' function) flows directly into the print output, which is a benign operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and only performs a read and print operation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library function from the 'certifi' package to retrieve the default CA bundle location. It then prints this location when run as a script. There are no hardcoded credentials, no data leakage, no external network communications, and no obfuscated or suspicious code segments. The code performs a simple, intended function related to SSL certificate handling, with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that simply reports the location of a trusted CA bundle used for SSL verification. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
