  "purpose": "This script reports the path to the CA bundle provided by the certifi package, serving as an informational utility.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' module",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output (print of the CA bundle path)",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' -> print(where())",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted function from a well-known library and prints its output when executed. It performs a benign, intended function without processing untrusted input, performing network operations, or handling sensitive data. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity are consistent with its purpose, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, performing a simple informational task. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified. No further action or concern is necessary.",
