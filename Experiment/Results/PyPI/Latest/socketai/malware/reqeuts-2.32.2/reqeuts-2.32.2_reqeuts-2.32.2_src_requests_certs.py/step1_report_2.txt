{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple utility to print the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location from the 'where' function imported from certifi.",
  "sinks": "The output of the 'where' function is printed to standard output, which could be used for certificate validation processes.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function retrieves the CA bundle path (source), and the script outputs it (sink), but there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious or obfuscated constructs. No anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a known, reputable library (certifi) and outputs the path to its CA bundle. It does not process external input, nor does it contain any code that could be exploited. The purpose is informational and consistent with standard practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. The code is minimal, clear, and uses standard libraries only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs a simple function of printing the certifi CA bundle path. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
