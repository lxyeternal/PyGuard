{
  "purpose": "This module provides the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for establishing SSL/TLS connections securely.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path, which could be considered a data leak if the path reveals sensitive environment details, but generally it is not considered sensitive information.",
  "flows": "The code imports a trusted function 'where' and outputs its result; no untrusted input is processed or propagated.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses standard library functions without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports a known, trusted function from 'certifi' and prints the path to the CA bundle. It is designed to be informative and has no malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no data manipulation or suspicious logic. The code’s simplicity reduces the likelihood of malicious intent, and it functions as a utility script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely to display the default CA bundle path for SSL/TLS purposes. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
