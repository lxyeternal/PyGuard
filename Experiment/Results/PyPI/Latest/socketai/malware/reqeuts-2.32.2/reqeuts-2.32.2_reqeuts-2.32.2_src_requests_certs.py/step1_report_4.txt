  "purpose": "Provide the default CA bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from certifi import where'.",
  "sinks": "Printing the result of 'where()' to standard output.",
  "flows": "Import 'where' function -> call 'where()' -> print the output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code. The code simply prints a known certifi CA bundle path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package, which returns the path to the trusted CA bundle. When executed as a main program, it prints this path. The code is straightforward, has no external input, no network activity, and no suspicious logic or data handling. It serves a utility purpose and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely informational, providing the default CA bundle location. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security issues.",
