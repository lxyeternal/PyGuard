  "purpose": "Provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle using certifi for SSL verification.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the certifi package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to stdout.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' source provides the certificate path, which is then printed; no further data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code straightforwardly outputs the CA bundle path. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package, which returns the path to the CA bundle. When run as a script, it prints this path. The code performs a simple, intended function without any data processing, external network access, or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that outputs the default CA bundle path. It does not contain malware, malicious code, or security risks. It operates as intended with no suspicious behavior.",
