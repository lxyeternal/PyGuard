  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The report states the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious patterns. The only concern is the dynamic import of brotli, which is standard practice for optional dependencies.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are identified. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware score at 0.0, which aligns with the assessment. Security risk at 0.2 is slightly conservative but acceptable given the optional brotli support.\n- **Justification for Risk:** Since the code is purely decoding and chunking, with no external system interactions, a low risk score is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears safe, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the safe implementation of decoding utilities.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues found.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0.0, security risk at 0.1, which is reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, just standard decoding functions.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** Same as above, with detailed reasoning supporting safety.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No flaws.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0.0, security risk at 0.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity; the code is purely for decoding.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** Consistent with previous reports; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0.0, security risk at 0.1, which is reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No external network activity or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe utility code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** Same as above; the code is straightforward content decoding.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0.0, security risk at 0.1.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, just decoding functions.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is consistent with the code's functionality. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate no obfuscation, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** The scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code, which is appropriate given its purpose.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Very low, consistent with the code's function.\n\n**Note:** Given the comprehensive analysis, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a standard, well-structured set of content decoders with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware        | **0.0**              |\n| Obfuscated     | **0.0**              |\n| Security Risk  | **0.1**              |\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's functionality.",
