{
  "purpose": "Provides various content decoding classes for handling HTTP content-encoding, including support for 'identity', 'gzip', 'deflate', 'brotli', and multi-encoding scenarios.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (codecs, io, typing, zlib), local modules (_compat, _exceptions), and external 'brotli' library.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data directly to external systems, network, or files. It mainly processes and decodes data streams internally.",
  "flows": "Input data (bytes/str) flows into decoding methods, possibly through multiple layers (MultiDecoder), and is returned as decoded data. No external untrusted data flows into system commands or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious control flows. The code handles decoding operations safely. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. The only external dependency is 'brotli', handled with import checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various classes for handling content decoding, with clear separation of responsibilities. It employs standard libraries and a well-known third-party library for Brotli support, with appropriate error handling. The 'BrotliDecoder' dynamically adapts to the available package. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward, focusing solely on decoding streams securely. The 'SUPPORTED_DECODERS' dict is a registry for decoder classes, with safe handling of missing dependencies. No code injection, code execution, or system manipulation code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of content decoders with no malicious intent. It performs safe decoding of compressed data streams. There are no suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified.",
