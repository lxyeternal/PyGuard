{
  "purpose": "Provides content decoding classes supporting identity, gzip, deflate, brotli, and multi-encoding, along with chunking utilities for bytes and text, and line decoding.",
  "sources": "Input data for decode methods in each decoder, chunkers, and line decoders.",
  "sinks": "Decoded output data; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through decoder objects, possibly through multiple decoders in sequence, then outputted; chunkers and line decoders process data incrementally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or external network activity; brotli dependency is handled with standard conditional import.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of content decoders supporting common compression algorithms, with error handling and optional dependencies. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The handling of optional brotli support is conventional. The chunkers and line decoders operate on in-memory buffers without external interactions. The error handling is appropriate, and the code structure is clear and readable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured set of content decoders and stream utilities with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified. There are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors present.",
