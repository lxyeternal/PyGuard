  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The report correctly identifies that the code handles HTTP authentication, with data flowing into headers and challenge parsing.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `os.urandom` for nonce generation is standard cryptographic practice.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report concludes no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and standard practices are followed. The confidence is high (0.95), and malware risk is 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of HTTP auth schemes. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly notes handling of headers, challenge parsing, and request modification.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets; standard modules used.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The implementation is standard and secure. Confidence is high (0.9), malware risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Again, a legitimate, well-structured auth module.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Properly describes credential handling, challenge parsing, and header creation.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns. Use of `os.urandom` for nonce generation is appropriate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Standard cryptographic practices. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; code appears secure and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar observations about input sources and header setting.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, nonce generation is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard implementation with no malicious intent. Confidence 0.95, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly notes data flow into headers, challenge parsing, and credential handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets; standard practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no malicious network behavior. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:** All signs point to a secure, standard implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** No.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware risk score:** Consistently 0 across all reports.\n- **Security risk score:** Low (~0.1-0.2), aligned with standard authentication code.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard authentication code)\n\nThe code is a typical, well-implemented HTTP authentication module, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The use of cryptographically secure nonce generation and standard libraries further supports its legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, standard, and secure.**",
