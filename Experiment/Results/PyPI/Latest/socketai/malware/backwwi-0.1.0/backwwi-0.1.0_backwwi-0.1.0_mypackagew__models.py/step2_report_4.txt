  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and logical consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The report states the code is a standard HTTP client implementation with headers, cookies, streaming, decoding, and error handling. No suspicious data flows or external code execution.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code uses typical patterns for an HTTP client library.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk, malware score 0, high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's nature. No issues detected. The score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard HTTP handling, cookies, and decoding. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Clear, standard implementation with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malware, low risk, high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Again, standard HTTP request/response handling, cookie management, streaming, decoding.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. No external network activity or code execution.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk, malware score 0, high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n\n- **Analysis:** This is not an anomaly in itself; it could be a network error or a server issue. It doesn't imply malicious activity.\n\n- **Risk & Malware:** No malicious behavior indicated.\n\n**Assessment:** No security concern here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes standard handling of HTTP data, no malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of sabotage or malicious intent. The code handles untrusted data safely.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk, malware score 0, high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree the code is a standard, well-structured HTTP client library.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or sabotage.\n- Scores for malware are all 0, and security risks are low.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting thorough assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- **Risk score:** Overall low, around 0.1–0.2, reflecting standard library functionality.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears secure, with no supply chain or malicious activity concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
