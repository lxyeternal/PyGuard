{
  "purpose": "The code implements HTTP request and response handling, including headers, cookies, and data streaming, for a web client or server environment.",
  "sources": "Input data includes request parameters, headers, cookies, and streams, as well as response content, headers, and streams. Data is read from streams, headers, cookies, and request attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are data serialization (json), header access/modification, cookie management, and stream reading methods. No direct data leaks or malicious data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (headers, cookies, streams) flows into internal processing (headers normalization, cookie setting, stream reading). No evidence of malicious data flow or injection points is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code appears standard for an HTTP client/server library. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive implementation of HTTP request and response objects, including cookie management, headers normalization, streaming, and decoding. All data handling follows typical patterns with no signs of malicious behavior. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The cookie handling and header processing are standard, and stream reading methods are straightforward. No anomalies or suspicious code sections were found. Overall, this code appears to be a standard, well-structured HTTP utility module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard HTTP request/response handling library with no detectable malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain security threats. It functions as expected for such a library, with no suspicious signals or anomalies.",
