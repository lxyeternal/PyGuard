{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for handling HTTP requests, responses, headers, and cookies in a web client/server context, including support for streaming content, decoding, and cookie management.",
  "sources": "Input sources include headers, request parameters, URL, cookies, and response streams. Data is read from network streams, headers, cookies, and URL components.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing cookies to headers, setting request headers, and reading response content. Cookie setting and request header modifications are performed, as well as reading and decoding response streams.",
  "flows": "Data flows from network streams or input parameters into internal buffers; headers and cookies are set or retrieved; response content is decoded and yielded; cookies are extracted or set based on headers. No external or untrusted code execution or data manipulation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for an HTTP client library; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No obfuscation or unusual language features are detected. The cookie management and header processing are typical and safe. No system commands, network connections to suspicious domains, or malicious data leaks are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code implements typical HTTP request/response and cookie handling functionalities, including streaming, decoding, and error management. It carefully manages headers, encoding, and stream states. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hidden backdoors, secret exfiltration, or system sabotage. All functions appear to perform expected roles within an HTTP client context. No unsafe eval, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of an HTTP client library with proper handling of headers, cookies, streaming, and encoding. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms. Its security risk score is low, and malware likelihood is minimal.",
