  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is solely composed of type definitions, data structures, and abstract classes for stream handling. There are no functions executing untrusted data, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The classes `SyncByteStream` and `AsyncByteStream` are abstract, meant to be subclassed, with no embedded malicious logic.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that the code is purely structural with no runtime or data processing components. They correctly note the absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. The security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is only type annotations and interface definitions, and no actual data processing or network activity occurs, there is no basis for assigning a high risk score. The code is safe and standard for a type-checking module.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   The malware scores are all 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code's role as a foundational, non-executing part of a larger library.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. The high confidence (1.0) and zero malware and security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions and abstract classes for an HTTP client library. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (correct, no malicious code detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (correct, code is clear and standard)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (correct, no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a safe, standard part of a type-safe HTTP client library, serving as interface and type definitions without executing or processing untrusted data. The existing scores are appropriate and justified.",
