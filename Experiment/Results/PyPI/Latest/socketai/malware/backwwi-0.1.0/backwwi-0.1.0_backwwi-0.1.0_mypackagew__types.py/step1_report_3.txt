{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and interface classes for HTTP request handling and data management in a Python library, likely for an HTTP client or similar.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and class method definitions; no data input or external data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external data output, or network operations; only method signatures and type definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily structural code with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The class methods are unimplemented or abstract, serving as interfaces.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type aliases, data structures, and interface classes designed for type checking and extensibility in an HTTP context. It imports standard and type hint modules, declares various union types for request parameters, headers, cookies, SSL configurations, and files. The classes 'SyncByteStream' and 'AsyncByteStream' are abstract, meant to be subclassed with implementations for streaming data. No actual data processing, network operations, or executable logic are present. No suspicious code or malicious behavior is detected; the code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured set of type definitions and interface classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural and type annotation in nature, with no runtime behavior or data handling that could be malicious. It serves as a foundation for a larger library, likely for HTTP requests, without any indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
