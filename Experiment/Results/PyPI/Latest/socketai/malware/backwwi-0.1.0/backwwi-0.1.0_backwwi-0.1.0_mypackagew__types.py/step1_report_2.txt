  "purpose": "Type definitions for type checking purposes in an HTTP client library, including various data types, configurations, and stream classes.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily contains type definitions, imports, and class interfaces.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or handling of untrusted input/output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as the code is purely type annotations and interface definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code contains standard type annotations, class interfaces, and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various type aliases for data used in HTTP requests and responses, including URL, headers, cookies, SSL verification, timeouts, proxies, authentication, and streaming classes. It includes interface definitions for synchronous and asynchronous byte streams. There are no functions that process data dynamically, no handling of untrusted input, and no evidence of malicious behavior. The code appears to serve as a foundation for an HTTP client library with no embedded or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for type annotations and interface definitions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not handle data directly, and there are no suspicious patterns or code execution. The overall security risk is negligible.",
