  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code consists solely of type aliases, data structures, and abstract classes serving as interfaces for an HTTP client library.\n- All classes and functions are either placeholders or abstract, with no data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- Imports are standard, and no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code appears to be a foundational module for type checking and interface enforcement, not executable logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** No issues found; code is safe, standard, and purely for type annotations.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — justified, as there's no active logic or vulnerabilities.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1; no anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — no active processing or vulnerabilities.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — straightforward type definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, purely structural, interface, and type annotations.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern; no dynamic code, no data handling, no network activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely structural code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no issues detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. Given the code's nature, I agree with a malware score of **0.0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, standard, and straightforward; obfuscation is not present. I concur with **0.0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely type definitions and abstract classes with no runtime logic, the overall security risk is negligible. I would assign a **0.0** to the risk score for all reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\nThe code provided is a foundational, type-focused module for an HTTP client library. It contains no executable logic, no data processing, no network calls, and no embedded malicious code. All classes are abstract or placeholders, meant for extension, and the imports are standard. The analysis confirms the absence of vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malware.\n\n**Therefore, my final assessment is:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses provided in each report and confirms the code's safety profile.",
