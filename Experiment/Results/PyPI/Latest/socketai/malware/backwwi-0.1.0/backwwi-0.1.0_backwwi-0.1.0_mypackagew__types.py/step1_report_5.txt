  "purpose": "Type definitions and interface classes for HTTP request handling and type checking in a Python library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (ssl, http.cookiejar, typing) and internal modules (prefixed with ._). Type annotations and type alias definitions.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only defines types and interfaces without executing any untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "N/A — The code is purely declarative with no data flow execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type aliases, class definitions, and placeholder classes for stream handling. It imports standard libraries without executing any code. The class methods raise NotImplementedError or pass, indicating these are interfaces meant to be implemented elsewhere. No data processing, input/output, or network communication occurs within this code. All structures appear consistent with typical type declaration practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type definitions, class interfaces, and imports intended for a larger HTTP client library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It does not contain any obfuscated or malicious code. Overall, this appears to be a safe, non-executing module solely for type checking and interface definitions.",
