{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases, data structures, and abstract classes for an HTTP client library, facilitating type checking and interface extension.",
  "sources": "Imports standard modules (ssl, http.cookiejar, typing) and internal modules for authentication, configuration, models, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only declares types and abstract classes without data flow or processing.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code does not execute; it provides type annotations and interface definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type aliases, data structures, and abstract classes intended for extension. It contains no runtime logic, network calls, or data processing. Imports are standard, and the classes serve as interfaces with placeholder methods. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The code is purely structural, aimed at type safety and extensibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions and abstract classes for an HTTP client library. It contains no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports—malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, risk: 0.0—are accurate and justified.",
