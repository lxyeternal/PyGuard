  "purpose": "Type definitions for type checking purposes in an HTTP client library.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library modules (ssl, http.cookiejar, typing) and internal modules (._auth, ._config, ._models, ._urls) during type checking.",
  "sinks": "None; this code defines types and abstract classes without executing untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive sinks; the code primarily declares types and interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets. The classes are abstract, meant for extension.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases, data structures, and abstract classes for stream handling, primarily used in a network client context. There are no functions executing untrusted data, no network calls, and no dynamic code execution. The imports and type annotations are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. The abstract classes are placeholders meant for extension, with no embedded malicious logic. Overall, this appears to be a standard, safe type definition module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type definitions and abstract classes for network stream handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical part of a well-structured HTTP client library designed for extendability and type safety.",
