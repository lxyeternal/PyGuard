  "purpose": "Type definitions and interface classes for HTTP request handling, type checking, and resource management in a Python HTTP client library.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions, import statements, and placeholder methods.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code defines interfaces and type aliases only, with no data processing or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows involving untrusted data or external inputs within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of type definitions, imports, and interface classes with placeholder methods.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes type aliases for various data structures used in an HTTP client context, including URL components, headers, cookies, and request/response content. It defines interface classes for synchronous and asynchronous byte streams with unimplemented methods intended for subclassing. All functions and classes serve as structural definitions or placeholders, with no actual data processing, network activity, or external data handling present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, providing type annotations and abstract classes for a larger HTTP client framework. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe and intended solely for type checking and interface enforcement within a legitimate library.",
