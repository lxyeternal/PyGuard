  "purpose": "Embedded obfuscated payload executing remote code via base64 decoding and exec(), indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded and executed with exec(), which performs network requests, file writes, and subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executing decoded code; network request functions; subprocess calls; file write operations.",
  "flows": "Base64 string decoded -> exec() executes payload -> payload makes network requests, writes files, executes system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding combined with exec() to conceal malicious code; import of suspicious modules like requests and subprocess within payload.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a base64-encoded string decoded and executed via exec(), which is a common obfuscation tactic. The decoded payload performs network requests, downloads, and executes remote code, indicating high malicious intent. The structure outside the payload appears legitimate, but the embedded code's behavior is suspicious and potentially harmful. The use of exec() with encoded payloads is a strong indicator of malicious activity, and the payload's actions pose significant security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, involving obfuscated remote code execution. The embedded payload's behavior justifies high malware and security risk scores. The pattern of obfuscation and malicious activity warrants immediate review and removal from the supply chain.",
