  "flows": [
    "The code imports modules, defines the package structure, and then executes a base64-decoded payload via exec.",
    "The decoded payload involves network requests (requests library), process execution (subprocess), and threading.",
    "Potentially, the decoded payload could perform malicious actions such as network communication, system command execution, or data exfiltration."

  "anomalies": [
    "Use of exec() with base64-decoded data, which is often a red flag for obfuscated malicious code.",
    "Importing standard libraries (requests, subprocess, threading, os) and then executing code that appears to perform network requests and process execution.",
    "The inline base64-encoded string decodes to code that makes an HTTP request, and if a response is received, it writes the response to a file and executes it using subprocess.",
    "The pattern resembles typical malicious behavior such as downloading and executing remote code."
  ],
  "analysis": "The initial part of the code imports various modules for HTTP handling and internal package structure, which appears legitimate for a network client library. However, the critical concern is the embedded base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed at runtime. This payload performs an HTTP GET request to a specific IP address, and if the response status is 200, it writes the response content to a file and executes it via subprocess. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, including remote code execution, malware download, or command-and-control communication. The use of exec() with decoded code indicates obfuscation intended to hide malicious intent. The overall structure suggests an attempt to conceal malicious operations within a legitimate-looking package.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious embedded payload that downloads and executes remote code, indicative of malicious activity. The use of obfuscation via base64 decoding and exec() further supports malicious intent. This package should be considered unsafe until further analysis confirms otherwise.",
