{
  "purpose": "The code defines a comprehensive hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling various HTTP, network, protocol, stream, and request errors within an HTTP client library. It facilitates structured error reporting and debugging.",
  "sources": "Exception instantiation with static messages; request and response objects attached via properties and context manager.",
  "sinks": "Potential attachment points for request and response objects, which could contain sensitive data, but are used here solely for debugging and error context.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised with messages and optional request/response objects; the context manager attaches request objects to exceptions during error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, dynamic execution, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward class definitions with no external data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured exception hierarchy for an HTTP client, with clear inheritance and purpose. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. Exception messages are static, and request/response objects are attached in a controlled manner for debugging. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports (around 0.1) is justified by the potential exposure of request data, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky. Overall, the code serves as error handling infrastructure without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured exception hierarchy used for error management in an HTTP client library. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned across reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
