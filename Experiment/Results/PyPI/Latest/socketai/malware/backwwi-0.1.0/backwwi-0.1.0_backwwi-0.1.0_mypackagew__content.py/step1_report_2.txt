{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for encoding request and response data into byte streams with appropriate headers, supporting multiple content types including JSON, HTML, plain text, multipart, and URL-encoded data.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'content', 'data', 'files', 'json', 'text', and 'html'; internal functions like 'peek_filelike_length' and 'primitive_value_to_str'.",
  "sinks": "ByteStream and MultipartStream objects that produce byte output; headers dictionaries that include content-related headers.",
  "flows": "Input data (sources) flows into encoding functions, which produce headers and byte stream outputs, used for HTTP request/response payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect.isgenerator and inspect.isasyncgen to determine stream types; warning for 'data' parameter not being a mapping, which could lead to misinterpretation but is documented. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides mechanisms to encode various data types into byte streams suitable for HTTP communications, with support for streaming and multipart data. It performs type checks, adds appropriate headers, and handles both synchronous and asynchronous streams. The functions appear standard and intended for data serialization, with no signs of malicious or sabotage code. Usage of warnings and custom stream classes aligns with expected design for an HTTP client or server utility. No anomalous behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for encoding HTTP payloads, with no malicious intent or sabotage. It handles data serialization securely and predictably, with no suspicious patterns or behavior. All operations are consistent with normal HTTP data handling tasks.",
