  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding HTTP request and response content, managing streams, and setting appropriate headers for various data types.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as 'content', 'data', 'files', 'json', 'text', 'html' which are read to determine encoding; stream objects like bytes, iterables, async iterables.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission via ByteStream, AsyncByteStream, MultipartStream; JSON serialization for JSON content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through encoding functions into stream objects, which are then used for network transmission, with headers set accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect to detect generator types; deprecation warning for 'data' parameter; no suspicious code patterns or hardcoded secrets; standard stream management.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utilities for encoding various content types into streams suitable for HTTP requests/responses. It manages stream states properly, raises exceptions on misuse, and sets headers correctly. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The use of warnings and inspection functions are standard practices. The overall structure is clear, and the code is straightforward, indicating benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard utility for HTTP content encoding and stream management. No indicators of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores are consistent with its benign, utility nature.",
