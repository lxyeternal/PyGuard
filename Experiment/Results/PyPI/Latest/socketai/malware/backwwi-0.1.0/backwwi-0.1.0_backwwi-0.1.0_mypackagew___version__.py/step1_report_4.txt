  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Pure metadata assignment with no functional code; no anomalies present.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns string literals to module-level variables representing the package's title, description, and version. There are no dynamic operations, input handling, or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a standard metadata declaration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package metadata declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
