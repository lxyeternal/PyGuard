  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'httpx' Python library, including title, description, and version.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains variable assignments for metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as there are no input sources or data manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward metadata assignment without any unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets string variables for package metadata. There are no dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious operations. The simplicity indicates standard package setup information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package metadata declaration with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
