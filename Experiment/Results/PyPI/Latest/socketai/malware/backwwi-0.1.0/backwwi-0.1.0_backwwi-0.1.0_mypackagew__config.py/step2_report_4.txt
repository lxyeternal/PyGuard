  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is SSL/TLS configuration for an HTTP client, with environment variable support, CA bundle handling, and client cert loading.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious behaviors detected. Uses standard libraries and practices. Environment variables like SSLKEYLOGFILE are for debugging, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These seem reasonable given the context.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears secure and legitimate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar SSL/TLS setup, with environment variable 'SSLKEYLOGFILE' and CA bundle handling.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity. Use of environment variables for debugging is standard. Proxy URL parsing and masking credentials are correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or sabotage detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** SSL configuration, timeouts, limits, proxies.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity. Use of environment variables for key logging is standard but should be monitored.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure configuration, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** SSL, timeouts, limits, proxies, environment variables.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. Use of SSLKEYLOGFILE is for debugging, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure configuration code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** SSL, proxies, environment variables.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation. Environment variables are standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Slightly lower risk, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Well-structured, safe code.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Use of environment variables:** Standard practice, primarily for debugging (SSLKEYLOGFILE). No malicious intent.\n- **Certificate handling:** Properly managed, no suspicious modifications.\n- **Proxy handling:** Correctly sanitizes credentials, no backdoors.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low (around 0.1–0.2), which aligns with the findings.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal operational risk, mostly related to environment variable use for debugging.\n\n### Final conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, secure implementation for SSL/TLS configuration, timeouts, limits, and proxies in an HTTP client. No signs of supply chain compromise, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The minor risks are related to environment variables used for debugging, which are common and not inherently dangerous.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment confirms the code's integrity and safety.",
