  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of os.system, which could be risky if inputs were dynamic, but here, it is safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the minor concern with command execution practices."
