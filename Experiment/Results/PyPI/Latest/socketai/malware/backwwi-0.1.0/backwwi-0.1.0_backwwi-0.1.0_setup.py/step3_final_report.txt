  "purpose": "Standard setup.py for packaging and distribution of a Python package, including a custom upload command.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description, loads version info, and executes system commands for build, upload, and git tagging.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.system to run 'setup.py sdist bdist_wheel', 'twine upload', and git commands; no external input influences these commands.",
  "flows": "Static commands executed during setup; no external data flows into these commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity, and no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with a custom command for uploading the package. It employs os.system for executing build and upload commands, which is not best practice but not malicious in this static context. No external input influences these commands, and no secrets or malicious payloads are present. The script performs expected packaging tasks with no signs of sabotage or malware. The use of os.system introduces a minor security concern, but given the static commands, the risk remains low.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of os.system, which could be risky if inputs were dynamic, but here, it is safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the minor concern with command execution practices.",
