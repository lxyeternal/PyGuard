  "purpose": "The script is a setup.py configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project, including upload functionality via Twine.",
  "sources": "os.system calls for 'setup.py sdist bdist_wheel --universal', 'twine upload dist/*', 'git tag', and 'git push', which execute external commands; file reading for long_description; environment variables for sys.executable.",
  "sinks": "External commands executed via os.system could be influenced if input is manipulated, but in this static code, these are safe as they don't process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Setup script reads project info -> executes system commands for build/upload -> uses exec to load version info -> runs git commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with static strings is generally safe here; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code; no suspicious network activity or backdoors; no input validation issues identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks with no dynamic or malicious code. The only potentially sensitive action is executing system commands, but these are static and predictable. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The version is loaded from a static variable, not external input. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project, with no malicious or suspicious features. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks beyond the normal scope of build scripts.",
