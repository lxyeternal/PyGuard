{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (machine name, OS, IP address) and exfiltrates it to an external webhook URL during package installation, potentially for malicious data theft.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), platform.system(), requests.get() to external URLs",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to the webhook URL, sending data externally",
  "flows": "source (system info) -> request to external URL (webhook) -> data exfiltration",
  "anomalies": "No error handling for network requests; data exfiltration during install without user consent; silent execution; use of a test webhook URL",
  "analysis": "The code performs network requests to retrieve IP and send system info to an external URL during package installation. It lacks exception handling, making it vulnerable to silent failures. The URL used appears to be a test endpoint, but the behavior indicates potential malicious intent to exfiltrate data covertly. The reports only mention 'Empty response' errors, likely due to network issues or invalid URLs, not code flaws. Given the data exfiltration activity, the malware score should be high (~0.9), and the security risk score should also be high (~0.8), reflecting privacy invasion and malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system data during installation. The 'Empty response' reports are due to network or URL issues, not code errors. The malware and risk scores should be set high, acknowledging the privacy and security threat posed by the data leakage.",
