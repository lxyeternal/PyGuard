{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, with the apparent intention of demonstrating or exploiting a dependency confusion vulnerability.",
  "sources": "The requests.get call to a URL during the setup process, reading the README.md file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "The GET request to an external URL acts as a network sink where data could be sent or triggered.",
  "flows": "Code execution during package setup triggers the requests.get call, which connects to an external domain, potentially leaking information or confirming active status.",
  "anomalies": "The requests.get request occurs directly in the setup script, which is unusual and suspicious. The package metadata suggests malicious intent ('Dependency confusion Attack') and the description explicitly mentions a vulnerability exploitation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup utilities and requests library. It performs a GET request to a suspicious domain at import time, likely to signal or verify the attacker’s infrastructure. The rest of the code reads a README file and sets up package metadata, typical for Python packages, but the inclusion of a network request during setup is suspicious. The description and package name imply malicious intent related to dependency confusion attacks, which often involve poisoning package repositories or manipulating dependencies.\n\nThe code does not contain other malicious behavior such as data theft, backdoors, or system manipulation beyond the initial network call, but the intent and context imply malicious purpose.\n\nThe external URL is a Canary token or a tracker, indicating the code's purpose is to confirm or signal deployment rather than normal package installation behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is malicious in intent, designed to make a network request during installation, likely for tracking, confirmation, or malicious control. The overall structure appears typical, but the embedded GET request and the package description suggest malicious behavior targeting supply chain attacks.",
