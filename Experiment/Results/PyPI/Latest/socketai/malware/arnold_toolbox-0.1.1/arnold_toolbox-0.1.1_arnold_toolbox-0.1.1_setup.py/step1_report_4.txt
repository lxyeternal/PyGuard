{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'arnold-toolbox', with intentionally malicious intent to demonstrate dependency confusion vulnerability and perform a remote check.",
  "sources": "requests.get call to an external URL during package installation",
  "sinks": "The external GET request potentially leaks installation activity or triggers malicious server-side actions",
  "flows": "On executing setup(), the code makes a GET request to the specified URL, which may be used for tracking or malicious purposes",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an external GET request during installation without any validation or user consent; the description indicates malicious intent ('Dependency confusion Attack')",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions and requests module, then immediately executes requests.get() to a URL, which is outside standard setup procedures and indicates malicious behavior or tracking. The long description explicitly states 'Dependency confusion Attack', suggesting an intent to exploit package vulnerabilities. No other suspicious code or obfuscation is present. The external request during setup is a clear anomaly, as it can leak information or trigger malicious actions. Overall, the code appears intentionally malicious, designed to perform a remote action during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code that performs an external GET request during installation, likely for tracking, data leakage, or malicious purposes related to dependency confusion attacks. The intent and behavior are malicious.",
