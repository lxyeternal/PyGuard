{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform a malicious network request during package setup, likely for tracking, command-and-control, or exfiltration purposes.",
  "sources": "The line 'requests.get(\"https://g5mr93si9nwr0vblbcuk1fp4cvim6du2.oastify.com\")' executed during setup, which contacts an external URL.",
  "sinks": "The external URL request acts as a sink, potentially leaking data or enabling remote control, especially during installation.",
  "flows": "The source is the 'requests.get()' call during setup; the sink is the external network request to the suspicious URL.",
  "anomalies": "The network request occurs during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious; no other malicious or obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks but includes a malicious GET request to a Canary token URL during installation, indicating malicious intent. The request is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The URL suggests tracking or C2 activity. The scores in the reports (malware: ~0.9-1, security risk: ~0.9-1) are justified given this behavior. The code's purpose aligns with malicious activity, and the external request during setup is a high-severity indicator.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains explicit malicious behavior via an external network request during installation, indicating high malicious intent and security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the package should be considered malicious and avoided.",
