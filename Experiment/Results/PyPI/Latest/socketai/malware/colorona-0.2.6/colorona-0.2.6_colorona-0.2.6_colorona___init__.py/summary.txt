  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high malicious intent, primarily designed for covert data collection (credentials, tokens, system info) and exfiltration to external servers. The use of obfuscated URLs and data harvesting functions indicates malicious spyware behavior. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware likelihood is near maximum."
