  "purpose": "The code is used to define the setup process for a Python package distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a library and executes a function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code simply calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with no arguments, which is a common and benign pattern for package setup. No external data is read, and no malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The code appears to be a standard setup script with no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign setup script used for packaging Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
