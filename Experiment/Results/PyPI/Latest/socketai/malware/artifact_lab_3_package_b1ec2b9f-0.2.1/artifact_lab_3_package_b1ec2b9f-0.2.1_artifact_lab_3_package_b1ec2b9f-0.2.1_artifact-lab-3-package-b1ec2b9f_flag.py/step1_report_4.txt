{
  "purpose": "The code collects environment variables, encodes them in base64, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to an external URL.",
  "sources": "os.environ (reads environment variables), str() conversion",
  "sinks": "requests.post (sends data to an external server)",
  "flows": "os.environ -> str -> encode to ASCII -> base64 encode -> decode to ASCII -> send via requests.post",
  "anomalies": "Unusual encoding and transmission of environment variables to an external URL; no clear legitimate purpose; the URL appears suspicious and is hosted on a known malicious domain (oast.fun).",
  "analysis": "The code captures all environment variables, encodes them in base64, and sends this data to an external domain. This behavior resembles data exfiltration, especially since it targets a suspicious domain. The use of base64 encoding may be to obfuscate the data during transmission. There are no input validation or user interactions; the code is straightforward but potentially malicious in intent, aimed at stealing environment data.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs environment data collection and exfiltration to a suspicious external server without any legitimate context. This pattern is characteristic of malicious data theft or backdoor behavior. The URL used is suspicious and likely malicious.",
