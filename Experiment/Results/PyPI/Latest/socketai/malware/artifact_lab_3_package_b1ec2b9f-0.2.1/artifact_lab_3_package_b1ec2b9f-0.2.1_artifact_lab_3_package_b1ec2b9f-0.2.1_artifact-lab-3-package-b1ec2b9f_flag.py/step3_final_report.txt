{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates all environment variables by encoding them in base64 and sending them via HTTP POST to a suspicious external URL.",
  "sources": "The environment variables accessed through os.environ, converted to string, encoded in ASCII, then base64 encoded.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post call sending data to the external URL, which acts as the data exfiltration point.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> string conversion -> ASCII encoding -> base64 encoding -> HTTP POST request to external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a suspicious external URL, straightforward base64 encoding without obfuscation, exfiltration of potentially sensitive data without validation or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code reads all environment variables, encodes them in base64, and transmits them to an external server, indicating data exfiltration. The URL is suspicious, and no safeguards are present. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and performs a malicious action. The behavior aligns with malicious intent, justifying high malware and security risk scores. The code does not execute malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration but clearly aims to steal environment data covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing environment data exfiltration to a suspicious external URL. It is not obfuscated but exhibits high malicious intent, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
