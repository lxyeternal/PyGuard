  "purpose": "Collects environment variables, encodes them in base64, and sends them via HTTP POST to an external URL.",
  "sources": "os.environ (environment variables)",
  "sinks": "requests.post (sending data over the network to an external server)",
  "flows": "os.environ -> encode -> base64 encode -> send via requests.post",
  "anomalies": "The code encodes all environment variables and transmits them to an external domain without any apparent user interaction or validation; the target URL is suspicious and external.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers all environment variables, encodes them in base64, and posts the data to an external server. The external server's URL appears suspicious and possibly malicious, indicating an attempt to exfiltrate environment data. There are no input validation or safeguards; the purpose seems to be data exfiltration or spying. The code does not perform any other function or display malicious actions beyond data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables to an external, suspicious URL without consent or validation. It is likely intended for data theft or spying.",
