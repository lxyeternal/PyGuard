  "purpose": "The code collects environment variables, encodes them in base64, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables using os.environ",
  "sinks": "Sending data over HTTP POST request to an external server",
  "flows": "Environment variables (source) are encoded in base64, then transmitted via HTTP POST (sink)",
  "anomalies": "The code extracts all environment variables, encodes them, and transmits them without any validation or user input filtering. The target URL appears suspicious and is not a standard domain; this could be used for exfiltration. The variable 'env' is converted to string before encoding, which is redundant but not malicious alone.",
  "analysis": "The script accesses all environment variables, encodes the complete set in base64, and sends this data to an external domain via a POST request. The destination domain looks suspicious and may be used for data exfiltration. There are no other malicious functions, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The process is straightforward but could be used maliciously for privacy invasion or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be collecting sensitive environment data and exfiltrating it to an external server, which could be malicious or maliciously intended. Given the suspicious domain and data collection pattern, this behavior is potentially malicious and warrants caution.",
