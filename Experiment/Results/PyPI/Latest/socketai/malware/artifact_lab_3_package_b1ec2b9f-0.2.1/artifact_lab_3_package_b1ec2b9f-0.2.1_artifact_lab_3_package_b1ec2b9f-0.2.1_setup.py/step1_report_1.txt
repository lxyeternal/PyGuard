{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up and configuring a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version), dependencies ('requests'), and package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; dependencies are predefined static strings, and package metadata is hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. The dependencies are standard, and the setup code appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' functions to define package setup parameters, including name, version, packages, and required dependencies. No code executes untrusted data, dynamic code, or insecure operations. The only inputs are static strings for package configuration, which are typical for setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code appears to be a straightforward package setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It follows typical conventions for Python packaging without any suspicious elements.",
