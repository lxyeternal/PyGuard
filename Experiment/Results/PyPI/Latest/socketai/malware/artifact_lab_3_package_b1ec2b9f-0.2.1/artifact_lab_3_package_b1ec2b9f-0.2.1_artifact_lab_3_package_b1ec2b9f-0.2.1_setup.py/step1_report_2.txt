  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded package name, version, and dependencies in the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward setup configuration with standard usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It contains a static package name, version, and a list of required packages. There are no dynamic inputs, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The dependencies are standard Python packages with version specifications. No signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not include any network operations, file manipulations, or other potentially dangerous activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
