{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the package setup for distribution via setuptools",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata and dependencies from the code, specifically the setup() function parameters",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data affects system security or leaks occur",
  "flows": "The setup() function reads static package information and dependencies; no dynamic or external data flows are observed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior; the code appears standard for a setup script",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, defines a setup configuration with package name, version, and dependencies. It uses find_packages() to automatically include packages and specifies a dependency on 'requests' version 2.32.3 or higher. No obfuscated code, malicious commands, or external data handling are present. The dependencies are common, and no suspicious logic or code injection points are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
