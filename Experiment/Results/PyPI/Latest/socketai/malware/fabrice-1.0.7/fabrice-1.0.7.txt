The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.3 to 0.4, primarily due to embedded secrets. The overall security posture is moderate, with the main concern being secret handling rather than malicious activity."

The scores assigned by the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.2—are appropriate. Given the context, the risk score could be further lowered to 0.1, reflecting the minimal threat level of this testing code."

The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 to 0.2, justified by the use of a hardcoded sudo password in a testing context. Overall, it poses minimal security risk and is safe for use in testing environments."
