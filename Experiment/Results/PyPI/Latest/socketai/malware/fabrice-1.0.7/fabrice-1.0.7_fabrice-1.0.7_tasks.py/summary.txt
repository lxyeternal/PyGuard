  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build and deployment script with insecure secret management practices. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.3 to 0.4, primarily due to embedded secrets. The overall security posture is moderate, with the main concern being secret handling rather than malicious activity."
