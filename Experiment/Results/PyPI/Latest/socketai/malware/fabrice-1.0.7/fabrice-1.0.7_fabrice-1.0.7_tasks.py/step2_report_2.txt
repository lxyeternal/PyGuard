  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build, release, and testing automation.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, config, code imports.\n- **Sinks:** Uses c.run() for commands, environment variables.\n- **Flows:** Environment variables influence build behavior; commands executed accordingly.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded credentials ('sikrit', 'mypass'), environment variables for secrets, no malicious code observed.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward build script with security concern due to embedded secrets. No malware, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate automation with a notable security weakness (hardcoded secrets).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion and confidence seem reasonable. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.3-0.4 (due to secrets). The malware score is correctly 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar build/deploy tasks.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, hardcoded credentials ('sikrit'), sys.path modifications.\n- **Sinks:** c.run(), environment variables.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets ('sikrit', gateway info), sys.path manipulation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, but insecure practices (hardcoded secrets, environment setup). No malware signatures.\n- **Conclusion:** Security risks due to secrets, but no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's risk score of 0.4 and malware 0 are appropriate. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build, test, release, with environment variables.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, config, hardcoded secrets ('sikrit', 'fabric<2').\n- **Sinks:** c.run(), environment variables.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets, environment variable reliance, sys.path modifications.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, but insecure handling of secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Similar to others, security risk mainly from poor secret management.\n\n**Assessment:** Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, risk around 0.4, consistent with the report.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build, test, release, similar to above.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, config, hardcoded secrets ('sikrit').\n- **Sinks:** c.run(), environment variables.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded credentials, sys.path manipulation.\n- **Analysis:** No malware, but insecure practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Same pattern; low malware risk, security concern primarily from secrets.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build and testing with secrets.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, config, hardcoded secrets ('sikrit', 'env.gateway').\n- **Sinks:** c.run(), environment variables.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded credentials, sys.path changes.\n- **Analysis:** No malware, just insecure secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, security risk from secrets.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores align well.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious payloads, network exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** Moderate (0.3-0.4), mainly due to hardcoded secrets and insecure practices, not active malware or obfuscation.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code or payloads)  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and readable)  \n**Risk:** 0.4 (due to embedded secrets and insecure practices)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard build script with significant security concerns around secret management but no malicious intent or malware. The current scores are appropriate, but the primary concern should be refactoring to remove hardcoded secrets.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is legitimate automation, not malware.  \n- The security risk stems from poor secret handling, not malicious activity.  \n- Scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n- Recommendations: Remove hardcoded secrets, use secure environment management, and avoid sys.path modifications for better security.",
