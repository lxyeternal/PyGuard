  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements in a package's __init__.py or similar module.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, network activity, or external data handling is mentioned.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n**Scores consistency:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0, with one at 0.1), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the clear and simple code.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- Since the code is purely import statements, there's little room for malware or obfuscation. The reports seem thorough and accurate.\n- No report claims any suspicious behavior or assumptions that could be challenged.\n- The only minor point is the report with a security risk score of 0.1; given the benign nature, even that seems slightly high but still acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes needed; the reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, given the lack of any security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify this code as benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The scoring aligns well with the analysis.",
