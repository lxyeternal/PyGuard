  "purpose": "Import statements for various modules and components within a Python package, likely setting up module exports and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Module import statements at the top of the file.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; this file only imports components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic execution or suspicious code constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes and variables from internal modules. No data processing, network activity, or code execution occurs here. The structure appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py or similar initialization file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors. The simplicity of the code and the context suggest it's just defining package exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of import statements used for module initialization. It shows no evidence of malicious activity, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and standard for a Python package's internal structure.",
