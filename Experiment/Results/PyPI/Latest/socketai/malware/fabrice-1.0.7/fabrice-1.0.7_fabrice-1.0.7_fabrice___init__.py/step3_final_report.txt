{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package's initialization file, importing internal modules and classes to expose API components.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules (_version, connection, runners, group, tasks, executor).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static imports do not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "N/A – only static imports; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of straightforward import statements with no dynamic or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py file, importing various internal modules and classes for API exposure. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is static, with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic execution. The minimal security risk and malware scores are appropriate; the security risk score in the original reports (0.1) is slightly overestimated given the benign nature of the code. Overall, the code is safe and typical for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module initialization file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All previous assessments are accurate; the only adjustment is setting the security risk score to 0, reflecting the lack of any security concern.",
