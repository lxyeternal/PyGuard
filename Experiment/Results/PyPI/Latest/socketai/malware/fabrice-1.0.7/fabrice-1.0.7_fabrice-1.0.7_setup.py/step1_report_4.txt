{
  "purpose": "This script configures and sets up a Python package named 'fabrice' with optional dependencies, package discovery, and entry points for CLI commands.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', reading the filesystem for directories 'fabric' and 'fabric2', reading the '_version.py' file, reading 'README.rst' file, and static package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Executing 'exec' on the contents of '_version.py', reading 'README.rst', and calling 'setuptools.setup()' with provided parameters. No untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks in a way that would cause vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2' influences package naming; filesystem checks determine which package name to use; reading '_version.py' defines 'version'; reading 'README.rst' contributes to 'long_description'; all data ultimately feeds into 'setuptools.setup()' for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Use of 'exec' on '_version.py' is standard for version retrieval, assuming the file is trusted. No external network access or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment checks and filesystem validations to determine package configuration dynamically. It reads version info from a local file and description from a README file. All operations are standard for package setup scripts. The use of 'exec' is typical for importing version info without module import. No signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code appears to be a normal, legitimate setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on local files and environment variables for configuration, which is common. No malicious code or sabotage detected.",
