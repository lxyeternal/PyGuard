  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python project, configuring dependencies, version info, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', filesystem checks for 'fabric' and 'fabric2' directories, reading '_version.py', README file for long description.",
  "sinks": "Execution of '_version.py' via exec(), which could execute malicious code if the file is compromised.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks determine package name and binary; reading '_version.py' executes code; reading README provides long description; setup configuration uses these values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to read '_version.py' without validation; no other anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging, with environment and filesystem checks, and reads version info via exec(). The exec() pattern is common but risky if the '_version.py' file is compromised. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate. The main concern is the exec() call, which could be replaced with safer alternatives, but in controlled environments, it is acceptable. Overall, the code is legitimate, with a minor security concern regarding executing a local version file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with a minor security concern due to exec() usage. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain attack. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
