  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the script as a standard Python package setup script.\n- The primary concern across all reports is the use of `exec()` to read `_version.py`.\n- No reports identify malicious code, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious external activity.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly above 0.8), indicating the reviewers are quite certain about their assessments.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- Security risks are low (around 0.1–0.2), primarily due to the use of `exec()`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Use of `exec()` to execute `_version.py`**: While common in some setup scripts, executing code from a file without validation can be risky if the file is compromised. However, in typical controlled environments, this is considered acceptable.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **No significant logical errors or malicious code** are present.\n- The reports correctly identify the `exec()` usage as a potential risk but acknowledge it is standard practice.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score (0)**: No evidence of malicious activity or malware.\n- **Obfuscated score (0)**: No obfuscated code detected.\n- **Risk score (~0.1–0.2)**: Justified due to the `exec()` usage, which could be exploited if the `_version.py` file is tampered with.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The `exec()` usage should be replaced with safer alternatives, such as importing the version as a module or reading the version string directly, to mitigate potential risks.\n- No changes needed for the malware score; it is accurate.\n- The risk score could be slightly increased to reflect the potential danger of executing untrusted code, but given the context, the current score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to `exec()` usage, which is a known risk but standard in many setup scripts)\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions that the script is a typical setup script with a minor security concern in the form of executing a version file via `exec()`. No evidence suggests any supply chain attack or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** While the code appears legitimate, the use of `exec()` should be addressed to improve security, such as by importing the version or reading it as a string.",
