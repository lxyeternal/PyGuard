{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'fabrice' or 'fabrice2', configuring dependencies, entry points, and package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', filesystem directories ('fabric2', 'fabric'), and the '_version.py' file within the package.",
  "sinks": "Reading 'README.rst' content, executing the '_version.py' file, and passing configuration to setuptools.setup(), which influences package installation.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences package name and binary. Directory presence check also affects these variables. The content of '_version.py' is executed to obtain version info, and 'README.rst' content is read for description. All these data flow into the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of 'exec' to run '_version.py' can be risky if the file content is malicious, but this is a common practice for version reading. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or suspicious external network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment and filesystem checks to determine package configuration. It reads the version info by executing a local '_version.py' file, which is a typical approach in Python packaging. The 'long_description' is composed by reading 'README.rst'. The setup parameters specify dependencies and entry points, which are standard for packaging. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malware indicators are present. The use of 'exec' for version reading is a potential risk but is common in such scripts and not inherently malicious. No network activity, data leaks, or hidden behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It appropriately configures package details and dependencies without suspicious patterns.",
