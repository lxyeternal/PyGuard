{
  "purpose": "The script configures and sets up a Python package named 'fabrice' or 'fabrice2', including dependency management and entry point configuration for a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', file reading for version info ('_version.py'), reading 'README.rst' for long_description, and package discovery via 'setuptools.find_packages'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data; package setup configuration itself does not process untrusted input or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences package and binary naming; version info read from a file; setup parameters configured based on environment and directory structure.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to evaluate contents of '_version.py' could be risky if the file is maliciously modified, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup tasks, with environment-dependent configuration for package names and binaries. It reads version info from a file using 'exec', which, although potentially risky if the file is malicious, is a standard pattern. The script does not execute untrusted code or contain network calls, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. No suspicious data leaks or backdoors are present. The overall structure is typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The use of 'exec' for version reading warrants attention but is standard practice. No signs of malware or malicious intent detected.",
