  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, controlled test suite with no malicious behavior or supply chain threats. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 to 0.2, justified by the use of a hardcoded sudo password in a testing context. Overall, it poses minimal security risk and is safe for use in testing environments."
