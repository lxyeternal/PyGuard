  "raw_response": "{\n  \"purpose\": \"The code appears to be a set of tests and utility functions for verifying the behavior of the 'invoke' and 'fabric' libraries, particularly related to SSH connections, command execution, and timeouts.\",\n  \"sources\": \"Environment variable 'TRAVIS' for skipping tests, localhost hostname for SSH connections, and command inputs such as 'echo foo', 'stty size', and 'sleep'.\",\n  \"sinks\": \"Execution of shell commands via 'run' and 'local', and SSH connection management which could potentially be misused if inputs are malicious (though no user input is directly used in commands).\",\n  \"flows\": \"The code reads environment variables and executes commands directly with fixed strings, mainly 'echo foo' and 'sleep'. No flow involves untrusted user input; the commands are hardcoded in the tests.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"There are no hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code includes a 'sudo' test assuming a configured password, but it is a test environment, not malicious. The use of 'os.environ[\"LOGNAME\"]' is standard but could be exploited if environment is manipulated, but in context, it’s part of testing.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code primarily tests SSH connection handling, command execution, and timeout behaviors within a testing framework. There is no indication of obfuscated code or malicious logic. It uses standard library functions, and no data exfiltration, system damage, or backdoors are present. The use of 'sudo' with a hardcoded password is part of test setup, not malicious intent. No external data flows or untrusted inputs are processed in a dangerous way. Overall, the code does not contain any malicious behavior, and its purpose is limited to testing functionalities of SSH and command execution libraries.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a safe test suite for SSH and command execution libraries with no malicious intent or malicious code detected. It follows standard testing practices and does not exhibit malware characteristics or security risks.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.1\n}",
