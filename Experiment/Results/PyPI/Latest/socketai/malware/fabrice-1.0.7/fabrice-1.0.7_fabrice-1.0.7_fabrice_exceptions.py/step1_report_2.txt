{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling within a Python application, likely related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "Exception class constructors and the class definitions themselves.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily class and exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be straightforward class definitions with comments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings, indicating intended use for error handling in task grouping and environment validation. No input/output handling, network operations, or data processing occurs. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or suspicious activity is evident. The comments suggest possible future refactoring but do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is simple, clean, and consistent with standard Python practices for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with no suspicious or malicious elements. It appears to be a benign part of a larger application. No security risks or malware behaviors are identified.",
