{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for specific error handling scenarios related to task execution and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code defines classes and constructor methods only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; classes are used for exception handling without data processing or transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with no data processing, external calls, or potentially malicious logic. No input reading, data leaks, or external communications are present. The exception classes are straightforward and do not perform any complex operations or contain obfuscated code. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for error handling within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely definitional, establishing custom exceptions without any malicious intent or security risks. It poses no threat and is standard for exception handling in Python projects.",
