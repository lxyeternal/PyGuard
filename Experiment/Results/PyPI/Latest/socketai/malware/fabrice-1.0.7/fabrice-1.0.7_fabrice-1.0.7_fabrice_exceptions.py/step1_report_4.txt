{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios in a larger application, such as 'NothingToDo', 'GroupException', and 'InvalidV1Env'.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only defines classes and exception handling structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the classes are used for exception handling within other parts of an application.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class definitions for custom exceptions, which is a standard pattern for error handling. There are no functions, data inputs, or external calls. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior. It appears to be a typical part of a larger codebase dedicated to managing exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign definition of custom exceptions with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides structured error handling mechanisms.",
