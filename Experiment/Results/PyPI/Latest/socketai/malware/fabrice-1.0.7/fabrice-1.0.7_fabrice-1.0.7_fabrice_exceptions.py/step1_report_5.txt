  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling and future use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; exception classes are static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; exceptions are not triggered within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three custom exception class definitions, with no dynamic execution, data handling, or external calls. It serves as a structural part of a larger codebase, likely to handle specific error cases related to task execution and environment validation. No malware indicators, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for defining custom exceptions. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security vulnerabilities.",
