{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in a Python project, specifically for handling errors related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their constructors; no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code primarily defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The comment at the top is unrelated to the class definitions and appears to be a placeholder or note.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class definitions for custom exceptions, which are standard and do not perform any operations or contain logic that could be malicious. No input, environment variables, or external data handling present. No suspicious or malicious patterns observed. The comment at the top is just a note, not executable code. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of error handling within a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent, no security risks, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
