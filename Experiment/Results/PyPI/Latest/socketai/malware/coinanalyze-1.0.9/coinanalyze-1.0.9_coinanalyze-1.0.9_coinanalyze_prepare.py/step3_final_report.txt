  "anomalies": [
    "Heavy use of base64 encoding to obfuscate code",
    "Dynamic execution with `exec()` on decoded data",
    "Encoded URLs and key-value pairs suggesting network activity",
    "Multiple imports that are unused or irrelevant"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code decodes two base64-encoded strings, concatenates the decoded data, and executes it with `exec()`. The obfuscation via base64 encoding and the use of `exec()` on the decoded payload are classic indicators of malicious intent, often used to conceal malicious commands or payloads. The embedded URLs and key-value pairs suggest potential for remote command-and-control or data exfiltration. The code does not perform any benign operations; its structure and behavior align with typical malware obfuscation techniques. The heavy obfuscation, combined with dynamic code execution, indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity. The code's purpose appears to be to hide and run malicious payloads, making it highly suspicious and dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious due to its obfuscation, dynamic execution, and embedded network indicators. It should be treated as malicious, with high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The pattern of decoding and executing hidden code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, warranting caution and further analysis or avoidance.",
