{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata and dependencies for the 'coinanalyze' Python package to facilitate distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Static source code defining package setup parameters; no external data input or user data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no code execution or data leakage mechanisms identified.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration code, no runtime data flow or input-output flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. No external input sources, no code injection, or dynamic execution present. The dependencies specified ('blessings ~= 1.7' and 'pytest>=3.2') are common testing and utility packages, with no indication of malicious intent. The license is set as 'Python Script', which is unconventional but not malicious. Overall, the script appears typical for Python package distribution, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
