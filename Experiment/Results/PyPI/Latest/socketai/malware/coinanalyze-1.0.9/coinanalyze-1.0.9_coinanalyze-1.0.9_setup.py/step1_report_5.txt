  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'coinanalyze' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata and dependencies; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external output functions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the code only sets package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior are present. The license string 'Python Script' is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to configure package details and dependencies. No obfuscated code, malicious functions, or suspicious patterns are present. The dependencies specified are common, and there is no indication of malicious behavior. The license field is atypical but not inherently malicious. No input/output operations or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a normal, benign package setup script.",
