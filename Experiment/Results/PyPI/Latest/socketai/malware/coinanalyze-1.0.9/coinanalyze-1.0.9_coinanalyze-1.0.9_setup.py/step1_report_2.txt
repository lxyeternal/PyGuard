{
  "purpose": "Define the package setup configuration for the 'coinanalyze' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata for package name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable usage are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the setup configuration is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is a standard setup script with normal use of setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls the 'setup' function with static arguments defining package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or secret handling occurs. The dependencies are standard; no hardcoded credentials or unusual code structures are present. The license string 'Python Script' is unconventional but not malicious. Overall, the script appears to be a standard, benign package setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no external inputs, secret handling, or suspicious code patterns.",
