  "purpose": "Define the package metadata and dependencies for the 'coinanalyze' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data for package configuration and dependency requirements; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or user input is processed; no data leakage or insecure data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The license field is set to 'Python Script', which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package details, including name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies. The dependencies are standard, with a version specifier '~= 1.7' for 'blessings', and an optional development dependency. No input/output operations, network activity, or code execution beyond package metadata are present. The code appears to be a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely specifies package metadata and dependencies without processing external data or executing any suspicious operations.",
