  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the 'coinanalyze' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, such as name, version, description, author, license, dependencies, and extras.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input sources are used.",
  "flows": "None; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional license string 'Python Script' but not malicious; no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools, containing only static metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or secrets are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
