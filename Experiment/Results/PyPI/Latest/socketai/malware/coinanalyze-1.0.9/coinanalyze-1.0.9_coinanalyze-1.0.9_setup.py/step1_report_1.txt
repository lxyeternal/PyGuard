  "purpose": "Define and configure the package 'coinanalyze' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Code reads hardcoded strings for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; static configuration data flows into setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected. The license 'Python Script' is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script specifying package metadata, dependencies, and extras. It does not include any code execution, user input handling, or dynamic behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The dependencies are normal and benign. The license string is atypical but not malicious. Overall, the script appears to be a straightforward package configuration without suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply prepares the package for distribution.",
