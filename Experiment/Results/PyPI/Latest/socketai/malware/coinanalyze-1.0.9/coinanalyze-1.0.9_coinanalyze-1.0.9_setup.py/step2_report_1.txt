  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the code to ensure the scores are appropriate and consistent with the findings.\n\n**Overall code review:**\n- The code is a standard `setuptools` setup script.\n- It contains only static package metadata, dependencies, and optional extras.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network operations, or data handling.\n- The license string \"Python Script\" is unconventional but not malicious.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code detected.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review per report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes the static configuration.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data or data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; license string is unconventional but benign.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; straightforward setup script.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risks.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `risk=0`.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static data, no external input.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; license string is unconventional but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static configuration.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; license string unconventional but benign.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward setup script.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or security issues.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static data.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; license string unconventional but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Standard setup script.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static strings.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; license string unconventional but benign.\n- **Analysis:** Typical setup script.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final considerations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign `0`. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign `0`, which is justified given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores across all reports are appropriate.",
