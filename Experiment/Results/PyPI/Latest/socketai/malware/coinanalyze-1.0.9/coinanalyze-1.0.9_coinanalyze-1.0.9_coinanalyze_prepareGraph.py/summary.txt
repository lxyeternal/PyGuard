  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and performs data embedding for visualization. The primary security concern is the lack of sanitization of 'json_dump', which could lead to code injection if 'json_dump' is controlled by an attacker. No malware or obfuscation is present. The current scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the risk score should be maintained around 0.2-0.3 to reflect the injection potential."
