  "purpose": "Download and set up the Quark library for graph visualization if not already present.",
  "sources": "os.listdir(), os.getcwd(), user environment, external git repository",
  "sinks": "os.system() calls executing shell commands, file manipulations (mv, remove)",
  "flows": "Checks for 'quark.html' in current directory -> clones GitHub repo -> moves files -> deletes temporary files",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with string concatenation for executing shell commands; no validation or sanitization of environment variables or inputs; potential risk if environment variables are manipulated externally",
  "analysis": "The code verifies the presence of 'quark.html' in the current directory. If absent, it prints status messages, then clones a GitHub repository containing Quark via 'git clone' executed through os.system(). It then moves specific files from the cloned repo to the current directory and deletes the temporary cloned repository folder. The use of os.system() with string concatenation introduces potential command injection risk if environment variables or directory names are manipulated. However, given that the commands use controlled directory paths and no user input, this is unlikely to be malicious but still poses a security consideration. There are no obvious backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code; the script's purpose appears to be legitimate installation automation.",
  "conclusion": "The code automates the download and setup of an external library using shell commands, with no evident malicious intent. The main security concern is the reliance on os.system() with string concatenation, which could be risky if external factors influence the environment. Overall, the script's behavior is consistent with legitimate setup procedures, with minimal security risks.",
