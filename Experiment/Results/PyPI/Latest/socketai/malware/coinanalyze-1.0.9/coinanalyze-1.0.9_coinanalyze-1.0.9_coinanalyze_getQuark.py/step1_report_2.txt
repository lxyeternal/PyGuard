{
  "purpose": "The code checks for the presence of 'quark.html' in the current directory and, if absent, clones a GitHub repository to download necessary resources for viewing graphs, then moves and cleans up files.",
  "sources": "os.listdir(), os.getcwd(), user environment via os.system commands, and the local filesystem",
  "sinks": "os.system() calls executing 'git clone' and 'mv', filesystem modifications via shutil.rmtree and os.remove",
  "flows": "Check for 'quark.html' -> clone repository -> move files -> delete repository files",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() to execute shell commands for cloning and moving files, which can be exploited if inputs are manipulated, but here commands are static. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs filesystem checks and, if necessary, clones a public GitHub repository to obtain 'Quark' resources. It then moves specific files to the current directory and deletes the cloned repository folder. The commands are static and directly related to installing required resources. No malicious code, such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors, is present. The code's behavior appears to be for legitimate setup purposes but uses system commands insecurely. No suspicious data flows or anomalies detected beyond the use of os.system().",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for downloading and installing resources, with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. The use of os.system() for executing static commands is typical for such scripts, though it could be improved for security. Overall, the code appears benign.",
