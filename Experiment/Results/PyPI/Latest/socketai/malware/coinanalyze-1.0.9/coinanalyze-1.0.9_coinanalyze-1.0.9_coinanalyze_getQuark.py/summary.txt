  "conclusion": "The script is a standard dependency setup routine that downloads and installs a dependency from a public repository if not already present. While it employs insecure practices like executing shell commands without verification, it does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors. The main concern is the reliance on external code, which could be compromised, but in its current form, it is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.3. Implementing checksum verification and using safer subprocess methods would enhance security."
