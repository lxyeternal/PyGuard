  "purpose": "To ensure the necessary Quark repository is cloned and set up for visualizing graphs generated by Orbit.",
  "sources": "os.listdir(), os.getcwd(), os.system(), shutil.rmtree, os.remove",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing 'git clone' and 'mv' commands, file removal with os.remove and shutil.rmtree",
  "flows": "Code checks for 'quark.html' in current directory -> If absent, retrieves current directory -> Executes system commands to clone repository and move files -> Cleans up temporary files",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system for cloning and moving files; potentially unsafe if inputs are manipulated, but in this context, inputs are fixed. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The script checks if 'quark.html' exists; if not, it clones a GitHub repository 's0md3v/Quark' into a subdirectory, moves necessary files to current directory, removes the repository and its README. Uses system commands for cloning and file operations, which could be risky if inputs are compromised, but here they are static. No malicious behaviors like data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code are evident. The operations are typical setup procedures for dependency installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a setup task to download and prepare Quark for graph visualization, with no malicious intent detected. It relies on static commands and normal file operations, without malicious code or suspicious network activity.",
