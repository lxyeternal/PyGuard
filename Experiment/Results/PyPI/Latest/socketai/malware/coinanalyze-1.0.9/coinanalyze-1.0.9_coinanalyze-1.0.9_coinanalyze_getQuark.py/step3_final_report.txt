  "purpose": "Ensure the presence of 'quark.html' by cloning a remote GitHub repository if missing, to facilitate graph visualization in the larger project.",
  "sources": "Filesystem checks with os.listdir() and os.getcwd(); remote repository cloning via os.system('git clone ...'); file moves with os.system('mv ...'); cleanup with shutil.rmtree() and os.remove().",
  "sinks": "Execution of shell commands ('git clone', 'mv', 'rm') via os.system(), filesystem modifications, and directory manipulations.",
  "flows": "Check for 'quark.html' -> clone repository if absent -> move files into current directory -> delete cloned repository folder.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with static commands; no input validation or verification of downloaded content; reliance on external repository without integrity checks; no malicious payloads or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward setup routine: it verifies if 'quark.html' exists, and if not, clones a public GitHub repository, moves relevant files into the current directory, and cleans up the cloned repository. It uses os.system() with fixed commands, which poses a security concern if environment variables or directory names are manipulated, but in typical controlled environments, this is standard. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The primary risk stems from executing remote code without verification, which could be exploited if the repository is compromised. The code is clear and not obfuscated. The malware score is justified as 0, as no malicious activity is detected. The security risk score is moderate (around 0.3), reflecting the potential danger of remote code download and execution without verification. Overall, this is a typical setup script with moderate security considerations, and no immediate malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard dependency setup routine that downloads and installs a dependency from a public repository if not already present. While it employs insecure practices like executing shell commands without verification, it does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors. The main concern is the reliance on external code, which could be compromised, but in its current form, it is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.3. Implementing checksum verification and using safer subprocess methods would enhance security.",
