  "purpose": "Monitor Bitcoin wallets for balance changes and transactions, log updates, and alert via print and sound notifications.",
  "sources": "API responses from blockchain.info for each wallet; reading wallet data from input list; reading and writing to log file.",
  "sinks": "Logging to file; printing alerts; playing sound notifications; updating wallet data in memory.",
  "flows": "API response data -> balance and transaction processing -> logging/printing/sound alerts -> updating wallet state.",
  "anomalies": "Unused 'requester' function that concatenates URLs unsafely; missing imports ('time', 'datetime', 'winsound'); undefined variables ('GREEN', 'RED', 'ENDC'); re-initialization of 'processed_transactions' each loop; infinite loop without exit condition.",
  "analysis": "The code monitors specified wallets by querying blockchain.info API, detects balance and transaction changes, logs details, and plays a sound upon detection. It uses a set to track processed transactions but re-initializes it each cycle, reducing effectiveness. Missing imports and undefined variables would cause runtime errors. The 'requester' function is unused and concatenates URLs insecurely. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The main issues are implementation flaws rather than security concerns. The code's purpose is legitimate, and no evidence of sabotage or malware exists.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward wallet monitoring tool with no malicious intent. Implementation flaws are present but do not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minor operational issues. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use with recommended fixes for robustness.",
