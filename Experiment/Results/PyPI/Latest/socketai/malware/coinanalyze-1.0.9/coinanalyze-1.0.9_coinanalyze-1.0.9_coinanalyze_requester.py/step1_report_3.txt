{
  "purpose": "The code monitors specified cryptocurrency wallets for balance changes and new transactions, logging events and playing a sound alert.",
  "sources": "The code reads wallet data from a list of dictionaries, user input is not directly read; it fetches data from external URLs using requests.get.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to a file, printed to console, and sound is played via winsound; external URL requests and file operations are potential data sinks.",
  "flows": "Wallet data is fetched from blockchain.info, processed for balance and transaction updates, and logged; no untrusted data flow identified outside external requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of infinite loop without exit conditions, unprotected file writes, and external sound file playback are operational concerns but not malicious anomalies. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script periodically fetches wallet information from blockchain.info, checks for balance changes and new transactions, logs details, and plays sounds on new transactions. It maintains a set of processed transactions to avoid duplicates. The code structure is straightforward; no obfuscated or malicious code patterns are evident. External URL requests are made securely to a known API, and data is handled locally. No suspicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a wallet monitoring tool without any evident malicious intent or malicious code. It performs expected operations such as data retrieval, logging, and alerting. No malware or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
