Use of string concatenation for XML generation is standard but could be insecure if input data is maliciously crafted; no external data sources or network operations observed.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The function checks filename extension to determine output format. If the filename ends with '.graphml', it constructs an XML string representing the graph, iterating over nodes and edges, converting sizes to float, and stripping 'id=' prefixes from source and target. If not, it returns formatted JSON data. The code does not execute any external commands, write to files, or perform network operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The use of string formatting could pose XML injection risks if inputs are malicious, but this is typical for such serialization functions and not inherently malicious.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a straightforward data serialization function transforming JSON into GraphML format or returning JSON data. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain risks. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.1\n}",
