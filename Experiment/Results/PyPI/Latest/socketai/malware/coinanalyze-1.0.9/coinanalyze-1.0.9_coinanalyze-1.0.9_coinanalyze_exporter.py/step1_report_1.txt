{
  "purpose": "The function exports data in GraphML format if the filename ends with '.graphml'; otherwise, it returns a JSON string of the input data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'filename' parameter to determine output format, and from the 'jsoned' parameter, which contains 'nodes' and 'edges' data.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs either a GraphML string or a JSON string. No external data sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Input data ('jsoned') flows into string formatting operations to generate output; no untrusted data flows into insecure sinks such as network or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs straightforward data formatting. It uses string interpolation with data from 'jsoned' without sanitization, but this is typical for formatting; no security risk stems from this unless malicious data is injected.",
  "analysis": "The function checks the filename extension to determine the output format. If it ends with '.graphml', it constructs an XML string representing graph data, iterating over nodes and edges. During iteration, it converts node sizes and edge weights to floats, which is standard. It strips 'id=' prefixes from source and target attributes, assuming these are string identifiers. If the filename does not end with '.graphml', it returns a JSON dump of the input data. No untrusted data is sent to external systems, nor does the code execute any system commands or network operations. The code appears safe and functional for its intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data formatting function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes input data to produce GraphML or JSON output as specified, without performing unsafe operations or leaking data.",
