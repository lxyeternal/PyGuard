  "purpose": "Convert a JSON object containing nodes and edges into GraphML format if filename ends with '.graphml', otherwise pretty-print JSON.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'filename' and 'jsoned' (JSON data structure with nodes and edges)",
  "sinks": "Data formatting and string concatenation for GraphML output, JSON serialization",
  "flows": "Input data is processed and formatted into GraphML string or JSON output depending on filename extension",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code, and no unusual data handling observed",
  "analysis": "The function checks the filename extension. If it ends with '.graphml', it constructs an XML string representing GraphML, iterating over 'nodes' and 'edges' to build XML elements with data. It uses string formatting with values from 'jsoned' without sanitization, but this appears to be for structured data formatting, not malicious intent. If the filename does not end with '.graphml', it returns a pretty-printed JSON string. There are no indications of data leakage, external calls, or malicious behavior. The code only manipulates data locally for formatting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data formatting utility with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain threats. It simply converts JSON to GraphML or pretty-prints JSON, with no suspicious activity.",
