  "purpose": "Convert JSON data into GraphML format if filename ends with '.graphml'; otherwise, return pretty-printed JSON.",
  "sources": "The 'filename' parameter for extension check; 'jsoned' data structure for nodes and edges.",
  "sinks": "None; no external sinks or data leaks; data is serialized locally.",
  "flows": "Input filename extension determines output format; 'jsoned' data is used directly for serialization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string interpolation without sanitization could lead to malformed XML if 'jsoned' contains malicious data, but no active malicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data serialization, converting a JSON-like structure into GraphML XML or JSON string based on filename extension. No external system calls, network activity, or code execution are involved. The only potential concern is lack of input sanitization, which could cause malformed XML or injection if malicious data is supplied. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The code's logic is simple and clear, with scores reflecting minimal security risk. The main issue is the absence of validation, but this does not constitute malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard data formatter with no malware or malicious behavior. The slight security concern relates to potential injection or malformed output due to unsanitized input, but this does not indicate active malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
