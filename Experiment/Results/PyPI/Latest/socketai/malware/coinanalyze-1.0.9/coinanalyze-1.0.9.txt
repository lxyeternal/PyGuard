      "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and performs data embedding for visualization. The primary security concern is the lack of sanitization of 'json_dump', which could lead to code injection if 'json_dump' is controlled by an attacker. No malware or obfuscation is present. The current scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the risk score should be maintained around 0.2-0.3 to reflect the injection potential."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious due to its obfuscation, dynamic execution, and embedded network indicators. It should be treated as malicious, with high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The pattern of decoding and executing hidden code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, warranting caution and further analysis or avoidance."

The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minor operational issues. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use with recommended fixes for robustness."

It should be classified as highly malicious with a high security risk. The behavior aligns with malware or backdoor functionalities, warranting caution and further static or dynamic analysis."

      "conclusion": "The script is a standard dependency setup routine that downloads and installs a dependency from a public repository if not already present. While it employs insecure practices like executing shell commands without verification, it does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors. The main concern is the reliance on external code, which could be compromised, but in its current form, it is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.3. Implementing checksum verification and using safer subprocess methods would enhance security."
