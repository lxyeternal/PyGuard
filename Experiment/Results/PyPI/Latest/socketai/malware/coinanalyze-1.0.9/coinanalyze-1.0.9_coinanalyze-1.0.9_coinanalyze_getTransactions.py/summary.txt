  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of utility functions for blockchain data retrieval, database management, and testing mocks. No malicious or obfuscated code is detected. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The risk score can be set around 0.1 to reflect the testing complexity but does not indicate any security threat."
