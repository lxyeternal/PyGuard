  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions for blockchain data retrieval, database management, and testing. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.\n- **Findings:** The code interacts with blockchain nodes, external APIs, and databases in a standard way. No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code appears benign and standard for such applications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on data fetching, database, and mocking. No malicious activity, but notes the extensive mocking and complex transaction management.\n- **Findings:** External API responses are stored locally, database interactions are standard, no backdoors or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2. Slightly higher risk due to complexity but still benign.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The small risk score reflects the complexity but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on blockchain data fetching, API calls, and mocking. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Findings:** External API URL is legitimate, data is stored locally, no obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with emphasis on data flow and testing setup. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** External mempool API, data stored locally, standard mocking.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasoning is sound; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same general conclusion—functions for blockchain data, database, and testing, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code contains no suspicious or malicious patterns. No network activity, no code injection, no data exfiltration, no obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which matches the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied but all low (0.1-0.2). The code is standard for blockchain data processing and testing, with no evident security risks.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** Given the code's nature, I would assign a **0.1** score, reflecting minimal inherent risk, primarily due to external API calls and database interactions, but nothing suspicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The collective analysis confirms the code is benign, standard, and free from malware or obfuscation. The low risk score of 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reasoning above.",
