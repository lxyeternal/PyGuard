  "purpose": "Static configuration constants for URI schemes, regex patterns, backend URLs, gateways, API endpoints, and supported blockchain network IDs.",
  "sources": "Definitions of URI schemes, regex patterns, backend URL strings, gateway URLs, API authority string, and supported chain ID mappings.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; all values are static constants with no dynamic data or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code contains straightforward static constants with clear, standard values. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static configuration constants defining URL schemes, regex patterns, backend endpoints, gateways, API authorities, and supported chain IDs. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic behaviors. The values are hardcoded and serve as configuration parameters. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the benign, static nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward static configuration and absence of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
