{
  "purpose": "Define configuration constants and patterns related to Ethereum registry schemes, IPFS backend, gateways, GitHub API, and supported chain IDs.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments, regex pattern definition, tuple and dictionary declarations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows from untrusted sources or user input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; static constants used internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes configuration constants and patterns for use in a larger system. The schemes, regex, URLs, and supported chain IDs are hardcoded static values. No input handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, setting configuration constants and patterns without any malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be a legitimate setup module with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
