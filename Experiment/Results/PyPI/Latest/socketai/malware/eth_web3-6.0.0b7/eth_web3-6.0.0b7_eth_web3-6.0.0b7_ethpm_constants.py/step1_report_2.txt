  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters for blockchain and IPFS interactions in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned with static string or numeric values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks as the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a set of constants and configuration parameters such as URI schemes, regex patterns, backend URLs, IPFS gateways, and supported blockchain network IDs. All values are static, hardcoded strings or numbers. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no network communication within this snippet. The constants appear relevant and standard for blockchain and IPFS integrations. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, credential theft, or data leakage, are evident. The code does not contain obfuscation, malware indicators, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a configuration setup with static parameters for blockchain and IPFS services. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious patterns, or security risks identified. The code appears benign and intended for legitimate purposes.",
