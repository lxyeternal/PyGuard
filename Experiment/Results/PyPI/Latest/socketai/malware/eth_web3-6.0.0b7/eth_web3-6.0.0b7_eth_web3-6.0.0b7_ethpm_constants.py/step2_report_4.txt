  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the scoring, and the reasoning provided.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static configuration constants.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, or network communication is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The regex, URLs, and IDs are standard and relevant for blockchain/IPFS configurations.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states that the code is a static configuration module with no malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The score and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly identifies the code as static constants with no malicious intent.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; static configuration with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Score justification:** Zero malware, no security risks.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes that the code is configuration data without malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** All scores at zero are justified.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states the code is purely definitional, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Zero malware, no obfuscation, no security risk.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports are consistent and reasonable in their assessments.\n- The malware scores are all correctly set to 0.\n- The security risk scores are also appropriately zero, given the static nature of the code.\n- The reasoning in each report is thorough and justified.\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- The code is a straightforward configuration module.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns well with the code's content. No further action or concern is necessary based on this analysis.",
