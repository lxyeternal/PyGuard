{
  "purpose": "Define configuration constants and regex patterns related to blockchain registry schemes, IPFS backend, gateways, GitHub API, and supported Ethereum network IDs.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions and string assignments; no external input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external communication within this code segment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code only sets static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains static constant definitions for schemes, regex patterns, URLs, API authority, and network IDs. There are no functions, no input processing, no external data handling, or runtime logic that could be exploited or indicate malicious behavior. The constants appear to serve as configuration parameters for a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a straightforward configuration setup with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. It is safe based on this segment alone.",
