  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify their claims with the provided code snippet.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of static constants: URL schemes, regex patterns, backend URLs, API endpoints, and a dictionary of supported chain IDs.\n- No functions, data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are evident.\n- The code appears to serve as configuration parameters for a larger application.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** No issues; code is static configuration with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; static constants with no data flow or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; purely static configuration, no dynamic code or external communication.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Static configuration with no malicious indicators.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, static constants with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is static configuration data with no malicious or suspicious content.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Potential for higher risk scores?**  \n  No. Given the code's nature, a higher risk score isn't justified.\n\n- **Malware concern?**  \n  None. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  No assumptions are made; the analysis is based on static code review.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert opinion:**\n\nBased on the provided code snippet and the detailed reports, **all assessments are accurate**. The code is a benign configuration module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the reports correctly reflect that.",
