{
  "purpose": "Define constants and configurations related to registry schemes, package naming, IPFS backend, gateways, and supported blockchain network IDs.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, regex patterns, string literals, and dictionary for supported chain IDs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only establishes static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns are present. The regex appears straightforward, and all constants seem to serve configuration purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines static configuration variables, including URI schemes, regex for package names, IPFS backend and gateway URLs, GitHub API authority, and a dictionary mapping chain IDs to network names. There are no data inputs, no processing of untrusted data, and no dynamic or obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials, no network connections initiated, and no sensitive information is exposed. Overall, the code appears to be standard configuration setup with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely configuration data without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any code that could be exploited or that performs harmful operations.",
