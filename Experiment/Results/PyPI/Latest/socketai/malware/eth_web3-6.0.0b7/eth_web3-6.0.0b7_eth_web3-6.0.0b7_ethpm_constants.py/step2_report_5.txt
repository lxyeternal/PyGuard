  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code content, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code snippets are purely static configuration constants.\n- No functions, dynamic code, network calls, or data handling are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n- The regex, URLs, and IDs are standard and relevant for blockchain/IPFS configurations.\n- No obfuscation or malicious payloads are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies that the code is static configuration with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizes static constants, no input handling, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The analysis is thorough.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, confirms static constants, no external communication or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** all zeroes, which are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, no dynamic code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** all zeroes, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same, static configuration, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** all zeroes, fitting.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static configuration data.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and aligns with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Correctly 0; no security risks identified.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- If future code snippets introduce dynamic code, network activity, or secrets, re-evaluation would be necessary.\n- For this static configuration code, the current scores and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and justified. The code is benign configuration data with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is thorough. No adjustments are needed.",
