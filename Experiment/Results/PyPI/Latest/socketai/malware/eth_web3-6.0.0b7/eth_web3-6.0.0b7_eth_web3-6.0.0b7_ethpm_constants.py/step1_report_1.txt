  "purpose": "Define constants and configurations related to registry schemes, IPFS backends, gateways, GitHub API, and supported blockchain networks.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, string assignments, and a dictionary for supported chain IDs.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data input or output mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; all are static configuration values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual patterns detected. No obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains static configuration constants defining URL schemes, regex patterns, backend identifiers, API endpoints, and a supported networks dictionary. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or data handling logic. All values appear to serve configuration purposes and do not pose security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. It simply sets constants used elsewhere in an application.",
