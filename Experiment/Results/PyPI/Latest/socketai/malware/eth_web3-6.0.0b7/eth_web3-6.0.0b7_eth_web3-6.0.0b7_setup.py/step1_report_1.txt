  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python project, defining dependencies, package metadata, and installation instructions.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies, project metadata, and reading the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script does not process external untrusted input at runtime, only static data.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration data is used to configure the package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. All code appears standard for a setup.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools, with predefined dependencies and package info. It reads the README file for description, and configures the package build process. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The dependencies listed are typical for a web3-related project. The script's structure, imports, and data handling are consistent with common setup practices, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely manages package dependencies and metadata. Overall, it appears safe and standard.",
