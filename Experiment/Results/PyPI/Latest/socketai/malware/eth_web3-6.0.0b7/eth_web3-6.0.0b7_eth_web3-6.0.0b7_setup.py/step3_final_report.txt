{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, defining dependencies, metadata, and configuration for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, defining dependency lists, and static data within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or dynamic data processing; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md and defining static dependency lists; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; all code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script used for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file, defines dependencies, and calls setup() with static metadata. There are no dynamic executions, user inputs, network activity, or obfuscated code. Dependencies are typical for a web3 Ethereum Python package. The code does not contain any suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. All signals indicate a benign, well-structured package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk scores assigned in some reports are appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and standard nature.",
