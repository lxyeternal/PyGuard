  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring justification.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup.py script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** The code is static, with no dynamic execution or obfuscation. The dependencies are typical. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the standard nature of the setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1). The report states that dependencies are standard and no suspicious code is present. The minimal risk score seems to reflect the general risk associated with package dependencies rather than actual malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** No signs of malicious activity. The securityRisk score is perhaps slightly elevated but still reasonable given the context. No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Also confirms the script's benign nature, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** Clear reasoning; no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—benign setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** Slightly elevated securityRisk, but justified as the script is static and standard.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Confirms the script's standard, benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity; the script is straightforward.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with a couple of reports assigning 0.1. Given the code's static, benign nature, 0.1 might slightly overstate the risk but is acceptable as a conservative estimate for package setup scripts.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** I would assign **0** to reflect the benign nature of the script, as it is a standard setup.py file with no suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are appropriate, perhaps slightly conservative with the 0.1 risk scores in some cases. Overall, the code is safe, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and reasoning from all reports.",
