  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk scores assigned in some reports are appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and standard nature."
