  "purpose": "Manage and validate build dependencies for a package, providing access to dependency packages and validation functions.",
  "sources": "Input data from the 'build_dependencies' dictionary passed during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "Methods accessing 'build_dependencies' dictionary entries, mainly in 'get_dependency_package', 'items', 'values', and '_validate_name'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'build_dependencies' into methods that retrieve or validate dependencies; particularly in 'get_dependency_package' where a package name is validated and the package is retrieved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code appears to be straightforward dependency management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to manage package dependencies with standard dictionary operations, validation, and access methods. No untrusted data input, external network calls, or suspicious patterns are present. Usage of 'validate_package_name' is limited to input validation without executing or handling external code. All methods operate on the provided 'build_dependencies' dictionary, with no signs of malicious code or backdoors. The structure is typical for dependency management in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard dependency management utility with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It manages package dependencies safely without external or insecure operations.",
