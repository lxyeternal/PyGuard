  "flows": "validate_name_and_references called before accessing deployment_data or contract_instances",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility class for managing deployment data and contract instances, relying on external validation for contract names. It contains no network calls, dynamic code execution, or data leaks. The external validation function is assumed safe. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The logic is simple and clear, with proper validation steps before data access. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It functions as a standard data management utility with validation. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and low security risk scores. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and correctness.",
