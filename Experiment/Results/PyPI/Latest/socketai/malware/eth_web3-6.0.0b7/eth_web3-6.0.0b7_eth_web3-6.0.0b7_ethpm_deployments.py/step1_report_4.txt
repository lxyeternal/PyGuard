{
  "purpose": "Defines a Deployment class for accessing and managing deployed Ethereum contract data and instances.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are 'deployment_data' and 'contract_instances' provided during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; data is used internally for contract management.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'deployment_data' and 'contract_instances' into class methods that access or validate data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages and validates contract deployment data, with functions to retrieve contract info and ensure correct contract names. Validation is performed via 'validate_contract_name'. No code execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for managing Ethereum contract deployment data. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on external validation and data structures without performing any harmful operations.",
