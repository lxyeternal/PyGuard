{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for managing and accessing deployment data and contract instances in a blockchain context.",
  "sources": "Data sources include 'deployment_data' and 'contract_instances' dictionaries, which are passed during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The get_instance method retrieves contract instances based on user-provided contract_name; deployment_data and contract_instances are used internally without external input directly affecting critical operations.",
  "flows": "The flow involves validating a contract name and then accessing deployment data or contract instances based on the name, with no external untrusted input directly affecting these flows beyond method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to manage deployment data and contract instances with validation. It uses standard practices for data validation and dictionary access. No external data is used in a harmful way, and the logic appears straightforward. The only potential concern could be the use of external validate_contract_name, but without its implementation, no malicious behavior can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing blockchain deployment data with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity. It functions as expected for such a utility and does not contain malware or security risks.",
