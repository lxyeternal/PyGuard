  "purpose": "Define a Deployment class for managing and accessing deployed contract data and instances.",
  "sources": "Data input: deployment_data and contract_instances dictionaries, external validation via validate_contract_name.",
  "sinks": "Access to contract instances and deployment data; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data validation and access methods that retrieve deployment info and contract instances after name validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured access to deployment data and contract instances with proper validation. Usage of external validation function 'validate_contract_name' ensures correctness of contract names. No input/output or network operations are visible; no suspicious data leaks or malicious behaviors are present. The code relies on data passed during instantiation, with straightforward logic for data access and validation. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility class for managing deployed contract data. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
