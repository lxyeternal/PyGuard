  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the Py-EthPM project.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks, as there is no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow; these are class definitions for exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively consists of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from a base exception class. Each class is documented with a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no data inputs, external calls, or sensitive operations. The code structure is standard and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions used for error handling within a Python project. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
