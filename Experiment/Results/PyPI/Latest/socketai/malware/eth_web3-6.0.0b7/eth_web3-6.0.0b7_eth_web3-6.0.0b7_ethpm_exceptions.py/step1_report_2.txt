  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the Py-EthPM package.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading occurs in this code).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or untrusted data handling occurs in this code).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from sources to sinks since the code only defines exceptions).",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception. There are no data inputs, external calls, or potentially malicious constructs. It appears to be a standard pattern for error handling in Python projects, with clear and descriptive class names and docstrings. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or external dependencies are present. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simply defining custom exception classes for the Py-EthPM library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
