  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base class.\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are detected in the static code.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no data flow, external calls, or dynamic behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly state that the code is benign and purely structural.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are apparent.\n   - They correctly note the absence of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious constructs.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since all evidence points to benign, static class definitions with no dynamic or external behavior, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could compromise security.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the static nature of the code.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made without evidence.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the static, benign nature of the code, I concur with the provided assessments. No risks or malicious activity are evident.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard, straightforward set of custom exception classes.\n- No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malware are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. No changes are necessary.",
