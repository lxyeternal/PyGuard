{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for error handling in the PyEthPM project, serving as structural error markers without operational logic.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings; no data inputs, external calls, or dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "None; static class declarations with no data flow or runtime execution beyond class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, well-documented exception class definitions with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base error class. There are no data flows, external inputs, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The classes are simple, with descriptive docstrings and no logic beyond 'pass'. No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code serves as boilerplate for error handling, and the static nature indicates no malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign, structural purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and accurate.",
