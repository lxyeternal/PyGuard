  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, each inheriting from a base exception class (`PyEthPMError`).\n   - All classes contain descriptive docstrings and use `pass` as their body.\n   - There are no data flows, external inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or any other operational logic.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Potential Risks:**\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as a foundation for error handling.\n   - No malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation is evident.\n   - The exception classes are standard practice in Python projects to handle specific error conditions.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify the code as non-obfuscated (`0`).\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of `0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign a security risk of `0`, consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns?**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on static inspection.\n\n5. **Additional Justification for Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions with no operational logic, the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The risk score is also correctly low, as no security issues are introduced by defining exception classes.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk from static class definitions)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe provided code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the static, non-malicious nature of the code. No modifications are necessary.",
