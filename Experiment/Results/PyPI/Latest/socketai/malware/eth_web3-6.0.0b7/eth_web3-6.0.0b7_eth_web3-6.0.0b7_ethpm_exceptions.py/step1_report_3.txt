  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the Py-EthPM project.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is purely structural code defining exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class definitions with docstrings and pass statements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base error class, each with descriptive docstrings. There are no data processing, network operations, or untrusted input handling present. The structure is straightforward and static, serving as a foundation for error handling in the larger project. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard, well-structured exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger codebase for error management without any harmful components.",
