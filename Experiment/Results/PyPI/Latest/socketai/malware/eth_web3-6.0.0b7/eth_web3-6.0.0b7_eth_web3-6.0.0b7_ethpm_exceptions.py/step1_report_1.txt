  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions in the Py-EthPM package.",
  "sources": "No external input or data read; class definitions and docstrings are static code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; purely static class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. All classes are simple and contain only docstrings and pass statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base error class. Each class is documented with descriptive docstrings and uses 'pass' for the body, indicating straightforward error class declarations. No data input, output, network operations, or dynamic code execution occurs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception definitions for a Python package. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
