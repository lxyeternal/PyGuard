{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors related to Py-EthPM operations.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, with standard exception class definitions. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception class. Each class is documented and has no methods or logic beyond class declaration. There are no data inputs, network interactions, or suspicious constructs. This appears to be standard boilerplate code for error handling within a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of custom exceptions with no malicious behavior detected. It is part of an error handling mechanism and does not perform any security-sensitive actions or contain malicious payloads.",
