  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception class.\n   - Each class has a descriptive docstring and contains only a `pass` statement.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Logical and Structural Evaluation**:\n   - The classes are straightforward, standard in Python for error handling.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code serves as boilerplate for error management in a larger project.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 for all reports, which is appropriate given the static, straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 for all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior or payloads.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: 0, as no security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are evident.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions with no dynamic or external interactions, the likelihood of hidden malicious behavior is negligible.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the code content.\n\n5. **Final Recommendations**:\n   - Given the static, benign nature of the code, I would agree with the reported scores:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - The high confidence (1) in all reports is justified.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - If these exception classes are used within a larger codebase, the overall security assessment should consider the entire project.\n   - However, based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a standard, non-malicious set of exception class definitions.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
