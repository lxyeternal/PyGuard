  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base error class.\n   - The classes are static, with no methods, data processing, network calls, or dynamic behavior.\n   - The code is straightforward, well-documented, and typical for error handling in Python projects.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation:**\n   - No signs of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious logic are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, external dependencies, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The exception classes are simple, with only `pass` statements, serving as error markers.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the simplicity and transparency.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious activity or payloads.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation of Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely static class definitions for exceptions, the assigned scores are appropriate.\n   - There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities based on this code snippet; it’s standard boilerplate.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n6. **My Personal Estimate:**\n   - **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n   - **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n   - **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is standard, non-malicious exception class definitions with no security concerns.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nNo changes needed to the scores. The assessment aligns well with the code’s nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign set of exception class definitions, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 justified and appropriate.",
