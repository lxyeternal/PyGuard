  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base exception class (`PyEthPMError`).\n   - Each class has a descriptive docstring and an empty body (`pass`).\n   - There are no data inputs, external calls, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Logical and Structural Review:**\n   - The code is straightforward, serving as boilerplate for error handling.\n   - It adheres to common Python patterns for defining custom exceptions.\n   - The classes are static, with no methods or logic that could be exploited.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the static, straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports; no malicious behavior or payloads are present.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** 0 in all reports; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are introduced by this code.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that these are simple exception class definitions with no malicious intent.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code is purely structural.\n   - The reports' scores seem appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Final Assessment:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0.\n   - **Risk Score:** Should be 0, as there's no security risk.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe, and non-malicious pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python. No further action or concern is warranted.",
