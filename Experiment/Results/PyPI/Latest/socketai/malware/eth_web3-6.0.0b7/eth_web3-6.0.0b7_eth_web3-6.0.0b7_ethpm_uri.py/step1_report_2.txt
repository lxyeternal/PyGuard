{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for resolving URIs, creating content-addressed GitHub URIs, checking supported URIs, generating block URIs, and verifying chain matches within a blockchain context.",
  "sources": "URI parameters, external HTTP requests (requests.get), environment variables via requests (e.g., response content), web3 calls (w3.eth.get_block).",
  "sinks": "Return values (e.g., resolved content, URIs, booleans), HTTP responses, exceptions, and external backend calls.",
  "flows": "Input URIs from function parameters to external network requests (e.g., requests.get), then process data and return or raise exceptions based on conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code detected. Usage of requests to fetch GitHub data is standard. No evident data exfiltration or malicious side effects. External calls appear to be for legitimate URI resolution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs URI resolution through backend services and external HTTP calls to GitHub, processes blockchain data, and performs validation checks. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious data handling are evident. Functions rely on external libraries for network requests and blockchain interactions, with proper error handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for handling blockchain-related URIs, resolving content, and verifying chain data. No malware or malicious intent is detectable. The overall security risk is low, provided the external dependencies and network interactions are secure and trusted.",
