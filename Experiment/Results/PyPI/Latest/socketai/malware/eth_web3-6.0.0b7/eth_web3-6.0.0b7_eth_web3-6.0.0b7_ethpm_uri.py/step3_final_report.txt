{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for URI resolution, content-addressed URI creation, validation, and blockchain chain verification.",
  "sources": "External URIs via requests.get, blockchain data via Web3 (get_block, get_resolvable_backends_for_uri, get_translatable_backends_for_uri, parse_BIP122_uri, get_genesis_block_hash).",
  "sinks": "Parsing JSON responses, hash comparisons, blockchain data retrieval, raising exceptions on invalid URIs or data types.",
  "flows": "URI input -> external HTTP request or blockchain call -> JSON parsing or hash validation -> return content or raise exception.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. External requests lack explicit timeout/error handling but are standard for such utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URI resolution and blockchain validation with proper error handling. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. External data fetching could be exploited for DoS, but the code itself does not facilitate malicious actions. No obfuscation or backdoors detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential operational concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility module for blockchain URI handling with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at zero.",
