{
  "purpose": "Defines directory paths and a function to locate a specific JSON spec file within a package directory structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads the `__file__` attribute to determine the current file's directory, and checks for the existence of 'spec/v3.spec.json' within a subdirectory.",
  "sinks": "The function checks for the existence of a file; no data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading the current file path, constructing a path to the spec file, and verifying its existence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes directory paths relative to the current file location. It defines a function that constructs a path to a JSON specification file within a subdirectory and raises an error if the file is missing. No untrusted input, external communication, or malicious behavior is evident. The import statements are for local modules and include no suspicious activity. Overall, the code is straightforward configuration logic with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard directory and file path operations to locate a specific JSON file within a package structure. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a benign configuration utility.",
