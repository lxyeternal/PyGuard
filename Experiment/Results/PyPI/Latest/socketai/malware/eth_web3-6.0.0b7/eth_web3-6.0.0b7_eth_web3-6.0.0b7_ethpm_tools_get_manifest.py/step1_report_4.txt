{
  "purpose": "The code loads and parses JSON manifest files related to ethpm specifications from specified directories.",
  "sources": "File system reads from directories returned by get_ethpm_spec_dir() and the constant ASSETS_DIR.",
  "sinks": "json.loads() parsing of file contents; no direct output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Read text from files at specified paths, then parse JSON content into Python dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious commands, or obfuscated code present. Usage of dynamic path composition is standard for file access.",
  "analysis": "The functions retrieve directory paths via get_ethpm_spec_dir() and ASSETS_DIR, then read JSON files from those locations, parsing their contents. The code relies on external functions and constants for directory paths. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data handling is evident. The file reading and JSON parsing are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code appears to be a simple utility for loading configuration data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard file loading utility with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply reads JSON files from specific directories and parses their contents. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage.",
