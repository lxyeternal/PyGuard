  "purpose": "Functions to read and parse JSON files from specified directories based on use case and filename.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'use_case' and 'filename' used to construct file paths; external functions get_ethpm_spec_dir() and constant ASSETS_DIR provide directory locations.",
  "sinks": "None; data is read from files and parsed, no untrusted data is executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'use_case' and 'filename' flow into path construction, then into file reading and JSON parsing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of input validation on 'use_case' and 'filename' may allow path traversal if inputs are malicious, but no malicious code or behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file path construction and JSON reading without executing code or performing network operations. Multiple reviews agree that there is no malicious activity or obfuscation. The main concern is potential path traversal due to unvalidated inputs, but this is a common pattern in utility functions and does not constitute malicious behavior. Scores across reports consistently assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, with risk scores around 0.2 reflecting the validation concern. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and safe, with a minor security consideration regarding input validation. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The slight risk score of 0.2 accurately reflects the potential for exploitation if inputs are maliciously crafted, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are present.",
