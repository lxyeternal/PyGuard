{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load and parse JSON manifest files related to the ethpm package, using specific directories and filenames as input parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from files located at paths constructed from get_ethpm_spec_dir(), ASSETS_DIR, use_case, and filename.",
  "sinks": "JSON parsing via json.loads() could be a sink if the input data is maliciously crafted, but in this context, it is simply reading local files.",
  "flows": "Path: Directory paths obtained from get_ethpm_spec_dir() and ASSETS_DIR -> concatenated with use_case and filename -> read_text() -> json.loads()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward file reading and JSON parsing with no obfuscation, code injection, or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines two functions for loading JSON manifests from specified directories. It constructs file paths dynamically based on function parameters and reads their contents as text before parsing into dictionaries. The functions rely on external functions and constants (get_ethpm_spec_dir() and ASSETS_DIR), which are presumed to be safe. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code does not execute untrusted input or perform operations that could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate file loading and JSON parsing operations with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard utility functions for managing configuration or manifest files.",
