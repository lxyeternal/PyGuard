{
  "purpose": "The code scans specific directories on an Android device for image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png) and exfiltrates them by uploading to a Telegram bot API endpoint using hardcoded credentials, indicating malicious data theft.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() calls on '/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Screenshots/' and '/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Camera/', reading image files in binary mode.",
  "sinks": "requests.session().post() calls to 'https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/sendDocument' with file data, transmitting potentially sensitive images to an external server.",
  "flows": "Source: os.listdir() reading image files -> open() reading file contents -> requests.post() sending files to Telegram API endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; silent exception handling with try-except-pass; repeated POST requests per file; no user consent or notification.",
  "analysis": "The code searches device directories for images, opens each image, and uploads them via POST requests to a Telegram bot API, using embedded credentials. Error handling is suppressed, which could hide failures. The pattern indicates covert data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the behavior is malicious, aiming to steal user images without consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious exfiltration of user images via Telegram, with hardcoded credentials and silent error handling, strongly indicating malware activity. The behavior is covert and privacy-invasive, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
