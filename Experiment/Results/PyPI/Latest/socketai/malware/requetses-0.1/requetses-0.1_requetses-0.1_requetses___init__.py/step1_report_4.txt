  "purpose": "The code appears to collect image files from specific directories on an Android device and send them via Telegram to a specified chat, potentially for unauthorized data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() reads files from '/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Screenshots/' and '/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Camera/'.",
  "sinks": "Requests to Telegram API endpoint 'https://api.telegram.org/bot{Token2_Golden}/sendDocument' using session.post() with file data.",
  "flows": "File system reading (sources) leads to file uploads over network (sinks) via POST requests.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID. No error handling beyond pass statements, no verification of files. The code actively exfiltrates image files without user consent. No legitimate functionality justifies this behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes with hardcoded credentials for a Telegram bot and a chat ID. It scans two specific directories for image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png). For each file found, it opens and sends the file to the Telegram chat via API requests. The process is repeated for both directories. The lack of error handling beyond silent passes suggests concealment. The purpose appears to be surreptitious collection and transmission of potentially sensitive images, which is typical of data theft or malicious exfiltration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a data exfiltration tool, collecting images from device directories and uploading them to a Telegram account using hardcoded credentials. This behavior indicates malicious intent, specifically privacy invasion and data theft. The presence of hardcoded tokens and silent exception handling further supports malicious activity.",
