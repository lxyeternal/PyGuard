{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect image files from specific directories on an Android device and send them via Telegram bot API, potentially for unauthorized data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() reading from '/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Screenshots/' and '/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Camera/' directories.",
  "sinks": "requests.session().post() sending files to Telegram API endpoint 'https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/sendDocument'.",
  "flows": "File paths are read from device directories, files are opened, and then sent over the network to a Telegram bot URL.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, repeated POST requests for each file, lack of error handling logging, and no user consent implied. The code collects images potentially without user awareness.",
  "analysis": "The script hardcodes sensitive credentials (Token2_Golden and ID1_Golden). It scans specific device directories for images and automatically uploads any found files to a Telegram bot, which indicates data exfiltration. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors silently, hiding potential failures or suspicious activity. The repeated POST requests per file might be inefficient but suggest intentional data transfer. No other third-party malicious libraries are used; behavior is consistent with malware or spyware intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates image files from device directories to a remote server (Telegram), using hardcoded credentials. This behavior is suspicious and indicative of malicious data theft. The absence of user prompts or transparency further supports malicious intent.",
