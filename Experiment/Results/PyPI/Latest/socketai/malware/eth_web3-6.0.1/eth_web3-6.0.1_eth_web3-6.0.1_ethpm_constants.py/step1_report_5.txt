  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters related to Ethereum, IPFS, GitHub, and supported blockchain networks.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions; no external input sources are explicitly read in this code segment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides configuration constants for schemes, regular expressions, backend URLs, IPFS gateways, GitHub API, and supported chain IDs. All are static data definitions without any input/output operations, control flow, or executable logic. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a standard configuration setup with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and purposeful, serving as part of a larger application’s configuration.",
