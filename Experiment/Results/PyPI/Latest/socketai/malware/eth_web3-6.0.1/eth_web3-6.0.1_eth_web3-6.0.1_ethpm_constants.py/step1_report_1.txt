  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters for interacting with IPFS, Ethereum networks, and GitHub API.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; purely configuration constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static configuration constants used for networking protocols, regex validation, and supported network IDs. No dynamic input handling, no data processing, no network communications, and no security-sensitive operations are present. It appears to be standard setup code defining parameters for IPFS gateways, Ethereum chain IDs, and GitHub API endpoint.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a set of configuration constants used for establishing network connections and validating input formats.",
