  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided and cross-referencing with the original code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as static configuration constants, with no external input, data processing, or network communication.\n- They consistently conclude there are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, which seem appropriate given the content.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** No issues, static configuration, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard configuration constants.\n- **Score justification:** No malware, no obfuscation, no security risk.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, static constants, no dynamic code.\n- **Score justification:** No malware, no obfuscation, no security risk.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous, straightforward configuration data.\n- **Score justification:** No malware, no obfuscation, no security risk.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Same as others, purely configuration constants.\n- **Score justification:** No malware, no obfuscation, no security risk.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Critical Analysis:**\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None. All constants are static, well-defined, and serve configuration purposes.\n- **Obfuscation:** No signs of obfuscation or code hiding.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The code does not process external data, handle secrets, or execute logic that could be exploited.\n- **Scores:** The scores are consistent with the analysis, all being zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n- The reported scores are appropriate.\n- Given the static, configuration-only nature of the code, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- Malware score remains at 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- Obfuscated remains at 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of my evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis. No changes are necessary based on the provided reports and code snippet.",
