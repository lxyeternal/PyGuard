  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as static configuration constants related to IPFS, Ethereum, GitHub, and network IDs.\n- No external input, dynamic code, or network communication is involved.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, and confidence is high (1), indicating they see no malicious intent.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, aligning with the above.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippets are purely static constants and regex patterns.\n- No evidence of code execution, data flow, or external data handling.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or mistakes are evident in the reports. They are thorough in stating the code is benign and configuration-only.\n- The reports are consistent in their assessments.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- Malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the static nature and lack of malicious behavior.\n- The risk scores are 0, justified by the absence of vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, there is no need to adjust scores.\n- The code is straightforward, and the high confidence scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected or suggested.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward constants with no obfuscation.  \n**Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified; purely configuration data.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard configuration module with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and comprehensive. No adjustments needed. The code is safe, benign, and purely declarative.",
