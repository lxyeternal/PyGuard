{
  "purpose": "Define configuration constants and supported network identifiers for a Python application interacting with Ethereum, IPFS, and GitHub APIs.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, regex pattern, and static string assignments",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or output operations are present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external inputs; code only sets static configuration values",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; all variables are static and well-defined",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constants, regex patterns, and dictionaries mapping network IDs to names. There are no input/output operations, no external data processing, nor dynamic execution or obfuscation. All variables are predefined configuration parameters related to registry schemes, IPFS, GitHub, and Ethereum networks. No credentials, secrets, or code injection points are present. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely configuration data with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It defines constants and mappings used for network and protocol configurations in a larger application context.",
