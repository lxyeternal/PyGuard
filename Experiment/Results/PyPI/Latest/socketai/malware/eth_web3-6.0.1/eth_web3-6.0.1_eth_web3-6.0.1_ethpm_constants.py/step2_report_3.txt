  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the provided assessments.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of static configuration constants.\n- No external input handling, data processing, or network communication is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward setup for network protocols, validation, and supported networks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**Presence of Issues:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious behavior, dynamic logic, or external data handling.\n- The reports are consistent in stating that these are configuration constants with no security risks.\n\n**Errors or Flaws in the Reports:**\n- The reasoning is sound; all reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No logical errors or flawed conclusions are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring and Justification:\n\n**Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the static nature and lack of malicious indicators.\n- No change needed here.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Security Risk Score:**\n- All reports assign 0, which is justified. No vulnerabilities or insecure patterns are present.\n\n**Risk Score (overall):**\n- All reports assign 0, aligning with the assessment that there's no security concern.\n\n**Exception:**\n- The \"risk\" score is not explicitly detailed in the reports, but given the context, it should be consistent with malware and obfuscated scores.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  None of the reports suggest any speculative vulnerabilities. They correctly identify the code as purely configuration data.\n\n- **Potential issues overlooked?**  \n  - The only minor point is that, although the code is safe, hardcoded constants can sometimes be problematic if they contain sensitive data. Here, they are all benign constants, so no issue.\n\n- **Any inconsistency in scores?**  \n  - No, all scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Security Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a simple configuration module with no malicious or security-sensitive content.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code snippet is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. No further action required.",
