  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters related to Ethereum and IPFS integration, including registry schemes, regex patterns, default backend URLs, and supported network IDs.",
  "sources": "Constants and configuration values, no external input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static configuration definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; all variables are straightforward constants.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static configuration variables defining URI schemes, regex patterns, backend URLs, gateway URLs, and supported Ethereum network IDs. No external inputs, dynamic code execution, or sensitive data handling present. The constants are used for configuration and validation purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative configuration data with no malicious intent or security risks. It provides constants for use within a larger application, without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
