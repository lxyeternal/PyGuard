  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the underlying code and its security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code consists solely of static constants, regex patterns, and mappings.\n- No dynamic input handling, network communication, or data processing is present.\n- No secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are involved.\n- The constants are appropriate for configuration purposes, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** No issues; purely static configuration.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No concerns.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; static constants for Ethereum/IPFS configuration.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Static configuration, no external data or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No concerns.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Pure configuration data, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n- **Malware scores:** Consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk scores:** All 0, which is reasonable given the static, configuration-only nature of the code.\n\n### **Potential discrepancies or concerns:**\n- None of the reports suggest any malicious intent or security vulnerability.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, dynamic behavior, or secret handling.\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the code. There are no underlying issues that warrant higher scores.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code provided. No modifications to scores are necessary. The code is a standard configuration module with no security concerns.",
