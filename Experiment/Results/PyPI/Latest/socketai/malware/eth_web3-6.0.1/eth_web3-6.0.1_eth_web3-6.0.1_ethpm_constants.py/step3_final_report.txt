  "purpose": "Define configuration constants for protocol schemes, regex validation, IPFS backend, gateway URLs, and supported blockchain network IDs.",
  "sources": "Static constant definitions, regex pattern, URL strings, and network ID mappings.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; purely static configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or dynamic data processing involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; all constants are straightforward and well-defined.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static configuration constants with no dynamic input, network communication, or data processing. No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The constants serve as configuration parameters for protocols, URLs, regex validation, and network IDs. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected. The code is clear, well-structured, and serves its purpose without risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static configuration data with no malicious or security concerns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero. No modifications are necessary.",
