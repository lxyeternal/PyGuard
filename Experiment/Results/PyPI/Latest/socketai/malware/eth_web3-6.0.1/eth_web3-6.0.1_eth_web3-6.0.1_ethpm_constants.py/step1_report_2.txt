  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters related to Ethereum and IPFS protocols, including registry schemes, regex validation for package names, backend URLs, gateway prefixes, and supported network IDs.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments and data definitions; no external input or data reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing, output, or external communication based on this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code consists solely of static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs are present. The use of string constants and simple data structures appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides configuration constants for a Python package related to Ethereum and IPFS integrations. It includes scheme identifiers, regex for package validation, backend URLs, IPFS gateway URLs, and supported network IDs. All elements are static, hardcoded constants with no dynamic or external data processing. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The constants seem appropriate for their intended use, with no evident malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a standard configuration setup with no malicious or suspicious content. It does not exhibit malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The data appears safe and intended solely for application configuration purposes.",
