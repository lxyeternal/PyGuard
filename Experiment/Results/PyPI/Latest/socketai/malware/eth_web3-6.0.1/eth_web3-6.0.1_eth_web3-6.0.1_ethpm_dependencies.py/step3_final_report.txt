  "purpose": "Manage a collection of Package dependencies with validation and retrieval methods.",
  "sources": "External validation function validate_package_name(), build_dependencies dictionary",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Input package names -> validation -> retrieval from build_dependencies",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward dependency management code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Dependencies class managing Package instances via a dictionary. It validates package names with an external function and provides methods to access items, values, and specific dependencies. No network, file, or obfuscation activities are present. The code is clear, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. External validation reliance is noted but assumed safe. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured dependency management utility with no malicious or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), primarily due to reliance on external validation. The reports are consistent and accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
