  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for resolving URIs, creating content-addressed GitHub URIs, validating supported URIs, creating block URIs based on blockchain data, and checking if a blockchain matches a specific chain URI.",
  "sources": "URI input parameters in functions: resolve_uri_contents, create_content_addressed_github_uri, is_supported_content_addressed_uri, create_latest_block_uri, check_if_chain_matches_chain_uri; external API requests in create_content_addressed_github_uri; blockchain data from Web3 instance in create_latest_block_uri and check_if_chain_matches_chain_uri.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs in create_content_addressed_github_uri; fetching blockchain data via Web3 in create_latest_block_uri and check_if_chain_matches_chain_uri.",
  "flows": "Input URI is used to fetch data via HTTP request or blockchain call; data is processed and returned or used to generate URIs; in create_content_addressed_github_uri, external request fetches GitHub content; in create_latest_block_uri, blockchain data determines the URI; in check_if_chain_matches_chain_uri, blockchain data is validated against URI info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic observed. The code interacts with external systems via requests and blockchain calls in a standard manner.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard libraries and patterns for URI resolution, HTTP requests, and blockchain interactions. The functions perform validation, data fetching, and URI creation without executing any suspicious or hidden actions. External requests are standard API calls, and blockchain interactions use Web3's API to access block data. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No obfuscation, suspicious code constructs, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for handling URIs related to blockchain and content-addressed resources. It performs expected operations such as validation, fetching, and URI creation without malicious intent. No security risks or malware are identified based on the provided code.",
