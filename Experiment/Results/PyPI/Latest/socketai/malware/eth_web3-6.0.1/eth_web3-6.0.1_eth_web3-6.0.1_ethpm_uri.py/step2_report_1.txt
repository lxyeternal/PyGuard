  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code handles URI resolution, external API requests, and blockchain data.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. External calls are standard, with proper error handling.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with no malicious intent or malware.\n\n**Assessment:** The logic and implementation are straightforward. No issues found. Malware score: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (low).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions for URI resolution, external API calls, and blockchain data.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. External dependencies are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate utility, with no security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with report 1. Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** URI resolution, GitHub API interactions, blockchain validation.\n- **Findings:** No secrets, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation. Recursive calls are standard for URI resolution.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is standard for such utilities. Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** URI resolution, network requests, blockchain data.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation. Network and blockchain calls are typical.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is legitimate. Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions, with external API and blockchain data.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, and the code does not contain any suspicious or hidden behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, with no obfuscation patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, mainly due to external dependencies and network calls, which are standard for such utilities but could be exploited if the external sources are compromised.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** Given the reliance on external APIs and blockchain calls, a cautious score of **0.2** is appropriate, aligning with the reports.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility module for URI and blockchain data handling. No evidence of supply chain compromise, malware, or obfuscation is present. The security risk is minimal but not zero due to external dependencies.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nPlease let me know if further detailed analysis or specific focus areas are needed.",
