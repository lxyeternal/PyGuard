  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for resolving URIs, creating content-addressed URIs for GitHub, and verifying blockchain chain URIs in the context of Ethereum and IPFS integrations.",
  "sources": "URI input parameters in functions resolve_uri_contents, create_content_addressed_github_uri, create_latest_block_uri, check_if_chain_matches_chain_uri; network requests via requests.get; blockchain data via web3.eth calls.",
  "sinks": "requests.get responses; JSON parsing; web3.eth.get_block calls; exception raising; string manipulation; URI creation.",
  "flows": "URI inputs are validated and then fetched from network or blockchain; data from network or blockchain is parsed and used to produce new URIs or verify chain data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. Use of network requests and blockchain calls are standard; no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected. The recursive call in resolve_uri_contents could raise concerns if not properly controlled, but appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code implements URI resolution with fallbacks, network interactions via requests, and blockchain data retrieval using web3. It performs URI validation, fetches data from GitHub APIs, IPFS, and blockchain nodes. The network requests and blockchain calls are typical for such utilities, with proper error handling. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious string manipulations, or malicious payloads are evident. The functions are designed to support content-addressed URIs and chain verification, aligned with expected Ethereum and IPFS practices. Overall, the code appears legitimate and does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a utility library for URI handling and blockchain data verification within an Ethereum/IPFS context. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are apparent based on the provided code. The implementation appears standard and safe.",
