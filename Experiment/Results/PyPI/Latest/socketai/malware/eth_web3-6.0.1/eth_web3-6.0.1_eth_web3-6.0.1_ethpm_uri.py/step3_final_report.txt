{
  "purpose": "The code handles URI resolution, validation, and creation, involving external API requests (GitHub), IPFS checks, and blockchain interactions via Web3.",
  "sources": "Functions fetch URI contents via HTTP requests, interact with blockchain data through Web3, and validate URIs using helper functions.",
  "sinks": "External HTTP requests to GitHub API, IPFS URI checks, blockchain data retrieval, and recursive URI resolution.",
  "flows": "URI inputs are validated, then content is fetched via requests or blockchain calls; recursive resolution may occur for registry URIs; data flows from external sources to internal processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code structures detected. Recursive calls are standard for URI resolution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URI validation, content fetching, and blockchain data access. External calls are handled with proper error handling. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The recursive URI resolution is controlled and typical for such utilities. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are evident. External dependencies and network interactions are standard and do not suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for URI and blockchain data handling. No evidence of supply chain compromise, malware, or obfuscation is present. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external dependencies and network calls, which are typical for such functions.",
