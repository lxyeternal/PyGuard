  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly describes functions that resolve URIs, fetch content via HTTP, and interact with blockchain data.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious logic. External calls are standard API interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low). The confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes URI resolution, network requests, and blockchain data.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation. External dependencies are standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on URI validation, network requests, and blockchain data.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation. The recursive URI resolution is standard for such utilities.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Well-reasoned.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions, with emphasis on network and blockchain interactions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation. Standard use of requests and Web3 APIs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general pattern—URI resolution, network, and blockchain data.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity or obfuscation, standard API usage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is standard utility code for URI and blockchain interactions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero but low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern—mainly due to external network calls and blockchain interactions, which are typical for such utilities.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minor risk mainly from external dependencies and network calls, but no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Note:** The code's external interactions are standard for blockchain and URI handling utilities. No suspicious patterns or malicious logic are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Score |\n|--------------------|--------------|\n| Malware            | 0            |\n| Obfuscated         | 0            |\n| Security Risk      | 0.2          |\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's behavior.",
