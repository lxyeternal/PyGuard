  "purpose": "Manage Ethereum smart contract packages, including manifest validation, loading from files or URIs, contract factory and instance creation, dependencies, and deployments.",
  "sources": "Manifest data, file system (via Path), URI resolution, external validation functions, web3 contract creation.",
  "sinks": "Contract factory generation, contract instance deployment, deployment data processing, linked reference resolution.",
  "flows": "Manifest and URI inputs are validated and parsed, leading to contract factory creation and deployment data handling, including linked reference resolution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or malicious code patterns detected. The linked references and deployment handling are domain-specific but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package management tasks for Ethereum contracts, including manifest validation, URI resolution, contract factory and instance creation, dependency management, and deployment handling. It relies on external validation functions and web3 interactions, all typical for such SDKs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or supply chain attacks are present. The linked reference resolution and deployment processing are domain-specific but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Ethereum package management class with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low risk score (around 0.2) reflects inherent operational risks but no malicious activity.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
