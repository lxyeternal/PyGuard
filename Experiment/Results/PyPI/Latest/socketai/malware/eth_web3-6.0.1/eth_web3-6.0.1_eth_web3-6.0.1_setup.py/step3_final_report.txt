  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining dependencies, metadata, and package data for 'eth_web3'.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; static dependency lists; no untrusted input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processed; no network or system calls; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "File I/O for README.md; static data for dependencies and metadata; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, conventional setup.py without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with explicit dependencies, static data, and no dynamic or malicious behavior. Dependencies are version-restricted, reducing supply chain risks. No obfuscation, no code injection, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted input are present. The code adheres to best practices for Python packaging and shows no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package configuration file with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The dependency specifications are explicit and safe. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero.",
