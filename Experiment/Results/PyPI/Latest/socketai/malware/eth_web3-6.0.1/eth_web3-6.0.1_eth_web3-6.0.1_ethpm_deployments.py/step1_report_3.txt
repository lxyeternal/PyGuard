{
  "purpose": "Provides a class for managing and accessing deployed contract data and instances within a blockchain environment.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from constructor parameters 'deployment_data' and 'contract_instances'. No external data reading or user input occurs within the code.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not write to files, send data over the network, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into class attributes and through methods that retrieve or validate data; no untrusted input flow to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and methods for managing deployment data and contract instances, with validation checks for contract names. It relies on external validation functions but does not perform any dangerous operations or insecure data handling. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data management class with validation for contract deployment info. It appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
