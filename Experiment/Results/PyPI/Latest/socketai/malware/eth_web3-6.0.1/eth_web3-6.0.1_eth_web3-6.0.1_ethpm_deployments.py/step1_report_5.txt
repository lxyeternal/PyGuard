{
  "purpose": "The code manages deployment data and contract instances for Ethereum smart contracts, providing access and validation methods.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the deployment_data and contract_instances dictionaries passed during initialization, as well as the contract_name parameter in get_instance.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code mainly reads data and performs validation without executing untrusted code or writing output based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from deployment_data and contract_instances into internal methods; validation functions check contract names, and data is retrieved or returned without unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard data validation and retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing deployment data and contract instances with appropriate validation. It uses external validation for contract names, and methods are straightforward with no evident malicious intent. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated parts, or suspicious behaviors. The data flow is read-only with respect to untrusted input, and no external network or system modifications are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility for managing deployment data of Ethereum contracts. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are identified. It is safe based on the provided fragment.",
