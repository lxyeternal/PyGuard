  "purpose": "Manages deployment data and contract instances with validation to access deployed contract information.",
  "sources": "Deployment data dictionary, contract instances dictionary, external validate_contract_name function",
  "sinks": "Access methods calling validate_contract_name, data retrieval from deployment_data and contract_instances",
  "flows": "Input contract names -> validation via validate_contract_name -> access deployment_data or contract_instances",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward utility class for managing deployment data with validation. It performs no network operations, cryptography, or dynamic code execution. It relies on an external validation function which is presumed safe. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The data access patterns are standard, and the code structure is clear. The validation ensures only valid contract names are used to access data, but does not introduce security risks. Overall, the code appears benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing deployment data with validation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
