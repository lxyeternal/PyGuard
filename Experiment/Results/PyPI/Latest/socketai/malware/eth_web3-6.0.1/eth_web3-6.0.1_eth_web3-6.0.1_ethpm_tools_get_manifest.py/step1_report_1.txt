{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to load JSON manifest files from specified directories related to ethpm specifications and local assets.",
  "sources": "User-supplied parameters 'use_case' and 'filename' are used to construct file paths; reading text from files in directories.",
  "sinks": "Reading files based on input parameters could lead to path traversal if inputs are untrusted, potentially exposing or reading unintended files.",
  "flows": "use_case and filename -> file path construction -> read_text() -> json.loads() for parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; functions rely on external functions and variables; no network or system modifications present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that load JSON files from constructed paths. It depends on external functions get_ethpm_spec_dir() and constants like ASSETS_DIR. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration. However, if 'use_case' and 'filename' are untrusted, they could be used in a path traversal attack to access unauthorized files. The code itself does not sanitize inputs, but this is typical for such utility functions. Overall, the code appears straightforward and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple file loader for JSON manifests, with no direct signs of malicious behavior or malware. Potential security concern exists if inputs are not validated externally, but the code itself is benign.",
