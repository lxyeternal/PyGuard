  "purpose": "Functions load JSON files from specified directories based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'use_case' and 'filename' used to construct file paths; external functions get_ethpm_spec_dir() and constant ASSETS_DIR provide base directories.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations; JSON deserialization.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> path construction -> file read -> JSON parse.",
  "anomalies": "No input validation or sanitization shown; reliance on external functions and constants; potential for path traversal if inputs are untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file reading and JSON parsing using provided parameters and external directory functions. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is unvalidated input parameters that could lead to directory traversal attacks if inputs are malicious, but this is a common pattern in utility functions and outside the code's malicious scope. The malware score is correctly 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting clear, understandable code. The risk score of 0.2 accounts for potential path traversal if inputs are untrusted, which is a minor concern given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple JSON file loading with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The only security consideration is input validation to prevent path traversal, which is outside the scope of this snippet. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
