  "purpose": "This code loads JSON manifest files from specified directories related to ethpm assets and specifications.",
  "sources": "Reads text files from directories obtained via get_ethpm_spec_dir() and ASSETS_DIR.",
  "sinks": "json.loads() deserializes file contents into Python dictionaries, potentially executing malicious JSON if the files are compromised.",
  "flows": "File read operations -> json.loads() parsing -> output dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual code constructs. Usage of external functions to determine directory paths is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions to load JSON files from specific directories, using standard library functions and external directory providers. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The file reading operations depend on external functions for directory paths but do not themselves pose security issues. The JSON parsing is straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical implementation for loading configuration or manifest files, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
