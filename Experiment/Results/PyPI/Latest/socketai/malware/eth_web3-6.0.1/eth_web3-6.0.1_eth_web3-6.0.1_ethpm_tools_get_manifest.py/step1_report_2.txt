  "purpose": "Utility functions to load JSON manifest files from specified directories related to ethpm specifications and assets.",
  "sources": "Paths constructed using get_ethpm_spec_dir() and ASSETS_DIR; reading text from files specified by use_case and filename.",
  "sinks": "json.loads() processing data read from files, potential for deserialization issues if input files are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "File read (path constructed from directory variables) -> data passed to json.loads() for parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of path concatenation suggests flexible file loading, but no validation of input parameters is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for reading JSON files from specific directories. It relies on external functions and constants for directory paths. The functions read files as text and parse them with json.loads(). No user input is directly involved; however, the use of parameters for filenames and use_case could be manipulated if untrusted inputs are passed, leading to potential directory traversal or malicious file reading. There is no input validation or sanitization shown. No malicious behavior or malware is evident. The code is straightforward and appears benign, intended for configuration or data loading purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for reading JSON manifests from specified directories, with no evidence of malicious intent. Its security risk is low, assuming proper validation of input parameters is enforced elsewhere. There is no malware or obfuscated code present.",
