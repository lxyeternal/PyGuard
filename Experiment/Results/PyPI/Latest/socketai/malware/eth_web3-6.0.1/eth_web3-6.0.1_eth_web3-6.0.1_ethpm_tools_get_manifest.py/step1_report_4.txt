  "sources": "File system reads: (ethpm_spec_dir / \"examples\" / use_case / filename).read_text() and (ASSETS_DIR / use_case / filename).read_text()",
  "sinks": "JSON parsing via json.loads() on data read from the filesystem",
  "flows": "File read (source) -> JSON load (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the functions simply read and parse JSON files from specified directories without user input or external network interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that load JSON data from filesystem paths constructed from parameters. Both functions rely on external directories obtained from imported functions or constants, and parse the data into Python dictionaries. There is no user input, network activity, or data manipulation that could introduce malicious payloads. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic. The only potential concern is if the underlying directories or files contain malicious content, but this cannot be determined from the code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple file reading and JSON parsing operations with no evident malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be utility functions for accessing static JSON manifests, and does not exhibit malware or security risks by itself.",
