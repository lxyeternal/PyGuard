{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling within the Py-EthPM project.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code consists solely of class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions; no external output or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving external or untrusted data; purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. All classes are simple, with docstrings explaining their purpose. There are no functions, no data processing, no input/output operations, nor any dynamic or obfuscated code. The structure is straightforward, intended for error handling, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions used for error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious code elements. The design is clear and conventional, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
