  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's `Exception`. Each class has a descriptive docstring, and there are no functions, data processing, external input/output, or network activities.  \n   **Conclusion**: No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is straightforward, standard, and contains no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent. They correctly identify that the code is purely for error handling with no suspicious elements.  \n   **Conclusion**: The reasoning and summaries are accurate and consistent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the code's nature.  \n   **Suggestion**: No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports and the code itself show no malicious or suspicious activity, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.  \n   **Conclusion**: The risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   **Conclusion**: Correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports are cautious and evidence-based, noting only the code's simplicity and standard practice. There are no unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.  \n   **Conclusion**: No unwarranted claims.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.  \n   **Conclusion**: The scoring aligns well with the content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes used for error handling. It is benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues. The reports correctly reflect this assessment.\n\n**Final Recommendation**: No adjustments needed. The current scores are appropriate given the evidence.",
