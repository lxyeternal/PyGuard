  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in the Py-EthPM package.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions with static docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no output or network interaction.",
  "flows": "None; static class definitions with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class definitions without any complex or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base error class. Each class contains only a docstring describing its purpose, and no other code or behavior is present. There are no input/output operations, no data handling, no network connections, or any suspicious constructs. The structure is typical for defining error types in Python projects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious code flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe set of custom exception class definitions used for error handling within the Py-EthPM project. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks. It is benign and purely structural.",
