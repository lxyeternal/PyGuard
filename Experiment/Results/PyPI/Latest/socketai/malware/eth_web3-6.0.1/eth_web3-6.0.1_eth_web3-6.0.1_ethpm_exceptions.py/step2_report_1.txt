  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and typical for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This is correct, as there is no malicious activity, payload, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and do not assume malicious intent where none exists.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as standard exception class definitions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analyses.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the thorough reviews, I concur with the existing scores. The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Score | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0       | No malicious code, payload, or suspicious behavior present.|\n| Obfuscated      | 0       | Code is clear, simple class definitions, no obfuscation.   |\n| Security Risk   | 0       | No vulnerabilities, external data handling, or security issues.|\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scoring accurately reflects this assessment.",
