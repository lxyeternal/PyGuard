  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the Py-EthPM package.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, inheritance from Exception, docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, no external data handling, no sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flows or input/output processing, just class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception base class. There are no data inputs, external data sources, or sinks. No dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no credential handling are present. The structure is straightforward and conventional for defining custom exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains standard class definitions for custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security risks. It is benign and purely functional for error handling within the larger codebase.",
