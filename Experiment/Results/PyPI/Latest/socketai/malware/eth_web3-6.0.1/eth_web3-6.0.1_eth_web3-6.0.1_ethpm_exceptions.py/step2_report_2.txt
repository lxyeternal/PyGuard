  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Exception, with descriptive docstrings. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or external input handling. The code appears straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is purely structural for error handling, with no malicious or suspicious elements. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate since the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, matching the absence of any malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security risk score:** 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   Since the code is only defining exception classes without any dynamic or external interactions, there is no basis for assigning a higher malware or security risk score.\n\n5. **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   None of the reports make unwarranted assumptions; they all accurately state that the code is benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The scores are consistent and reasonable given the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, non-malicious set of custom exception class definitions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score should remain at 0.\n\n**Final estimation:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score |\n|---------|--------------|------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0          |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
