  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the Py-EthPM project.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from Exception, no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from the base Exception class, each with descriptive docstrings. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose for error categorization within a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
