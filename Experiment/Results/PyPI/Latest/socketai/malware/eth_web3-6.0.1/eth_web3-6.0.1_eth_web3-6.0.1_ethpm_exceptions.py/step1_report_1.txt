  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the Py-EthPM package.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from Exception; no external input or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code primarily defines error classes without processing external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is only class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from the base Exception class. Each class has a descriptive docstring explaining its purpose. There are no functions, data processing, external input handling, or network activities. The code appears to be standard practice for defining custom exceptions in Python projects. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes used for error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code segment.",
