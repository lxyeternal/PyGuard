  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is purely a set of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - No external input, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - The code is straightforward, with descriptive docstrings, and contains no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign and standard practice for defining error classes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is only defining exception classes, with no malicious or security-sensitive behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are apparent in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Since the code is purely structural and has no malicious or risky behavior, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - There is no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's static analysis.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is safe and standard.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.** There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis, confirming that the code is purely structural and safe.",
