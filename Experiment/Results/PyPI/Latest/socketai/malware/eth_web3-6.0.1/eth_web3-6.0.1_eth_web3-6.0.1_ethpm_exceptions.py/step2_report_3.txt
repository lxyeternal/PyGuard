  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's `Exception` class.\n   - Each class has a descriptive docstring explaining its purpose.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external input/output, network activity, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is static and purely structural, serving as an error handling mechanism.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n   - The code is standard practice for defining custom exceptions in Python projects.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is straightforward, benign, and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n4. **Score Review and Justification**:\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0 (correct, code is clear and straightforward).\n   - **Malware score**: 0 (correct, no malicious activity or payloads).\n   - **Security risk score**: 0 (correct, no vulnerabilities or risks identified).\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Score Justification**:\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions for error handling, it does not pose any security threat.\n   - The risk score of 0 is appropriate; no reason to elevate it.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious intent or payloads are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign.\n   - No suspicious claims are made about potential vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - All scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n   - The confidence level of 1 is justified given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and purely structural.",
