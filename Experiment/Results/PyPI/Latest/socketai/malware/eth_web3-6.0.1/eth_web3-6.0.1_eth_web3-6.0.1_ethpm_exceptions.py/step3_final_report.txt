{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in the PyEthPM framework.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception, with descriptive docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No data input, external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static class definitions, no data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions for custom exceptions, each with clear docstrings. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The code is straightforward, standard for error handling, and contains no suspicious or malicious elements. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No logical flaws or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are accurate and should remain at zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
