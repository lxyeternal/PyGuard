  "purpose": "Constructs directory paths relative to the current file and verifies the existence of 'ethpm-spec/spec/v3.spec.json', raising an error if missing.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__ to determine directory paths; checks for the existence of 'spec/v3.spec.json' within the 'ethpm-spec' directory.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Path construction from __file__ to the JSON file existence check; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward filesystem validation and module imports without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines directory paths based on the current file location, then checks for the presence of a specific JSON file. If the file is missing, it raises a FileNotFoundError with instructions to initialize submodules. It imports internal modules without processing untrusted input or executing external commands. No network activity, user input handling, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected. The logic is static and standard for setup routines, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup routine performing directory path construction and validation. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0, which are appropriate given the code's nature.",
