  "purpose": "Define directory paths and verify existence of a specific JSON specification file related to ethpm.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __file__ attribute to determine directory paths, and checks for the existence of 'spec/v3.spec.json' within the ethpm-spec directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present. The code performs file existence checks and imports modules, which are standard operations.",
  "flows": "Path definitions and file existence check flow from directory path construction to validation. Imports are static and do not involve untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code performs standard path operations and file validation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets directory paths based on the current file location, checks for the presence of a specific JSON file, and raises an error if missing. Imports are static, standard, and do not involve any untrusted data. No code execution based on untrusted input, no network activity, no sensitive data handling, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard directory and file existence operations with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
