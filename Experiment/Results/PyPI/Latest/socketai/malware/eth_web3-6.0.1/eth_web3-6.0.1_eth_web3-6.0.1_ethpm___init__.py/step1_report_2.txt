  "purpose": "Define directory paths related to the ethpm specification and verify the existence of a specific JSON file; import relevant modules.",
  "sources": "File system paths (__file__, Path), imported modules (.package, .backends.registry).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Path definitions and file existence check flow within the local file system; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets observed. The file existence check is standard for ensuring resources are available.",
  "analysis": "The code sets directory paths relative to the current file, checks for the presence of a specific JSON file, and raises an exception if not found. It imports internal modules, which is normal for modular codebases. No user input, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, primarily setting directory paths and verifying file existence without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is standard setup code for a package.",
