{
  "purpose": "The code installs a Python package named 'pojang_resorter' and, during installation, takes a screenshot of the user's screen and sends it to a specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads user environment when the screenshot is taken (via ImageGrab.grab()), and makes an HTTP POST request to the specified webhook URL with the screenshot file.",
  "sinks": "The POST request sends data (the screenshot) to an external URL (Discord webhook), which is a potential data exfiltration point.",
  "flows": "Source (ImageGrab.grab()) creates a screenshot → screenshot saved into buffer → buffer sent via requests.post to webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically sends a screenshot to an external webhook during installation without user consent, which is unusual behavior. No hardcoded credentials other than the webhook URL. The webhook URL appears fixed and potentially malicious or privacy-invasive.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a webhook URL. During installation via the custom install command, it calls post_install(). This function captures a screenshot using PIL's ImageGrab, saves it into a buffer, and then posts it to the specified Discord webhook URL. This process happens automatically upon package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior, as it exfiltrates user screen data without explicit consent. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating a fixed endpoint for data collection. The code does not obfuscate itself, and no other suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by automatically capturing and exfiltrating user screenshots during installation without user consent. This is a privacy violation and potentially malicious activity. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score indicates malicious intent.",
