{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to install a Python package named 'pojang_resorter' and, as part of the post-installation process, take a screenshot of the user's screen and send it to a specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the screen via ImageGrab.grab() and user environment during installation (e.g., reading 'README.md'). It also uses the 'requests' library to perform an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the HTTP POST request to the Discord webhook URL, which transmits an image (the screenshot) and a message payload. It could potentially leak screen content and other data if misused.",
  "flows": "The flow begins with the package installation, triggering 'post_install()' which captures a screenshot and sends it via HTTP POST to the webhook URL. Data flows from the screen capture (source) through image encoding into the HTTP request (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically captures and uploads a screenshot immediately upon installation without user consent, which is unusual behavior for a package. Hardcoded webhook URL is suspicious as it indicates data exfiltration. The 'print' statements do not warn the user about data sharing. The package's purpose involves privacy-sensitive operations.",
  "analysis": "The script performs an unexpected action during installation—taking a screenshot of the user's display and sending it to an external server via a webhook. This behavior constitutes potential privacy violation and data exfiltration. The code uses standard libraries and external dependencies but combines them in a way that could be malicious, especially since no user consent is requested. The hardcoded webhook URL indicates possible malicious intent to collect user data remotely. The overall flow suggests the code's purpose is to secretly collect visual data from the user's screen during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by capturing and transmitting a screenshot without user consent, which constitutes a privacy violation and potential data exfiltration. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL further raises suspicion of malicious intent. The package's functionality should be flagged for security review before use.",
