{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to define a Python package setup that, upon installation, takes a screenshot and sends it to a specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads the webhook URL from a hardcoded string. It also uses 'ImageGrab.grab()' to capture a screenshot, and 'requests.post()' to send data over the network.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.post()' function acts as a sink where data (the screenshot file and message payload) is sent to an external URL, which could be malicious if the URL is suspicious.",
  "flows": "The source 'WEBHOOK_URL' is used directly in 'requests.post' to send the screenshot. The screenshot is captured using 'ImageGrab.grab()', then saved into a buffer, and sent as a file attachment to the webhook. This data flow leaks the user's screen content to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an unexpected action during package installation: it captures a screenshot and sends it externally without user consent or notification. The webhook URL is hardcoded in the source code, which is suspicious and indicates potential malicious activity. The process occurs automatically during installation via a custom setup command, which is unusual behavior for a typical package.",
  "analysis": "The package setup defines a custom installation command that executes 'post_install()' after the standard install process. The 'post_install()' function takes a screenshot of the user's display using 'ImageGrab.grab()', then attempts to upload this image to a remote Discord webhook URL via an HTTP POST request. The URL is hardcoded, which indicates intent to exfiltrate data covertly. Such behavior is highly suspicious because it occurs automatically during installation, potentially without user awareness or consent. This functionality could be used maliciously for screen capturing and data exfiltration, constituting a privacy violation and potential malware activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by capturing and sending user screen data to an external server during package installation, without user consent. The hardcoded webhook URL and automatic execution make this highly suspicious. The overall security risk is high, and the behavior should be considered malicious or at least highly intrusive.",
