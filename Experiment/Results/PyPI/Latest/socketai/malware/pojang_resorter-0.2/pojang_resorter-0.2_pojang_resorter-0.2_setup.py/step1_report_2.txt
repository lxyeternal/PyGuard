{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to perform a standard setup and installation of a Python package named 'pojang_resorter'. Additionally, it takes a screenshot and sends it to a specified Discord webhook after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the environment during package installation, executes a screenshot capture via ImageGrab.grab(), and makes an HTTP POST request to a remote Discord webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "The code sends a screenshot image file and a message payload via an HTTP POST request to the specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Source: post_install() captures the screenshot (source). The data (image and message) is sent over the network via requests.post() (sink). The flow is from screenshot capture to data transmission to Discord webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The code captures a screenshot using ImageGrab and immediately uploads it to an external webhook upon installation, which is unusual behavior for a package installer. The webhook URL is hardcoded in the script, potentially indicating malicious intent. No validation or user consent is obtained before data transmission. The code runs during the installation process without explicit user approval.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup script augmented with a post-install hook that captures the user's screen and sends the image to a remote server. The process involves reading the environment, taking a screenshot, and sending it via an HTTP POST request. The use of ImageGrab and requests for network communication is straightforward. The key concern is the hardcoded webhook URL and automatic data exfiltration during package installation without user consent. This pattern resembles malicious behavior, as it secretly collects sensitive visual data and transmits it externally. The code does not appear to obfuscate or hide its intent but performs potentially invasive actions immediately after installation, which is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by capturing and transmitting a screenshot to an external server during package installation without user approval. The hardcoded webhook URL further indicates possible data exfiltration or spying activity. This is consistent with malicious or highly invasive behavior rather than legitimate package functionality.",
