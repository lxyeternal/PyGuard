  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'spiderxr_ai'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package metadata, dependencies, and content from setup parameters, including reading 'README.md' for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data or untrusted input handling occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading static package information and the contents of 'README.md' into the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The use of open('README.md').read() without explicit error handling could be a minor concern but is common in setup scripts. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging. It reads package metadata, dependencies, and documentation from static sources. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. No malicious behaviors, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are evident. The code appears clean, straightforward, and typical of Python packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
