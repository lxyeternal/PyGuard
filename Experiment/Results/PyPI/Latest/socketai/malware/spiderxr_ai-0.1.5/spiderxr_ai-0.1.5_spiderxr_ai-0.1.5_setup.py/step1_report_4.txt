  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library named 'spiderxr_ai'.",
  "sources": "Reads package requirements, README file for long description, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; standard setup process.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content during package setup; uses find_packages() to identify modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup procedure for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies (none listed), and reads the README.md file for the long description. All code aligns with typical package setup scripts. No obfuscated or malicious behavior detected. No external data is being transmitted or manipulated beyond standard package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
