{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'spiderxr_ai'.",
  "sources": "User input (e.g., setup parameters), reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "Potentially reading 'README.md' content could be exploited if the file content is malicious or maliciously modified, but in the context of setup, this is standard.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-supplied setup parameters and the 'README.md' file into the package configuration; no untrusted input flows into sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with no suspicious code, dynamic execution, or external data handling beyond reading a static file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' to define package metadata and configuration. It uses 'find_packages()' to automatically discover packages and reads the 'README.md' file for a detailed description. No user input, environment variables, or external data are processed during runtime. The script performs typical package setup tasks without any suspicious or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs common package configuration tasks safely.",
