  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No untrusted data, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code reads 'README.md' without error handling, but this is common in setup scripts and not inherently malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The only minor concern noted is the unguarded `open('README.md').read()` which could raise an exception if the file is missing, but this is standard practice and not malicious.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, likely reflecting the minor risk of unhandled file reading errors, but not indicating malicious intent.\n\n**Scores Review & Justification:**\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are appropriately low given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n- The one report with a 0.1 security risk score seems to overstate the concern; it's a very minor issue rather than a security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Based on all reports, the code is benign, typical of Python package setup scripts.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The minimal concern about reading 'README.md' without error handling does not constitute a security risk.\n\nPlease let me know if further detailed analysis is needed.",
