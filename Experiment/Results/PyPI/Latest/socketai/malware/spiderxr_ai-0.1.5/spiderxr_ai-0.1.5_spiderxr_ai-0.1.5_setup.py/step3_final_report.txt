  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and read the README.md for long description.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file manipulation beyond reading a local file.",
  "flows": "Static data from setup parameters and reading 'README.md' into long_description.",
  "anomalies": "Unprotected open('README.md').read() without error handling, but this is common in setup scripts and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It uses standard practices, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The only minor concern is the unguarded file read, which does not pose a security risk. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score should be 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The minimal concern about reading 'README.md' without error handling does not constitute a security risk.",
