  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'spiderxr_ai' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads package information from the setup() parameters, including package name, version, description, author info, and README content.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data affects system security or leaks occur; the code mainly prepares package metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code is declarative setup configuration without data flow from external sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' modules to define package setup parameters. It reads the long description from 'README.md', specifies package metadata, dependencies (none), and compatibility info. There are no input validation or dynamic execution patterns. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
