      "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant security and privacy weaknesses, including hardcoded secrets and unvalidated user inputs, which could be exploited for data leakage or misuse. However, there is no evidence of active malware, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The overall malware score should be low, with a moderate to high security risk due to external endpoints and credential handling."
