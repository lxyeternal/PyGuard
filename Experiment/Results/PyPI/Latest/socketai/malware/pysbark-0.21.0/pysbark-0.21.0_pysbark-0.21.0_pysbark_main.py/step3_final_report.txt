  "purpose": "Retrieve current user's login name and hostname, concatenate into a string.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.uname().nodename",
  "sinks": "None; no data transmission, storage, or output",
  "flows": "Source functions called in get_encoded_user_host() to produce a string; no external data flow",
  "anomalies": "Unused imports (subprocess, base64); function name suggests encoding but no encoding performed",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules but only retrieves system info without malicious activity. The function name implies encoding, but no encoding occurs, indicating possible incomplete implementation or misleading naming. No data leaks, command execution, or malicious patterns are present. The unused imports are benign but suggest potential for future extension or oversight.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple system info retrieval with no malicious intent. Minor anomalies include unused imports and a misleading function name, but these do not pose security risks.",
