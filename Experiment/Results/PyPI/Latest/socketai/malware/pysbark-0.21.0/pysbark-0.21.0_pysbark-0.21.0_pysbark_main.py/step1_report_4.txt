{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves the current system user's login name and the hostname of the machine, concatenates them into a string, and returns it.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current user login via os.getlogin() and system hostname via os.uname().nodename.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present that process untrusted data for output, storage, or network transmission.",
  "flows": "The data flows from source functions (os.getlogin() and os.uname()) into a formatted string, but the data is only returned and not transmitted or stored.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports unnecessary modules (subprocess, base64) which are not used. It appears to gather system info but does nothing further. No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script collects username and hostname information using standard OS functions. The imports of subprocess and base64 are unused, suggesting either incomplete code or unnecessary dependencies. No data is transmitted, stored insecurely, or manipulated maliciously. The function simply returns the concatenated user and hostname string. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving only to retrieve and return system user and hostname information with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. The presence of unused imports is a minor inefficiency but not malicious.",
