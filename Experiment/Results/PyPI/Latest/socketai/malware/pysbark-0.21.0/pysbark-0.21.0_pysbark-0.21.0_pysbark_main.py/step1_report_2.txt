  "purpose": "Retrieve the current user's login name and system hostname and combine them into a string.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.uname().nodename",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no output or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user login, system hostname) used to generate a string, with no further processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports 'subprocess' and 'base64' modules but does not use them, indicating potential leftover or unused code. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to get the current user's login name and system hostname, combining them into a string. It then calls this function in the main block. The unused imports of 'subprocess' and 'base64' could suggest incomplete or obfuscated code, but there is no active malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity. The code simply reads system information and does not send or store it elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, primarily retrieving system information without malicious intent or malicious behavior. The unused imports are likely harmless but could suggest code that was intended to do more. Overall, no malicious activity detected.",
