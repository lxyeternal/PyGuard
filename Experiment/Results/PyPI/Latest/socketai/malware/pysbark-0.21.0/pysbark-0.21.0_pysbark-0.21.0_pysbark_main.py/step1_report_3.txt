  "purpose": "Retrieve the current user's login name and the hostname of the system.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin() and os.uname().nodename",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the data is used locally within the function.",
  "flows": "Input from system calls (getlogin, uname) flows into string formatting to produce user_host.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports 'subprocess' and 'base64' modules but does not use them; this may indicate incomplete code or obfuscation. No sensitive data or malicious actions are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to get the current username and hostname, then returns this combined string. The unused imports ('subprocess' and 'base64') could suggest intentions for further data processing or exfiltration, but as it stands, they are inactive. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code. It simply retrieves system information and prints it if called, which is generally benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and benign, primarily gathering system information without any malicious behavior. The unused imports may indicate incomplete implementation but do not pose a security threat in their current state.",
