  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose is unclear due to the lack of context and minimal comments.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user inputs, environment variables, or imported modules, but specific input sources are not explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into variable assignments, function calls, or output functions; potential sinks include network requests, file operations, or system calls, but none are explicitly identified as suspicious.",
  "flows": "Data from sources flows through functions and variables without evident malicious manipulations or suspicious transfers to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. No unusual code constructs or dynamic code execution are evident. The code lacks comments, making intent unclear, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and does not contain any obvious malicious constructs such as network connections, system modifications, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a benign utility or processing script. Due to the absence of detailed operations, no suspicious behaviors are evident. The lack of comments and context prevents definitive conclusions, but there are no signs of malware or malicious intent present in the visible code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code seems benign, but limited context reduces confidence in this assessment. No supply chain attacks or malicious activities are apparent.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
