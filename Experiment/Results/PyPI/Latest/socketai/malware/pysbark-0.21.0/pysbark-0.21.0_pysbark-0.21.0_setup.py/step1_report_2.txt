  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that performs a network lookup involving the current system's user and hostname information during package installation.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.uname().nodename",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run with shell=True executing an external command",
  "flows": "Gather user and hostname info -> encode in base64 -> construct nslookup command -> execute command via subprocess",
  "anomalies": "The code encodes user and hostname data and sends it via nslookup to a suspicious domain, which could be used for tracking or data exfiltration. Use of shell=True with constructed command may allow command injection if data were untrusted, though here data appears controlled. The purpose of this behavior is unusual for a package installer.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to execute a network lookup to a suspicious domain, passing encoded user and hostname info. The information is encoded in base64, possibly to obfuscate the data. The subprocess call with shell=True is a security concern, as it could allow command injection if input data were malicious, but in this context, the data comes from system calls. The behavior suggests tracking or malicious exfiltration of environment data during installation. There is no other malicious code or backdoor present. The overall structure indicates an attempt to stealthily communicate system information to an external server.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an unusual and potentially malicious action by sending system information to an external server during package installation, which is suspicious behavior. This could be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration. No other malicious code or backdoors are detected. The behavior warrants caution before using this package.",
