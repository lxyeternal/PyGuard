{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package 'pysbark' with a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment data via os.getlogin() and os.uname().nodename.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run() executes a command that includes an encoded string, potentially leading to network communication with a suspicious domain.",
  "flows": "Environment data (user and hostname) are encoded and embedded into a command that makes a network request to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding of environment data and executing a network lookup command during installation without user consent. The domain 'oast.live' is commonly used in security testing and reconnaissance.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the 'install' command of setuptools to run a custom method. This method gathers the current user's login and hostname, encodes this information in base64, and constructs a shell command to perform an nslookup query to a suspicious domain, redirecting output to /dev/null. This network activity occurs during package installation, which could be malicious or used for tracking or data exfiltration. The domain used is a known security testing domain, indicating potential malicious intent or at least malicious-like behavior. No other malicious actions, such as file manipulation or privilege escalation, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs hidden network communication during package installation by sending encoded environment data to a suspicious domain. This behavior suggests malicious intent or covert data exfiltration, violating typical package installation norms. Overall, the code exhibits high malicious behavior potential.",
