  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential through covert system info exfiltration during installation, contacting a suspicious domain, and executing network commands insecurely. The behavior justifies high malware and security risk scores, with minimal obfuscation. It should be flagged as malicious or highly suspicious."
