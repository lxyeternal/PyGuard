  "purpose": "The script customizes the installation process of a Python package, executing a network request during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system information via os.getlogin() and os.uname().nodename.",
  "sinks": "Executing a shell command with subprocess.run(), sending encoded data to a remote domain.",
  "flows": "Source: os.getlogin() and os.uname().nodename -> Encode with base64 -> Form nslookup command with encoded data -> subprocess.run executes command which contacts remote domain.",
  "anomalies": "Uses shell=True in subprocess, which can be unsafe; encodes system info and queries a suspicious domain; no legitimate purpose apparent for this network request. The use of f-strings with system info and base64 encoding before network lookup is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that retrieves system login and hostname information, encodes this data in base64, and performs a DNS lookup query to a potentially malicious or tracking domain (oast.live). This network request occurs during package installation, which is atypical behavior for legitimate packages. The use of shell=True increases the risk of command injection, though in this context, the command is constructed from controlled variables. The code appears designed to send system identification data to an external server, likely for tracking or malicious purposes. The overall structure suggests an attempt to hide or obfuscate network activity, though it is straightforward in implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by executing a network request during installation that transmits system info to an external domain. This behavior indicates potential tracking or data exfiltration. The use of encoded system data and DNS lookup to a suspicious domain during install is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
