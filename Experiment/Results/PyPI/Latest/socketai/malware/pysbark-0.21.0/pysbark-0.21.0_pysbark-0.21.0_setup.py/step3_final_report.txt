{
  "purpose": "The code gathers system info, encodes it, and performs a DNS lookup to a suspicious domain during package installation, indicating malicious or covert data exfiltration activity.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.uname().nodename",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing 'nslookup' with encoded data to a suspicious domain",
  "flows": "system info retrieved -> base64 encoded -> inserted into nslookup command -> executed via subprocess.run()",
  "anomalies": "Execution of network request during install, use of shell=True, encoding system info before DNS query, contacting a known suspicious domain (oast.live)",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves system login and hostname, encodes this info with base64, and constructs a shell command to perform an nslookup to a suspicious domain. It runs this command with subprocess.run() using shell=True, which is insecure. The DNS query to oast.live, a domain associated with security testing and reconnaissance, indicates covert data exfiltration or tracking. The code's behavior during package installation is unusual and suspicious, with potential malicious intent. The use of base64 is minimal obfuscation. The network activity and contact with a suspicious domain justify high malware and security risk scores. The code does not contain active payloads but performs covert data transmission, which is characteristic of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential through covert system info exfiltration during installation, contacting a suspicious domain, and executing network commands insecurely. The behavior justifies high malware and security risk scores, with minimal obfuscation. It should be flagged as malicious or highly suspicious.",
