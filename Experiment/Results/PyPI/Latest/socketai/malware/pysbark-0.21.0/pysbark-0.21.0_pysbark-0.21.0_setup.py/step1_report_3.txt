  "purpose": "Customize the installation process of a Python package to include executing a network request based on system information.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.uname().nodename",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing a shell command that makes an external network request",
  "flows": "system info (user and hostname) -> base64 encoding -> command string -> subprocess.run() (shell command) -> network request to external domain",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding on system info, executing shell command with encoded data, sending data to a suspicious external domain, and running during installation process",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that gathers current user login and hostname, encodes this information in base64, and constructs a shell command that performs an nslookup on a seemingly random domain, redirecting output to /dev/null. This command is executed during package installation via subprocess.run with shell=True, which poses a security risk. The external domain appears suspicious and may be used for data exfiltration or tracking. The rest of the setup script is standard. The use of encoded system info in a network request during install is indicative of malicious intent or tracking behavior, especially given the suspicious domain name.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior involving gathering system info, encoding it, and sending it to a suspicious external server during package installation. This could be used for tracking, data exfiltration, or malicious command and control communication. The overall security risk is high.",
