  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package named 'pysbark' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.uname().nodename, base64.b64encode()",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() with shell=True executing a network lookup command",
  "flows": "user_host (from system info) -> base64 encoding -> command string -> subprocess.run() -> network request",
  "anomalies": "The subprocess command encodes system info in base64 and makes a network request to a suspicious domain without clear legitimate purpose. The use of shell=True with a dynamically constructed command is risky. The domain 'oast.live' suggests a potential data exfiltration or command-and-control activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during package installation, gathers system login and hostname information, encodes it in base64, and performs a DNS lookup query to a domain under 'oast.live'. This behavior is unusual for a package setup script and indicates possible data exfiltration or reconnaissance. The use of subprocess with shell=True enhances risk by executing constructed commands without sanitization. The rest of the code is standard setup configuration with no other suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains a suspicious network call during installation that encodes system information and contacts a potentially malicious domain. This behavior strongly suggests malicious intent or at least malicious activity. The code appears designed to stealthily send system info to an external server, indicating high risk.",
