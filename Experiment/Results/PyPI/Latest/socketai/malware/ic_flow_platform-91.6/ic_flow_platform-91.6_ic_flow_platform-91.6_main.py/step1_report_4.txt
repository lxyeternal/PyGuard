{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it encoded to multiple external URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system interfaces, hardcoded URLs",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending data over the network",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) collected and encoded, then transmitted to external URLs via URL parameters",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple system-specific commands to retrieve MAC addresses, obfuscation of MAC addresses via base64, multiple external URLs with potential malicious or suspicious domains, no response handling beyond silent pass, no validation or encryption of data, hardcoded URLs and parameters, no user consent or notice",
  "analysis": "The code gathers various system identifiers, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and transmits this information to several external domains. The URLs used are suspicious and potentially malicious, indicating possible data exfiltration or tracking. No authentication or encryption beyond base64 encoding is used. The network requests are silent and do not log responses, which could hide malicious activity. The retrieval of MAC addresses using system-specific commands can be used for fingerprinting. Overall, the script appears designed to collect and send system data without user awareness, fitting characteristics of a tracking or malicious data exfiltration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration, given its collection of system information and transmission to suspicious domains without user consent. It does not contain direct malware payloads but exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious surveillance or spyware activities.",
