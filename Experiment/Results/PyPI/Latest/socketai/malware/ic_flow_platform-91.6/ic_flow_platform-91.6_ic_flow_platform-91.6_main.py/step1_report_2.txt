{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs with encoded MAC addresses.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which reads network interface data.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send data to external URLs with query parameters.",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, current_path, mac_addresses) are encoded and included as URL parameters, then sent over HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs used for data exfiltration appear suspicious, possibly malicious C2 or tracking servers. The MAC addresses are base64-encoded before transmission, which could obscure their content but is not inherently malicious. No explicit hardcoded credentials are found, but the URLs and data collection suggest potential privacy violations.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system identifiers such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and transmits these, along with hostname, username, and directory, to three suspicious external domains via HTTP GET requests. The use of multiple URLs and encoding could be attempts to exfiltrate data covertly. No malware payloads like file operations, command execution, or network backdoors are evident. The data flow from system info collection to external communication indicates potential privacy or security risks, particularly if these domains are malicious or unknown. The code does not perform any malicious actions like system modification or data theft beyond information exfiltration, but its intent and connection to suspicious URLs raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed to collect system info and send it to external, suspicious URLs, indicating potential data exfiltration or tracking activity. It does not contain direct malware but poses privacy risks. The use of obscure URLs and encoding suggests covert data transmission, warranting caution.",
