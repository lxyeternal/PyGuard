      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The pattern warrants caution and further inspection of 'main.py'. The scores should reflect the potential for malicious activity, with malware risk around 0.6-0.7 and overall security risk around 0.7, considering the high impact of executing arbitrary code during installation."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior to suspicious domains, indicating malicious intent related to privacy invasion and potential spyware activity. No active malicious payloads are detected, but the behavior warrants high security concern. The malware score should be adjusted to reflect malicious intent without active payloads, and the overall risk remains high due to privacy implications."
