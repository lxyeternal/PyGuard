  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The pattern warrants caution and further inspection of 'main.py'. The scores should reflect the potential for malicious activity, with malware risk around 0.6-0.7 and overall security risk around 0.7, considering the high impact of executing arbitrary code during installation."
