  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration with a custom installation step that runs a function from 'main'.",
  "sources": "The 'from main import main' statement within the 'run' method of the custom 'CrazyInstallStrat' class.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of 'main()' during installation, which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the custom 'run' method imports and executes 'main()' from 'main' module.",
  "anomalies": "The 'run' method executes 'main()' without any apparent validation or restriction; no indication of malicious intent but executing arbitrary code during setup is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that extends the standard 'install'. During installation, it calls 'main()' from a module named 'main'. This behavior means that any code within 'main()' will run automatically when the package is installed. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or network connections present. The potential concern is that executing 'main()' during setup could perform arbitrary actions, possibly malicious if 'main()' contains malicious code. The setup dependencies and structure appear normal, but the execution of 'main()' during install is unusual and warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script runs a function 'main()' from the 'main' module during installation. This could execute arbitrary code at install time, which is suspicious. Without inspecting 'main.py', the maliciousness cannot be fully confirmed, but executing code during setup is a notable risk.",
