  "conclusion": "The setup script exhibits a high-risk pattern by executing external code during installation without validation, which could be exploited for malicious purposes. While no malicious code is explicitly present in the script, the pattern itself warrants a high suspicion level. Therefore, the malware score should be set around 0.7, and the security risk score should be approximately 0.75 to accurately reflect the potential danger."
