  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs encoded in base64, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() (which runs system commands to retrieve MAC addresses), and random.randint().",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with URL parameters containing system info; data is encoded in base64 but directly sent over HTTP GET requests.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are encoded and appended as URL parameters, then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external domains; no input validation or security controls are applied.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs with suspicious domain names, base64 encoding of MAC addresses (possibly for obfuscation), collection of system identifiers, and network requests without validation or encryption. The URLs are associated with domains that appear to be suspicious or obfuscated. No user interaction or obvious benign purpose detected.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system data including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses by executing system-specific commands. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, likely to obfuscate the raw data. It constructs URLs with these parameters, using a random number as a query parameter, and sends HTTP GET requests to external, suspicious-looking domains. The data flow suggests the script is exfiltrating system identifiers, possibly for tracking or malicious purposes. No obvious malicious payload or backdoor is present, but the behavior resembles data harvesting and transmission to potentially malicious endpoints, which can be considered suspicious and potentially malicious depending on context.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects and transmits system identifiers to external domains without encryption or user consent, which is suspicious. The obfuscation of MAC addresses and communication with suspicious URLs indicates potential malicious intent, such as tracking or data exfiltration. Although no active malicious payload like malware or backdoors is detected, the overall behavior is risky and should be flagged for review.",
