  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to remote URLs with encoded MAC addresses.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which runs system commands to retrieve MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send HTTP requests with collected data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) -> Data encoding (base64) -> URL parameter construction -> HTTP GET request to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of system commands to retrieve MAC addresses could be exploited if malicious inputs are introduced, but here they are from system info. The URLs are hardcoded and suspicious, pointing to potentially malicious domains. No user input is directly involved in URL construction; data is internal.",
  "analysis": "The script collects MAC addresses by executing system commands based on OS type, gathers hostname, username, current directory, and generates a random number. It encodes MAC addresses with base64, then constructs URLs to send this info as URL parameters to three external domains, likely for tracking or exfiltration. The URLs are suspicious, possibly malicious domains. The data transmission appears to be covert, with no explicit user consent or encryption other than URL encoding. The code does not perform any harmful actions on the system, but it exfiltrates sensitive system info. No obfuscation or malicious code execution is present. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for covertly collecting and transmitting system information to suspicious external servers. While it does not execute malicious payloads or harm the system directly, it poses privacy and security risks by potentially enabling unauthorized tracking or data exfiltration. The URL patterns suggest malicious intent.",
