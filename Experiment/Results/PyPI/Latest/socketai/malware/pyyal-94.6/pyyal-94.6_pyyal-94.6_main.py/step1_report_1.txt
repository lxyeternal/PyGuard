  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data to external URLs as encoded parameters.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system-specific network info, random.randint() generating a random number, and base64 encoding of MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() making HTTP requests to external URLs with system data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info and encoded MAC addresses are gathered, URL parameters are constructed, then requests are sent to multiple external servers with these parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code contacts suspicious external domains, encodes system identifiers, and silently performs network communication without clear purpose. It also uses random numbers in URL paths, which may obscure activity or tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system data (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and encodes the MAC addresses with base64. It then constructs URLs with these parameters and a random number, sending requests to potentially malicious or suspicious external servers. The domains appear suspicious and may be used for data exfiltration or tracking. The network requests are silent and do not provide feedback or validation. No malicious code such as backdoors, data theft, or system damage is evident beyond data collection and transmission. The communication to external servers with system data suggests possible privacy invasion or unauthorized tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to gather system information and send it to external domains, which are suspicious. While it does not perform destructive actions, the privacy implications and potential for covert data exfiltration are concerning. It exhibits behaviors typical of tracking or reconnaissance malware, though no explicit malicious payload is present.",
