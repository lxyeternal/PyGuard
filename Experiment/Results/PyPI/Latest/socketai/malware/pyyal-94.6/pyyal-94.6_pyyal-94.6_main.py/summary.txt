  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of reconnaissance or tracking malware—collecting system info and exfiltrating it to suspicious domains silently. While no active malicious payloads are evident, the privacy invasion and covert data transmission warrant a moderate to high security concern. The malware score should be modest (~0.2–0.3), but the overall security risk should be elevated (~0.7) due to privacy implications. The code is not obfuscated beyond base64 encoding, so the obfuscated score remains zero."
