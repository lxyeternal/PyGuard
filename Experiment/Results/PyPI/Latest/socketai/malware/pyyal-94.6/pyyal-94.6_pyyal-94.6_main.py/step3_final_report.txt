  "purpose": "The code collects system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes and transmits this data to external suspicious URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function, random.randint(), base64 encoding, urllib.parse.urlencode",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with constructed query parameters",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) flows into URL parameters, which are then sent via HTTP GET requests to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious external domains, silent exception handling during network requests, base64 encoding of MAC addresses as a mild obfuscation, no user consent prompts, no validation of external URLs",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system identifiers and network info, encodes MAC addresses with base64, and silently sends this data to multiple suspicious domains. The behavior indicates potential privacy invasion and covert data exfiltration. No malicious payloads such as destructive code, backdoors, or data theft are present. The network requests are silent, and the external domains are suspicious, raising privacy and security concerns. The code structure is straightforward, with minimal obfuscation. The malware score should reflect the suspicion but not active malicious payloads, and the security risk should account for privacy invasion and exfiltration potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of reconnaissance or tracking malware—collecting system info and exfiltrating it to suspicious domains silently. While no active malicious payloads are evident, the privacy invasion and covert data transmission warrant a moderate to high security concern. The malware score should be modest (~0.2–0.3), but the overall security risk should be elevated (~0.7) due to privacy implications. The code is not obfuscated beyond base64 encoding, so the obfuscated score remains zero.",
