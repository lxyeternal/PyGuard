  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes a main function post-installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules ('setuptools', 'requests', 'psutil') and dynamically imports 'main' from 'main' during installation.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' in the custom 'run' method of 'CrazyInstallStrat', executed during installation.",
  "flows": "After package installation, 'main()' from 'main' is invoked, which could potentially execute arbitrary or malicious code if 'main' contains malicious logic.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of a custom install command that triggers code execution ('main()') during installation. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present. The class name 'CrazyInstallStrat' is suspiciously informal, suggesting malicious intent or an attempt to hide behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with minimal information. It defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, after performing the standard installation steps, imports and executes 'main()' from a module called 'main'. This post-install execution could be used to run arbitrary code, which is a common tactic for malicious package behavior. The package dependencies are standard ('requests', 'psutil'), which are not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no explicit malicious activity are directly evident from this script alone, but the pattern of executing code during installation is unusual and potentially dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script with a custom install command that executes 'main()' during installation. While this behavior alone is not definitively malicious, it is suspicious because it can be exploited to run arbitrary code during package installation. The use of a non-standard class name and the automatic execution of 'main()' raise security concerns about potential malicious intent.",
