  "conclusion": "The code executes external 'main()' during setup, which is a significant security concern and potentially malicious. The pattern aligns with supply chain attack techniques. While the actual maliciousness depends on 'main()' content, the behavior warrants high suspicion and caution. The scores should be set accordingly, with malware around 0.6-0.75 and security risk at 0.75 or higher."
