  "purpose": "This setup script defines the package configuration and a custom installation process that executes a function from an external module during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own configuration data, imports 'main' from an external module during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function from 'main' module during install, potential for that function to perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The install process runs, then imports and executes 'main()' from 'main', which could perform any action.",
  "anomalies": "The custom 'CrazyInstallStrat' class executes code from 'main' module during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a Python package with specified dependencies. The notable aspect is the custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the run method to call 'main()' from a 'main' module during installation. This behavior is unconventional and could be exploited to execute arbitrary code during package installation, a common tactic in supply chain attacks. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The 'main' module is external and not included in this snippet, so its behavior cannot be assessed, but executing external code during setup is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious behavior by executing an external 'main' function during installation, which could be exploited to perform malicious actions on the host system. While the setup appears standard, the invocation of external code during install is suspicious and warrants further review of the 'main' module.",
