  "purpose": "Collect system information (host name, user name, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to a set of remote URLs encoded in base64 and URL parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), MAC addresses (get_mac_addresses function), random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Uses urllib.request.urlopen to send GET requests with system info to remote servers, potentially leaking sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses, random number) is encoded (MAC addresses) and appended as URL parameters. Data flows from sources through encoding to URLs, then sent via HTTP GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs pointing to suspicious domains; encoding MAC addresses in base64 and sending over network could be used for tracking or exfiltration. The code does not process responses, indicating possible data collection without response handling.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes MAC addresses in base64 and constructs URLs with these parameters along with a random number. The URLs appear suspicious, possibly for tracking or command-and-control purposes. The network requests are made silently without validation or response processing, indicating potential data exfiltration. The code does not contain obfuscated code or hidden backdoors, but the use of external URLs and collection of MAC addresses raises privacy concerns. Overall, it appears designed for tracking or data collection, possibly malicious depending on context.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects system identifiers and sends them to suspicious remote servers without user consent. While technically simple, the purpose and behavior suggest tracking or data exfiltration. No malware such as backdoors or destructive actions is present, but the privacy-invasive data transmission warrants caution.",
