  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data to multiple external URLs encoded in Base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network info, base64 encoding MAC addresses, and the URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen calls with constructed URLs that include system info as query parameters, which are sent over the network.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered from sources, encoded, and then included as URL parameters in HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with non-descriptive domains, encoding MAC addresses in Base64 before transmission, and sending potentially sensitive info (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) over HTTP (not secure). The list of URLs appears suspicious, and the encoding might be used to obfuscate the data. No explicit backdoors or malicious payloads are present, but the data collection and transmission are privacy-invasive.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers basic system information: hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses across different OSes. It encodes MAC addresses in Base64, which could be to obfuscate the data before transmission. The data is sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple suspicious URLs, possibly for fingerprinting or tracking. No malicious payloads or code injections are present. The use of external domains with generic and potentially malicious-looking subdomains indicates malicious intent, likely for tracking or exfiltration purposes. There are no indications of backdoors or direct malware behavior like system damage, but the data exfiltration aspect is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs privacy-invasive data collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains without user consent. It does not contain direct malware or backdoors but poses privacy and security risks due to unauthorized data transmission. The suspicious URLs and obfuscation suggest potential malicious intent in a broader threat context.",
