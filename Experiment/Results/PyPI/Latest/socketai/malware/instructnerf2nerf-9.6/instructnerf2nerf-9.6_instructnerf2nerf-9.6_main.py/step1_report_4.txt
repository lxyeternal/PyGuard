  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to specific external URLs encoded in base64, likely for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system MAC addresses",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending constructed URLs containing system data as parameters",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) -> Encoding (base64) -> URL parameter construction -> urlopen() request to external domains",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external domains possibly for command and control or data collection; encoding MAC addresses in base64 without clear purpose; sending data to multiple external URLs without any validation or response handling; minimal exception handling that suppresses all errors.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers sensitive system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, which are then encoded in base64. It constructs URLs pointing to potentially malicious or suspicious domains, appending the encoded data as URL parameters. It then makes HTTP requests to these URLs, likely to transmit the data. The code does not verify the responses or log errors meaningfully. The domain names and URL patterns are suspicious, and the data collection and transmission pattern resembles data exfiltration or tracking behavior. No obvious malicious payloads or backdoors are present, but the activity pattern suggests potential privacy violations or covert data collection. The code's behavior is consistent with a stealthy data harvesting or command-and-control beacon script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears designed to covertly collect system information and transmit it to external servers, which is characteristic of data exfiltration or tracking activities. No direct malware actions such as damaging files or executing arbitrary commands are present, but the suspicious domains and data collection method raise security concerns.",
