{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to external URLs encoded in base64, possibly for tracking or fingerprinting.",
  "sources": "Reading system info via platform, getpass, os, and subprocess modules; generating random number; encoding MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external URLs with system data as URL parameters via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "System info is collected, encoded, and included as URL parameters in GET requests to external servers, which are then invoked.",
  "anomalies": "The code communicates with multiple suspicious external domains, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and sends system info without user consent; no user prompts or safeguards. The URLs are suspicious and appear designed for tracking or exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hardware identifiers (MAC addresses) and system info such as hostname, username, and current directory. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then constructs URLs to send this data via GET requests. The external URLs are non-standard and appear malicious, possibly for tracking, fingerprinting, or command-and-control communication. No user consent is evident. The code does not perform any harmful system modifications but exfiltrates sensitive system info to potentially malicious servers. There are no obfuscation techniques used. The use of multiple suspicious URLs and data exfiltration indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system data and transmitting it to suspicious external domains without user consent. It appears designed for tracking or reconnaissance activities rather than benign functionality.",
