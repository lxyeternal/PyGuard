{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to external suspicious URLs, likely for covert data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network interfaces",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with system info as URL parameters",
  "flows": "Source functions (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), get_mac_addresses()) -> URL construction with encoded data -> HTTP GET requests to external domains",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious external domains, base64 encoding of MAC addresses for obfuscation, silent exception handling, no user notification or consent prompts",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system identifiers and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and transmits this data to multiple suspicious URLs via HTTP GET requests. No malicious payloads, destructive actions, or backdoors are present. The behavior indicates covert data exfiltration and privacy invasion. The URLs are non-descriptive and potentially malicious. The code lacks obfuscation beyond base64 encoding and does not contain malicious payloads or destructive code. Exception handling is silent, possibly to avoid detection. The primary concern is privacy invasion rather than active malware or payload delivery.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a privacy-invasive data collection and exfiltration script, not active malware. It poses significant security and privacy risks due to covertly transmitting system info to suspicious domains. The malware score should be adjusted downward to reflect the absence of malicious payloads, while the security risk score remains high due to privacy invasion. Overall, the activity warrants caution and further investigation but does not constitute traditional malware.",
