  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'pytkit' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static data within setup() parameters (name, version, author, description, packages)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or external data sources present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "Lack of meaningful description ('None' as description), but no malicious activity or anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata with static strings. No input handling, no code execution, no dynamic behavior, no suspicious code structures or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, no obfuscation. The simplicity and static nature imply no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
