  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata with static values.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings in setup() parameters (name, version, author, description, packages).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data used directly in setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with fixed parameters, indicating a static package configuration. No external data, user input, network activity, or code execution beyond static function call. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores reflecting no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities. No anomalies or hidden behaviors are present. The code aligns with best practices for static package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
