{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata and configuration for building and distributing the 'pytkit' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and package list from hardcoded values.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply sets up package configuration with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward package setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static metadata, which is standard practice for Python package configuration. No external input handling, data processing, or suspicious code structures are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate it is a typical setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It merely provides package metadata for distribution purposes.",
