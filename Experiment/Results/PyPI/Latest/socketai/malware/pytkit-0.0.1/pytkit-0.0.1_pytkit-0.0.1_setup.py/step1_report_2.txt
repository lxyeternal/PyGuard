{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for packaging the Python project named 'pytkit'.",
  "sources": "Reads package information such as name, version, author, description, and package list from the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only uses static data for package setup.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup parameters are static.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' module and calls 'setup()' with static, predefined package metadata. There are no dynamic inputs, external data sources, or suspicious code constructs. The setup parameters appear standard for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package setup script with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It solely provides static package metadata without any malicious code or suspicious behavior.",
