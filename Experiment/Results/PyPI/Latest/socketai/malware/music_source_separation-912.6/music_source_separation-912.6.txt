      "conclusion": "The setup process executes external code ('main()') during installation, which poses a significant security risk and could be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful instructions. The behavior is suspicious and warrants a high malware and security risk score, with scores around 0.8 and 0.75 respectively. The code is not obfuscated, but the pattern itself is dangerous in supply chain contexts."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert collection and transmission of system information to suspicious external domains, indicative of malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. It should be considered high risk, with a high likelihood of malicious intent, primarily due to data exfiltration activities. The code itself is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious."
