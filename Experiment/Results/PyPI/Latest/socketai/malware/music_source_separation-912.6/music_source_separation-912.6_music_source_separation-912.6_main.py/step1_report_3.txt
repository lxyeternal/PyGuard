  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, current directory) and send it to multiple URLs for monitoring or tracking purposes.",

  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, username, current_path) -> URL construction with parameters -> URL request via urllib.request.urlopen()",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple tracking URLs with obfuscated domain names, sending system info without user consent, use of random number in URL path, no explicit user interaction or validation",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, and current directory, then constructs URLs with these details along with a random number. It sends HTTP GET requests to several domains, which appear suspicious and potentially malicious or tracking-related. The use of obfuscated URLs and the lack of user consent, combined with system info exfiltration, indicate malicious intent. There is no validation or sanitization of data sent, and error handling is minimal. No malicious code execution or backdoors are evident, but the behavior resembles covert data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to perform covert collection and transmission of system information to suspicious domains, which could be used for tracking or malicious purposes. While it does not contain code injection or backdoors, its behavior raises security concerns due to unconsented data exfiltration and obfuscated URLs.",
