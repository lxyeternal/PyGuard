  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, current directory) and send it to multiple remote URLs as part of a telemetry or tracking operation.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() which sends data to external URLs",
  "flows": "system info sources → URL construction with query parameters → urlopen request to external domains",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external URLs possibly for data exfiltration, dynamic URL construction with random number, no explicit user consent, potential privacy violation",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, and current directory, then sends this information to three external URLs embedded within a loop. The URLs are obscure and may be used for tracking or data collection without user awareness. The use of a random number in the URL query parameter may serve as a tracking token or to avoid request blocking. No data validation or encryption is present. The code does not perform any malicious system modification but can be used for covert data exfiltration or tracking. No evidence of backdoors, malicious payloads, or harmful system modifications are present. The URLs seem suspicious and possibly malicious or used for clandestine monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The script gathers basic system info and transmits it to multiple potentially malicious or tracking-related domains, indicating a privacy concern or covert data collection. Although it does not contain explicit malware, its behavior aligns with tracking or exfiltration activities, warranting caution.",
