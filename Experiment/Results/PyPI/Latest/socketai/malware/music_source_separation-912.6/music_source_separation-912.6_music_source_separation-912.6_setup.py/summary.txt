  "conclusion": "The setup process executes external code ('main()') during installation, which poses a significant security risk and could be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful instructions. The behavior is suspicious and warrants a high malware and security risk score, with scores around 0.8 and 0.75 respectively. The code is not obfuscated, but the pattern itself is dangerous in supply chain contexts."
