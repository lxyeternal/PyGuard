  "sources": "Importing modules (setuptools, main), executing main() from main module during install",
  "sinks": "Calling main() function from main module during install process",
  "flows": "During installation, the CrazyInstallStrat.run() method executes, which imports main and calls main()",
  "anomalies": "Execution of main() during install without any visibility into what main() does; no safeguards or checks; no indication of the main module's behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class CrazyInstallStrat that runs the standard install process and then calls main() from the main module. The main() function is executed during package installation, which is unusual and potentially suspicious if main() contains malicious code. No validation or sandboxing is performed. The setup script itself appears standard, but the invocation of main() at install time could execute arbitrary code, posing a security risk if main() is malicious. The package requires only 'requests' as a dependency, which is common.",
  "conclusion": "The script executes a potentially arbitrary main() function during installation, which could be malicious if main() contains harmful code. This behavior warrants caution, as it allows code execution at install time without explicit user consent or validation.",
