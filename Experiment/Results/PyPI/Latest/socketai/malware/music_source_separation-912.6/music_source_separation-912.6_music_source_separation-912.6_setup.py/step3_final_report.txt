{
  "purpose": "The setup script executes a custom install class that, during installation, imports and runs the 'main()' function from a local module, potentially executing arbitrary code at install time.",
  "sources": "Importing 'main' from the local 'main' module during the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during installation, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if 'main()' contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "The run() method calls 'install.run(self)' followed by 'from main import main' and 'main()', creating a source-to-sink flow during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Executing external 'main()' during setup is unconventional and suspicious; no validation or sandboxing is performed before execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, after performing standard installation, imports and executes 'main()' from a local module. This pattern is unusual and introduces a supply chain security risk, as arbitrary code can run during package installation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.6-0.8, security risk around 0.6-0.75) are justified given the potential for malicious behavior. The code itself is straightforward and not obfuscated, but the behavior warrants caution. Without inspecting 'main()', the exact maliciousness cannot be confirmed, but the pattern is inherently risky.",
  "conclusion": "The setup process executes external code ('main()') during installation, which poses a significant security risk and could be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful instructions. The behavior is suspicious and warrants a high malware and security risk score, with scores around 0.8 and 0.75 respectively. The code is not obfuscated, but the pattern itself is dangerous in supply chain contexts.",
