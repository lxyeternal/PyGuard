  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'music_source_separation' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code imports from 'main' module within the 'run' method of a custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function from 'main' is called during installation, which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method executes, importing and calling 'main()' from 'main' module.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' executes code from 'main' during installation, which is unconventional and potentially malicious if 'main' is malicious or unintended.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes 'main()' from a local 'main' module. This behavior introduces a supply chain risk because it executes arbitrary code during package installation. The code does not specify where 'main' is defined, so it could contain malicious code or unwanted behavior. The code structure itself is standard for setup scripts, but the invocation of 'main()' during install is suspicious and could be exploited to run malicious code without the user's explicit consent. No other malicious or obfuscated code is present. The package dependencies are minimal and typical.",
  "conclusion": "The script executes code from the 'main' module during installation, which could be malicious or unwanted. This behavior raises supply chain security concerns, especially if the 'main' module contains harmful code. The rest of the code is standard for a setup script, but the execution of 'main()' at install time is a red flag.",
