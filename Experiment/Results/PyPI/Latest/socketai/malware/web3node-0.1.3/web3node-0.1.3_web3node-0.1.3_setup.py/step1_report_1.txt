{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to set up and install the 'web3node' Python package, including its dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ variable from 'web3node/__init__.py' to determine package version.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input; mainly involves static package setup information.",
  "flows": "The version string read from __init__.py flows into the setup() function for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. Uses a simple regex to extract version; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations. It conditionally imports 'setuptools' or falls back to 'distutils'. It extracts the package version via regex, which is common practice. The setup() call specifies package metadata and dependencies, all typical for Python package distribution. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, network communication, or backdoors. The list of dependencies includes common libraries, some of which could be misused if the package itself were malicious, but in this context, they are standard requirements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or malware. It follows standard practices and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code patterns.",
