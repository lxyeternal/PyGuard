{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up and package a Python project named 'web3node' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ variable from 'web3node/__init__.py' file; imports 'setuptools' or 'distutils'; reads version info from file.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setup()' to define package metadata and dependencies, which are standard in packaging; no sink that executes untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from file → passes data to setup() → completes package setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The inclusion of 'pyinstaller' in dependencies is typical for packaging but warrants attention if misused, though not inherently malicious here.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to extract the version number from 'web3node/__init__.py' using regex, which is a common pattern. It then proceeds to call setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All dependencies appear related to development and packaging, with no indicators of malicious intent. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity is present. The script functions solely as a package configuration script, not executing untrusted data or system commands.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs a standard package setup routine with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of common dependencies and the straightforward structure suggest it is legitimate and safe.",
