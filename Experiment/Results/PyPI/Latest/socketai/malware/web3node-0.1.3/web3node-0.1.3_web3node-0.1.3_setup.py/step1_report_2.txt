  "purpose": "Setup script for the web3node package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string from 'web3node/__init__.py' file.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external outputs beyond package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from file -> used in setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 're.search' to extract version is standard; no suspicious patterns. Package data includes common static files; no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks for a Python package, extracting version info via regex, and defining package metadata and dependencies. No code injection, malicious network activity, or suspicious code execution is present. The listed dependencies are common and do not inherently pose security risks. The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated parts. The overall structure is straightforward and consistent with standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The dependencies are typical for a web3-related package, and the code does not perform any suspicious actions.",
