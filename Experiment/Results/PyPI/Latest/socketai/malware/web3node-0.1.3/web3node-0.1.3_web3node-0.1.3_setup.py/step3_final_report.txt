  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for web3node project, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from 'web3node/__init__.py' using regex; imports setup functions from setuptools or distutils.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulation beyond standard setup.",
  "flows": "Version string extraction from file → setup() invocation with package info and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; use of regex for version extraction is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with straightforward logic. It performs version extraction via regex, handles import fallback, and calls setup() with package details. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation detected. Dependencies are common for packaging. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present. The regex-based version extraction is a common pattern and not risky. Overall, the script is benign and aligns with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
