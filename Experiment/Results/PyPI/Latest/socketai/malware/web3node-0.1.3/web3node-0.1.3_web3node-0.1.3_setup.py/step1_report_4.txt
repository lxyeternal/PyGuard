  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the web3node Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ variable from 'web3node/__init__.py' using regex.",
  "sinks": "The open() function reads a file; no untrusted input handling or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file -> assigns to __version__ -> used in setup() for package versioning.",
  "anomalies": "None apparent; straightforward setup script. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, extracts version info from a local file using regex, and runs setup() with package info and dependencies. All actions are typical for a Python package setup. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic detected. The dependencies include 'pyinstaller' and 'pynput', which are legitimate tools and libraries for development and input handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent. It correctly retrieves version info and specifies dependencies for packaging. No security risks identified.",
