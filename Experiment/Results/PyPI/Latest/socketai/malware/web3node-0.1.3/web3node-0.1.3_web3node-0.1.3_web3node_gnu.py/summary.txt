  "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple high-risk behaviors characteristic of malicious backdoors, including remote code execution, credential harvesting, privilege escalation, and persistence. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, with malware scores around 0.85-0.9 and security risk scores similarly high. Obfuscation is minimal. Overall, the code should be considered highly malicious and dangerous."
