{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts, then exfiltrates this data via a hardcoded Discord webhook, functioning as a malicious info-stealer.",
  "sources": [
    "Environment variables (e.g., APPDATA, LOCALAPPDATA, USERPROFILE)",
    "File system paths (e.g., leveldb files, login data, account JSON files)",
    "System commands (e.g., wmic for UUID, os.getlogin())",
    "Network requests (requests.get and requests.post)"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL",
    "Reading sensitive data (Discord tokens, passwords, account info)"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Sources (environment variables, files, system commands) collect data",
    "Data is processed and formatted within functions",
    "send_to_webhook() transmits the data via network request to the webhook URL"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration",
    "Collection of sensitive user data without consent",
    "Stealthy data harvesting without user awareness",
    "No user prompts or permissions requested"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward malicious activities: it gathers system info, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account details from local files and system commands. It then exfiltrates this data to a remote webhook. The code is not obfuscated, and uses standard libraries and system calls, indicating clear malicious intent. The data flows from various sources directly to the network sink without user consent or encryption, demonstrating high maliciousness and security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions as a high-severity malicious info-stealer, exfiltrating sensitive user data to an external server. It exhibits no obfuscation, and its activities pose a significant privacy and security threat.",
