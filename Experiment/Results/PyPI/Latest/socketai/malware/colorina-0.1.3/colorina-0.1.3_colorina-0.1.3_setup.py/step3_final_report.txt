  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for Python packaging using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools module.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "None; the code simply calls setup() with no arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Calling setup() without parameters is unusual but not malicious or risky; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard minimal setup script. It imports setup from setuptools and calls it with no arguments, which is common in package configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately zero, with a negligible exception in one report where a small security risk score (0.1) was assigned due to missing parameters, but this does not indicate actual risk. All reports are consistent and accurate in their benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. All scoring should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 for consistency and accuracy.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
