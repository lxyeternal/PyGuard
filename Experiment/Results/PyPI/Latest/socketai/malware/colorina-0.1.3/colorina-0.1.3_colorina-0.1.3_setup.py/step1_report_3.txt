  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from setuptools import setup' and the call to 'setup()'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'setuptools' as a source, followed by invocation of 'setup()' with no parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is minimal and follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from the 'setuptools' library and executes it with default parameters. This is a common pattern in Python package distribution. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or data leaks are present. The code does not perform any data processing or network operations. Its simplicity indicates standard packaging intent without malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
