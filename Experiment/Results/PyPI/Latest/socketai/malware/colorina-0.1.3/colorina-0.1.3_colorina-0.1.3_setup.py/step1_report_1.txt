  "purpose": "To configure and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; only static code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no potential leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code simply calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; very minimal code, standard usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls setup() with no arguments, which is a minimal and standard way to prepare a package. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors present. The code does not include any obfuscation or malicious patterns. It is a typical setup script for packaging Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, standard, and intended solely for package configuration. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
