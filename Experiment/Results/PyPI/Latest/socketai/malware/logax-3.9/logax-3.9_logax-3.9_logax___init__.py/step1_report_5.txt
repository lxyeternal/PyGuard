{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module named 'info' in the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from .info",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data output or external communication present",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; import is static, no runtime data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can lead to namespace pollution and obscure dependencies but is not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement importing everything from a local module named 'info'. This pattern is common in package modules to organize code. No data is processed, no external input or output occurs. There are no signs of suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code. The simplicity and lack of additional code or logic suggest low risk. The import may be used to access shared variables, functions, or classes within the package, but no malicious intent can be inferred solely from this statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no indications of malicious activity. The use of wildcard import is a code style concern but does not imply security risks. Overall, the snippet appears benign.",
