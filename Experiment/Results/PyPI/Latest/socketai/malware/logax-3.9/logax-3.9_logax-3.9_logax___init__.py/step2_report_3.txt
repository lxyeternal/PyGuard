  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .info import *`.\n   - This is a standard relative import statement in Python.\n   - There are no indications of runtime malicious activity, data exfiltration, or code execution within this line.\n   - The only potential concern is the use of a wildcard import, which can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious code if the 'info' module is malicious.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that this is a simple import statement.\n   - They acknowledge that without inspecting the 'info' module, the security implications are unknown.\n   - They mention the use of wildcard imports as a potential issue but not inherently malicious.\n   - No significant logical flaws are evident in the reports; they are cautious and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - **Confidence:** Ranges from 0.6 to 0.9, which seems appropriate given the limited context.\n   - **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the code's clarity.\n   - **Malware:** 0 in all reports, which aligns with the analysis that the line itself isn't malicious.\n   - **SecurityRisk:** Slightly low (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable for such a benign import statement.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - The import statement alone does not pose a significant security risk, but the potential for malicious code exists if the 'info' module is malicious.\n   - Since the reports do not assume malicious content within 'info', the low scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This is justified because the code snippet does not contain any malicious behavior.\n   - However, if the 'info' module is malicious, the malware could reside there, but that cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent.\n   - They correctly state that the actual security risk depends on the contents of 'info'.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The overall assessment indicates low risk and no malware.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code snippet is benign on its own.\n- The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which can obscure malicious or unintended behavior in the 'info' module.\n- Without inspecting 'info', the risk remains low but non-zero.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent with the reports; no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (the code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to the potential risk if 'info' is malicious, but not evident here)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe import statement itself is benign. The main security consideration hinges on the contents of the 'info' module, which is outside the scope of this snippet. The current scores are appropriate, but I would recommend maintaining a cautious stance and reviewing the 'info' module's contents before deploying or trusting this code in a security-sensitive environment.",
