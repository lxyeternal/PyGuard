  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports concern the same code snippet: `from .info import *`.\n- The code is a relative import of all symbols from a local module named 'info'.\n- No additional code or context is provided, so conclusions are based solely on this line.\n- Wildcard imports (`import *`) are generally discouraged because they obscure which symbols are imported and can potentially hide malicious or unintended code if the imported module is malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The import statement itself is syntactically correct and present in all reports.\n- No signs of malicious behavior (e.g., data exfiltration, code execution, network activity) are evident in this line alone.\n- The security risk is low based on this snippet, but the use of `import *` can be considered a code quality concern.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning:\n- **Overemphasis on the import line alone:** While the reports correctly state that the line itself is benign, they sometimes suggest that further review of the 'info' module is necessary. This is valid, but the current report should emphasize that without inspecting the 'info' module, the security implications cannot be fully assessed.\n- **Malware scoring:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity in this line. However, if the 'info' module is malicious, the import could bring in malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is reasonable given the straightforward import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Scores assessment and suggestions:\n- **Malware score:** Given only this line, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. However, if the 'info' module is malicious, the overall risk could be higher. Since the reports do not provide content of 'info', the malware score should remain at 0 but with a note that it depends on the module's contents.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly assigned as 0.\n- **Risk score:** The reports assign low risk scores (around 0.1-0.2), which is reasonable. Since the import is benign, but wildcard imports are discouraged, a slightly higher risk score could be justified if considering best practices, but not necessarily for security risk.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities in this line alone.\n- The use of `import *` can be considered a code quality issue but not a security risk.\n- Therefore, risk scores should remain low, around 0.1-0.2, unless further context indicates malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency check:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment that this line alone is benign.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.6-0.9), which is reasonable given the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1-0.2 (low, mainly due to use of wildcard import, not security risk)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.15 (reflecting minor code style concerns but no security risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe import statement is standard and not malicious. The primary concern is code clarity and maintainability due to the use of `import *`, but this does not constitute a security risk. The actual security posture depends on the contents of the 'info' module, which cannot be assessed from this snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Further review of the 'info' module is recommended to fully understand potential security implications.",
