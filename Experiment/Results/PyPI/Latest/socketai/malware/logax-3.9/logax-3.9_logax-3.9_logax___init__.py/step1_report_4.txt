{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'info', likely to use its functions, variables, or classes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'info'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink identified; no data is being processed or transmitted in this line.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow evident from this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .info import *' can be considered suspicious because it imports all contents from a module, which can hide malicious imports or unintended code execution, but by itself, this is not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code consists solely of an import statement that imports all members from a local module named 'info'. The statement alone does not execute any code nor does it perform any actions that could be malicious. However, import statements can sometimes hide malicious behavior if the 'info' module contains malicious code. Since the provided code only shows the import statement and no further context, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution and potential ambiguity, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is minimal and standard in Python projects, although it warrants further review of the 'info' module to ensure it does not contain malicious code. Overall, the risk level is low, but caution should be exercised if the contents of 'info' are unknown.",
