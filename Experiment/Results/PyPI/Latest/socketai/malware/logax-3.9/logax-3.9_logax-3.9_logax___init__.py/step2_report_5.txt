  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the validity of their conclusions, the scoring, and whether any inconsistencies or errors are present.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: `from .info import *`.\n- The code is a relative import of all symbols from a local module `info`.\n- None of the reports find any direct malicious activity or malware in this line.\n- The main concern raised is the use of wildcard import (`*`), which can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious code if the `info` module is malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues in the code:\n\n**Is the reported code present?**  \nYes, all reports analyze the same code snippet: `from .info import *`.  \n**Conclusion:** Confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning:\n\n- All reports correctly state that this line alone does not execute malicious code or data exfiltration.\n- They acknowledge that the risk depends on the contents of `info`, which is unknown.\n- They mention that wildcard imports are discouraged for clarity but are not inherently malicious.\n\n**Potential oversight:**  \nWhile the reports are generally accurate, they do not explicitly consider the possibility that the `info` module could contain malicious code that executes upon import (e.g., code at module level). However, since the import statement itself does not execute code beyond loading, this is a minor point. The real concern is whether the imported module is malicious, which cannot be determined from this line alone.\n\n**Conclusion:** No significant logical errors are evident in the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Review of scores:\n\n- **Confidence:** Ranges from 0.6 to 0.9, which seems reasonable given the limited context.\n- **Obfuscated:** All zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware:** All zero, consistent with the analysis that no malicious activity is visible in this line.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low risk.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes, given the context, the scores seem appropriate. The high confidence in benign nature aligns with the fact that the line is a simple import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- No scores above 0.5 are present, which is correct because the code itself is benign.\n- If any score were above 0.5, it would need justification due to potential maliciousness, but that is not the case here.\n\n---\n\n### Malware scores:\n\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified because the line itself does not perform any malicious activity.\n- The potential for malicious code depends on the contents of `info`, which is unknown, but the import statement alone is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n\n- The reports assume that wildcard imports are suspicious but not malicious. This is correct.\n- They do not assume that the act of importing `info` is malicious, which is also correct.\n- No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n- No contradictions are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and cautious.** They correctly identify that the code is benign but highlight the importance of reviewing the `info` module itself for malicious content.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\nGiven the analysis, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity in this import line.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward import statement.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, just caution about the contents of `info`.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nIf I were to consider the entire module or package, the risk might increase if the `info` module is malicious, but based solely on this line, the risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | My Estimate |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n| Malware         | 0            |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1          |\n\n**Final comment:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. No further action is needed unless the contents of `info` are reviewed and found malicious.",
