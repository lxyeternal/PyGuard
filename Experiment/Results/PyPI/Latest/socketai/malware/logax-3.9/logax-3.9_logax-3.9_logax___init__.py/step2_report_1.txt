  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code is a relative import, importing all symbols from the local module `info`.\n- Use of `import *` is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution, but it is not inherently malicious.\n- The import itself is static; no runtime data flows, network activity, or code execution are visible.\n- The actual security implications depend heavily on the contents of `info`, which are not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import all contents from `info`.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; further review needed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.7\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The low malware score aligns with the absence of malicious indicators. The confidence is moderate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Import all symbols/functions from `info`.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward, no malicious activity. Wildcard import is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The high confidence is justified given the simplicity. No change necessary.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Import all definitions from `info`.\n- **Analysis:** Wildcard import can hide malicious code but not malicious by itself.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.6\n\n**Assessment:**  \nReasonable. The risk score is low, as no malicious activity is evident. Slightly lower confidence could be justified, but it's acceptable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `info`.\n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning; no malicious activity visible.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.6\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent and reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `info`.\n- **Analysis:** Standard pattern, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the import line alone does not indicate malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** Low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and justified based on the provided analysis.\n- The high confidence in most reports aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The potential concern with wildcard imports is acknowledged but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily due to the use of wildcard import, which is a style concern but not a security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and well-justified. No modifications are necessary. The main security consideration is to review the contents of `info` to ensure it does not contain malicious code, but based solely on this import statement, the risk remains negligible.",
