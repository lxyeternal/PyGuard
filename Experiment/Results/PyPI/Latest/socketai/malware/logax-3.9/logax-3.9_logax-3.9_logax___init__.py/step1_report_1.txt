  "analysis": "This code simply imports all symbols from a local module named 'info'. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code execution, or backdoors within this single line. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious intent. The import could be benign or malicious depending on the contents of 'info', but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement with no immediate signs of malicious behavior. Further review of the 'info' module is necessary to fully assess security, but based solely on this line, there are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
