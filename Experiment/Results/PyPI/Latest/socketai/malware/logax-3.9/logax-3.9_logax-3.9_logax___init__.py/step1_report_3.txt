  "purpose": "Imports all definitions and objects from the 'info' module in the same package.",

  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources within this snippet; potential flow depends on imported module behavior",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can obscure which names are imported, potentially hiding malicious code or unintended behavior; no direct malicious activity observed in this line alone",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement, which pulls all symbols from the 'info' module. This pattern alone is common in Python packages and does not indicate malicious intent. However, wildcard imports can hide malicious or unsafe code within the imported module. Since only this import line is provided, no malicious behavior is evident here. The actual security risk depends on the contents of 'info'.",
  "conclusion": "This single import statement is not malicious by itself but could be used to hide malicious code if the imported module is malicious. There are no evident signs of malicious behavior or security risks from this snippet alone.",
