  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local module 'info' using a relative import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no runtime data or external inputs involved.",
  "sinks": "None in this line; no data or untrusted input is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the import loads symbols from 'info' into the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of all symbols from 'info'. No malicious behavior, code injection, or network activity is evident. The primary concern with such an import is namespace pollution and potential concealment of malicious code if 'info' is malicious, but this cannot be determined from this line alone. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk, high confidence) are appropriate given the limited context. The use of 'import *' is discouraged for clarity but does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk remains negligible, assuming the 'info' module is trustworthy.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign on its own. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the 'info' module. Without inspecting 'info', the risk remains low. The reports' scores are consistent with this assessment, and no modifications are necessary.",
