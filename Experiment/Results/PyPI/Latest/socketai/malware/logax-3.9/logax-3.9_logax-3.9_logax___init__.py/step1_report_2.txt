  "purpose": "Import all symbols and functions from the 'info' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module 'info' within the package.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data flows are evident in this line; it only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks is visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a wildcard import which can obscure what is being imported; however, this alone is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement importing all contents from a local module named 'info'. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues in this single line. Since it does not perform any data processing or network operations, no security risks or malware behavior can be inferred from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a standard practice to import local modules; however, wildcard imports can be discouraged for clarity but are not inherently malicious.",
