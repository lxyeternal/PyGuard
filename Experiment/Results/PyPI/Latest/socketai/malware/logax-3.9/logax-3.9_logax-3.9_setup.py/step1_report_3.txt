  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'logax' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package details.",
  "sources": "Reading external README.md file; no other data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data affects system security or leaks are identified.",
  "flows": "N/A — no untrusted data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code follows standard setup.py practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads a README file for a long description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are typical for Python package configuration. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a standard package configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
