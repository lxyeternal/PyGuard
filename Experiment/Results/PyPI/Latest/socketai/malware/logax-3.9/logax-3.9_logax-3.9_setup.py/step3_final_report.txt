  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and reading a README file for description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, static package metadata, dependencies ('requests', 'pybase64')",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external data processing",
  "flows": "Reading local file and passing static data to setup(), no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' script using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, user input, or external data handling. Dependencies are common, benign packages. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The code reads a local README.md file for description and specifies package metadata and dependencies. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, typical setup script. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are found. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code. The code does not perform any malicious actions or security vulnerabilities. The absence of hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code further supports this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python library, with no malicious or security concerns. All reports accurately reflect this assessment. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
