{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup with a custom installation step that exfiltrates system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads hostname, current working directory, and username from the environment during installation.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function sends collected data to a remote IP address, potentially leaking sensitive information.",
  "flows": "During the custom install run, system data (hostname, cwd, username) is collected and sent via HTTP GET request to the specified IP address.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration without any user consent or notification, which is suspicious. The IP address used is internal and could be malicious. No validation or encryption is used for the data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom install command that, upon execution, gathers system information and sends it to an external server. This behavior resembles data exfiltration and could be malicious if used without disclosure. The IP address is hardcoded and suspicious. The rest of the code is standard setup procedure with no other malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or indicators of sabotage are present outside this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be malicious or at least highly suspicious due to its covert data exfiltration behavior during package installation. It could be part of a supply chain attack where malicious packages gather system info and send it to an attacker-controlled server.",
