{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation command.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), requests.get()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to an external IP address with collected system data",
  "flows": "During installation, hostname, current directory, and username are collected and sent via HTTP GET request to a remote server",
  "anomalies": "Sending system information to a hardcoded IP address during package installation, no user consent or notification, potential data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and additional modules for network and system info collection. It defines a custom install class that overrides the run method. In this method, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP request to a specific IP address. The URL and data collection are suspicious because they could be used for tracking or data exfiltration without user awareness. The code appears to implement a supply chain attack by embedding malicious data collection within a package installation process. The IP address used (192.198.82.14) is suspicious and likely not associated with legitimate server infrastructure. No other malicious or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating user and system data to a remote server during package installation. It does not notify the user or obtain consent, indicating a likely supply chain attack or malicious package designed to harvest system information surreptitiously.",
