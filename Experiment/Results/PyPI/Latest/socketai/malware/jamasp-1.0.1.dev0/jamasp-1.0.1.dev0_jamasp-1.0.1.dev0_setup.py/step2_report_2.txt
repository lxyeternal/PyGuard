  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code and the context.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The setup script defines a custom install command (`CustomInstall`) that, during installation, collects system info: hostname, current working directory, and username.\n- It then sends this info via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded IP address (`192.198.82.14:3000/log`).\n- The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or backdoors beyond this data exfiltration.\n- The IP address is suspicious and not associated with legitimate infrastructure.\n- The behavior resembles covert data collection, which is typical in supply chain attacks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code **does** perform data exfiltration during package installation.\n- The data sent includes hostname, current directory, and username.\n- The transmission occurs via an unencrypted HTTP GET request to a hardcoded IP address.\n- No user notification or consent is provided.\n- No obfuscation or other malicious code is present outside this behavior.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports are consistent in identifying the exfiltration behavior.\n- The comments (e.g., \"# Dependency Confusion POC\") suggest awareness of supply chain attack techniques, which aligns with malicious intent.\n- The conclusion that this is malicious or highly suspicious is justified given the context.\n\n### Scores and Their Justification:\n- **Malware Score (~0.9):** Justified. The code performs covert data exfiltration, which is malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risk (~0.9):** Justified. The behavior poses a high security risk, especially during package installation without user awareness.\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Correct. The code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The high scores for malware and security risk are justified.\n- The reasoning that this could be part of a supply chain attack is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** **0.9** (highly suspicious, covert data exfiltration)  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk Score:** **0.9** (serious security concern)\n\n**Overall, the reports correctly identify the malicious nature of this code.**",
