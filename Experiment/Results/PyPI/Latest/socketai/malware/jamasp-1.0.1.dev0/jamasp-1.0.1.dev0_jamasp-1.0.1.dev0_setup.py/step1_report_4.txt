{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package with a custom installation step that sends system information to a specified remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during the custom installation process.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call transmits the collected system information to an external IP address over HTTP, potentially leaking sensitive system data.",
  "flows": "During package installation, system info is gathered via socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser(), then sent to 'http://192.198.82.14:3000/log' through an HTTP GET request.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a hardcoded IP address for exfiltration, which is suspicious. It also extends the standard setup process with a network request that appears unrelated to typical package installation tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common setup tools and system modules. It defines a custom installation class that overrides the run method. After executing the standard install process, it collects hostname, current directory, and username. Instead of typical post-installation steps, it sends this data to a hardcoded IP address via an HTTP GET request, which could be used for malicious data collection or command and control purposes. The use of a hardcoded IP for data exfiltration during package install indicates malicious intent or at least malicious capability, especially if intended without user awareness. The overall code structure suggests an attempt to embed data leakage into a seemingly innocent package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior: it exfiltrates system information during installation to an external IP address, which could be used for malicious tracking or data theft. The use of a hardcoded IP and network request during setup are significant red flags indicating malicious intent.",
