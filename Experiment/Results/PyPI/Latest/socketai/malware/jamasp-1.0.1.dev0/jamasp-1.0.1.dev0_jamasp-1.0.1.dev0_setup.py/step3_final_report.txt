{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded suspicious IP address.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to a remote IP address",
  "flows": "source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> requests.get() with these parameters",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration during installation without user notification; hardcoded IP address; straightforward code with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation by sending system info to a suspicious IP address. The data collection uses standard functions, and the network request is unencrypted and to a hardcoded IP, indicating malicious intent. The code is clear and un-obfuscated, with no other malicious behaviors. The activity aligns with supply chain attack techniques, and the exfiltration occurs silently, posing a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during installation, justifying high malware and security risk scores. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation. The activity is suspicious and potentially harmful, fitting a supply chain attack profile.",
