  "conclusion": "The code pattern involves executing external code from 'my.zip' during installation, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The behavior poses a significant security risk, especially if 'my.zip' is untrusted. The high malware and risk scores are justified, and this pattern should be flagged as a serious security concern."
