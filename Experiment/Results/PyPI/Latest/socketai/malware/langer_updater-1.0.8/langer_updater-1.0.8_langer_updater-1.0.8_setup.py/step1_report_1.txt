  "purpose": "This setup script customizes the installation process to load and execute code from a ZIP archive during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, loading and executing code from 'my.zip' via zipimport, calling 'hello()' method in the ZIP module.",
  "sinks": "Executing 'module.hello()' which could run arbitrary code from the ZIP archive.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> loading 'my.zip' via zipimport -> executing 'hello()' method in the ZIP module.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically loads and executes a module from a ZIP archive during installation, which is unusual and potentially suspicious. There are no hardcoded credentials or obvious malicious payloads but executing code from an external ZIP during setup is atypical.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file for long description, then defines a function 'test()' that loads a module from 'my.zip' using zipimport. It then executes 'hello()' from that module. The custom installation class 'LangInstall' overrides 'run()' to call 'test()' during installation. The setup uses this custom class. This behavior allows the execution of arbitrary code contained within 'my.zip' during installation, which could be malicious or maliciously crafted to run harmful code. The code itself does not contain malicious payloads directly but relies on external ZIP content, raising suspicion due to dynamic code execution at install time.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes external code from 'my.zip' during installation, which could be malicious depending on the ZIP content. This pattern is unusual and warrants caution, as it allows arbitrary code execution from an external archive at install time.",
