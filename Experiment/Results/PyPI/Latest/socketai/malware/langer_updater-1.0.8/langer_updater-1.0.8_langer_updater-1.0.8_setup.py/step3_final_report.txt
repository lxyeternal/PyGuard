{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically loads and executes code from 'my.zip' during package installation, executing 'hello()' from the module within the ZIP archive.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md'; loading 'my.zip' via zipimport.zipimporter; executing 'module.hello()' from the loaded module.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'module.hello()' which runs code from 'my.zip' during setup.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> loading 'my.zip' -> executing 'module.hello()' during install.",
  "anomalies": "Loading and executing code from an external ZIP archive during setup without validation or sandboxing.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a README file, then during installation, it loads 'my.zip' via zipimport, creates a module spec, executes the module, and calls 'hello()'. This pattern executes external code at install time, which is unusual and risky. The pattern could be exploited if 'my.zip' contains malicious code. The code itself is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The risk stems from executing untrusted external code during setup, which can lead to supply chain attacks or system compromise. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8, security risk ~0.8-0.9) are justified given the potential for malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern involves executing external code from 'my.zip' during installation, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The behavior poses a significant security risk, especially if 'my.zip' is untrusted. The high malware and risk scores are justified, and this pattern should be flagged as a serious security concern.",
