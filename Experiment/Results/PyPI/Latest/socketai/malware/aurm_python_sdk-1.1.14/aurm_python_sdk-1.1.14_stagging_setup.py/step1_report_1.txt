{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package called 'aurm-python-sdk' with custom installation behavior that fetches and executes external data during installation.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen() to fetch data from an external URL, reading files like ~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile, and the open() function to read 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "Writing fetched data into ~/.fleetwood.py, appending commands to shell configuration files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile).",
  "flows": "Fetches data from external URL -> writes to ~/.fleetwood.py -> appends command 'python ~/.fleetwood.py' to shell configs, which could execute this script upon shell startup.",
  "anomalies": "Automatically downloading and executing code from an external URL during package installation; modifies user's shell configuration files to run downloaded code, which can lead to persistent code execution without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads content from an external URL and writes it into a hidden Python script in the user's home directory. It then appends a command to run this script to the user's shell configuration files. This behavior enables remote code execution upon shell startup, which is a significant security concern. The download and execution are embedded within the installation process, making it potentially malicious or at least highly suspicious. The rest of the setup code appears standard, but the side effects pose serious security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs external data fetching and modifies user shell configs to execute remote code, indicating malicious behavior with persistent execution capabilities. It should be considered a security threat and is not safe to use.",
