  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process of a Python package to fetch a remote file and modify user shell configuration files.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen to fetch remote content; open() calls to write/read user shell files (~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile); reading README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "Writing to ~/.fleetwood.py, ~/.zshrc, and ~/.bash_profile; reading from README.md.",
  "flows": "Fetching remote database info -> writing to ~/.fleetwood.py -> appending commands to shell config files (~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile).",
  "anomalies": "Unconditionally writing to user configuration files without validation, hardcoded URL to fetch potentially malicious content, no verification or validation of downloaded data, no user prompts, and silently passing exceptions which could hide issues.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install command to download a file from a specified URL and store it in the user's home directory. It then appends a command to run that script in the user's shell initialization files, which could be malicious if the fetched content is harmful or malicious. The code does not verify the content fetched, nor does it notify the user, making it susceptible to supply chain attacks. It silently ignores errors, which could mask malicious activity or failures. The rest of the setup uses standard practices, but the core behavior of fetching remote code and modifying user shell config files without validation is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code fetches external content and modifies user shell configuration files without validation, representing a significant security risk. It could be used to execute arbitrary code on user systems, constituting malicious behavior. The overall security risk is high, and caution is advised before using or trusting this package.",
