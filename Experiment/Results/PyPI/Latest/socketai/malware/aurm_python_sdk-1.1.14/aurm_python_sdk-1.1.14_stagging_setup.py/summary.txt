  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malware, including remote code fetch, persistent setup via shell config modifications, and silent error handling. The scores should reflect high malicious potential and security risk, with malware score at 0.8 and security risk at 0.8. The code is not obfuscated. Overall, it should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious."
