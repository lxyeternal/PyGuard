  "purpose": "A simple static function returning a string, with no external inputs or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function returns a static string directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that returns a fixed string, with no inputs, external data, or complex logic. All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The analysis confirms that the code is safe and does not pose any security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications or further scrutiny are necessary.",
