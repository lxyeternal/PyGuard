  "purpose": "The code serves as a package initializer that imports 'test_function' from a sibling module and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .module1 importing test_function",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no external data leaks or network communication",
  "flows": "Import of test_function from module1, then exposure via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors; straightforward import and export",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file that imports a function from a sibling module and exposes it. It contains no data processing, no dynamic code execution, no environment variable access, and no network activity. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code aligns with standard package initialization practices, and the reports' conclusions are accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious or security concerns. The existing reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
