  "purpose": "Initialize the tests package by importing test_function from module1 for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing test_function from module1 within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "The import statement flows directly to the __all__ declaration, nothing indicating data flow to untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Standard package initialization; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function from a local module and declares it as part of the module's public interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious data handling. It is a typical __init__.py pattern for Python packages. No external data, user input, or network interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no malicious or security concern indications.",
