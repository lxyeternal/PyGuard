  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard package initialization code",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py file that imports a single function and declares it as part of the package's public API. It contains no data processing, input handling, or code execution beyond import statements. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
