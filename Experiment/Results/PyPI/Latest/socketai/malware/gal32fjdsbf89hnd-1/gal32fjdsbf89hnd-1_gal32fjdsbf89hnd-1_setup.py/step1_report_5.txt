{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package and attempts to run a custom command during installation, development, or egg info gathering.",
  "sources": "The custom_command() function, which executes a shell command to retrieve an access token via curl and Google metadata service, and posts it to an external webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing the curl command that transmits an access token to an external server, potentially leaking sensitive data.",
  "flows": "The setup process triggers the custom_command() during install, develop, or egg_info commands, leading to the retrieval and external transmission of an access token.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual inclusion of code that retrieves a Google Cloud metadata token and exfiltrates it via HTTP POST to an external webhook. The code runs this command in all three setup commands, which is suspicious. The setup uses random package names and minimal description, indicating possible obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and command classes from setuptools but introduces a custom command that executes a system shell command to fetch an access token from Google Cloud metadata service. This token is then sent to an external webhook URL. The custom command is invoked during install, develop, and egg_info stages, which are typical package setup phases. The retrieval and exfiltration of the token suggest an attempt to steal credentials or perform unauthorized actions. The overall structure is unusual for legitimate setup scripts and indicates malicious behavior. No other suspicious or malicious code is present; the primary concern is the exfiltration of sensitive credentials via the webhook.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior aimed at stealing Google Cloud access tokens during package installation or development. It exfiltrates sensitive credentials to an external server, constituting a security risk. The code is intentionally designed to execute this exfiltration at multiple setup phases, which is highly suspicious.",
