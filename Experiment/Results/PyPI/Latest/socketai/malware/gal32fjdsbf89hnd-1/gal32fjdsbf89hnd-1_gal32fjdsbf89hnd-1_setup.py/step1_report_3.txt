{
  "purpose": "This setup script appears to be used for installing a Python package, but it includes custom commands that execute a specific function during installation, development, and egg_info stages.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/output during the execution of custom commands defined in the run methods of the classes CustomInstallCommand, CustomDevelopCommand, and CustomEggInfoCommand. Specifically, the custom_command() function executes an OS system call that runs a shell command involving curl to fetch an access token from a Google Cloud metadata server and then POSTs that token to a webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "The sink is the os.system call executing the shell command, which involves fetching sensitive data (access token) and sending it via HTTP POST to an external URL (webhook.site).",
  "flows": "The flow is: During installation/development/egg_info, the custom_command() is invoked, which runs the shell command that retrieves a Google Cloud access token and then transmits this token to an external webhook, potentially leaking sensitive credentials.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a hardcoded command that fetches an access token from Google Cloud metadata server and immediately sends it to an external server via HTTP POST, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. The command is embedded directly in the Python code and executed without any validation or authorization checks. The setup script is not typically intended to perform such network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools modules to define custom install, develop, and egg_info commands, which extend standard behaviors. However, these custom commands invoke a function that runs a shell command fetching an access token from Google Cloud's internal metadata URL. The token is then sent to a specified webhook URL. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of potentially sensitive credentials during package setup, which is malicious or at least highly suspicious. The package information (name, description, author) appears generic and likely obfuscated or placeholder. The immediate network activity during installation is a security concern, indicating possible malicious intent or a backdoor.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior where, during package setup, it exfiltrates a Google Cloud access token to an external server. This indicates a clear security risk and possible malicious intent. The package should be considered dangerous to install or use.",
