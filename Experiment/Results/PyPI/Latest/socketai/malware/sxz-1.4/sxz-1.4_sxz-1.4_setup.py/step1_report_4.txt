  "purpose": "Configure and set up the Python package 'sxz' with metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools and find_packages, the setup() function call with package metadata.",
  "targets": "No explicit untrusted data sources or inputs; the code is static setup configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated logic, hardcoded secrets beyond standard package info, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a setup configuration for packaging. It specifies package name, version, author info, description, and classifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of external input. The use of find_packages() is standard for package discovery. All code is static and typical for a setup script, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears legitimate and safe for use.",
