{
  "purpose": "Define the package setup configuration for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string data for package metadata, such as name, version, author, and description.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks related to untrusted data or external outputs; no data leaks or malicious data flow are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identified; the code only assigns static metadata values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present. Usage of setuptools is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, then calls setup() with static parameters defining package metadata. There is no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All data is static and standard for Python package distribution. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and poses no security risks.",
