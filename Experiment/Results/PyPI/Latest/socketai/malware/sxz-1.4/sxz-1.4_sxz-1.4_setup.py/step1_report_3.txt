  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no use of untrusted input sources or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (metadata) flows into the setup() function; no external data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code appears to be a straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for packaging and calls setup() with static metadata including package name, version, author details, description, and classifiers. There are no dynamic or untrusted data sources, no code execution, no network activity, nor any suspicious logic. The code is simple and standard for Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python packaging configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears safe and benign.",
