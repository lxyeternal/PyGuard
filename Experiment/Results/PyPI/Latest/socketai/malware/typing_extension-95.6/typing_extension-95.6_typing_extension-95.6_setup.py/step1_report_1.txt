{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to configure and install a Python package named 'typing_extension', including custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version, author info), dependencies ('requests', 'psutil'), and executes a custom run method that imports and calls 'main' from 'main.py'.",
  "sinks": "The code's main sink is the call to 'main()' in the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class, which executes during installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method executes, which then imports 'main' and calls it, potentially executing arbitrary code from 'main.py'.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' runs 'main()' during installation without any validation, which is unusual. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The method 'main()' is imported dynamically and called, which could be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools for package setup. It defines a custom install command 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the 'run' method to execute 'main()' from 'main.py' during installation. This behavior is suspicious because executing arbitrary code during setup can be exploited for malicious purposes. However, the code itself appears to be a standard setup script with a custom install step. No suspicious code, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The main concern is the execution of 'main()' during install, which could be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful instructions. The code does not connect to external domains or handle sensitive data directly.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard but contains a potentially malicious behavior by executing 'main()' during installation without validation. This could allow malicious code execution if 'main.py' is compromised. Overall, the code itself is straightforward but warrants caution due to the custom install behavior.",
