  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom install command that executes a main() function after installation.",
  "sources": "The custom install command in the CrazyInstallStrat.run() method, which imports and executes main() from main.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() from main module during installation process, potential execution of arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method executes, importing main and calling main(), which could contain any code including malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class runs code at install time without clear validation or restrictions. The main() function is invoked post-installation, which is uncommon and could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python package named 'typing_extension' with version '95.6'. It defines a custom install command CrazyInstallStrat that, after performing standard installation steps, imports and executes main() from a local main module. This post-installation code execution could be benign but also potentially malicious, especially if the main() function contains harmful code or is controlled externally. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code's unusual behavior is the invocation of main() during install, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks if the main module is malicious or tampered with. Overall, the code itself is simple but its behavior introduces potential risk if main() is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The package executes arbitrary code via main() during installation, which can be exploited for malicious purposes. The code itself appears straightforward but has an unusual and potentially dangerous post-installation behavior that warrants caution.",
