  "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of 'main()' during installation poses a significant security risk, especially if 'main.py' is malicious or compromised. While the code itself is straightforward, this pattern is commonly exploited for malicious payloads. The overall malware and security risk scores should be elevated to approximately 0.75-0.8 to accurately reflect this threat. Caution is advised when installing such packages, and verification of 'main.py' is recommended before trust."
