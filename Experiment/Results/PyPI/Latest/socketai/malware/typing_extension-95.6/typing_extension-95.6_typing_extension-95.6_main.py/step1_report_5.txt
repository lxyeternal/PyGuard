  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory, and send this data encoded in base64 to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function, random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with query parameters containing collected data",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system info functions, encoded, then sent via HTTP GET requests to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of external URLs with suspicious domain names, encoding MAC addresses in base64 before transmission, multiple URLs for data exfiltration, no validation or sanitization of data before sending",
  "analysis": "The script collects host-specific data such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. The MAC addresses are retrieved based on OS, then encoded in base64, which obscures the raw MAC addresses but is still easily decoded. The data is sent to three external URLs via HTTP GET requests with parameters including hostname, username, current directory, and encoded MAC addresses. The URLs appear suspicious and potentially malicious, possibly used for tracking or exfiltration. There are no evident security controls, sanitization, or encryption beyond base64 encoding. No malicious code execution or system modification is observed, but the data collection and transmission pattern is characteristic of information gathering for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system data collection and exfiltration to external servers, which raises suspicion of malicious intent, such as data theft or tracking. The use of suspicious domains and the passive data transmission without user consent indicates potential malicious behavior.",
