  "conclusion": "The script exhibits behaviors typical of covert data exfiltration, with suspicious URLs and data encoding. While it does not contain active malicious payloads, its intent to silently gather and transmit system information to external servers indicates malicious or at least highly suspicious activity. The malware score should be high, and the security risk is significant, warranting caution and potential blocking."
