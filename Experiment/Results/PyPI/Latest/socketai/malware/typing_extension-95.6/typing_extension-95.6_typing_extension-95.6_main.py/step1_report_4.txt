{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs encoded in base64, possibly for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system info via platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), and get_mac_addresses().",
  "sinks": "Sends data via urllib.request.urlopen() to external URLs with encoded parameters.",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources is encoded (MAC addresses) and included as URL parameters, then transmitted over network requests to third-party domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external URLs (potential command-and-control or tracking domains). Encoding MAC addresses in base64, which can be used to obscure data. No explicit user consent or data handling transparency. The URL pattern and domains suggest possible malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system data including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. The MAC addresses are encoded in base64, which could be an attempt to obfuscate the data before transmission. It then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends the data via GET requests without validation or user consent. The URLs used are unusual and potentially malicious, indicating data exfiltration or tracking activity. No signs of obfuscation beyond base64 encoding, and the code does not perform any malicious actions directly on the system but does transmit potentially sensitive data to external sites, which is suspicious in context.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects and encodes system identifiers and transmits them to known suspicious domains without user consent, indicating malicious intent for data collection or exfiltration. Although it does not perform destructive actions, its purpose appears covert and potentially harmful.",
