      "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of 'main()' during installation poses a significant security risk, especially if 'main.py' is malicious or compromised. While the code itself is straightforward, this pattern is commonly exploited for malicious payloads. The overall malware and security risk scores should be elevated to approximately 0.75-0.8 to accurately reflect this threat. Caution is advised when installing such packages, and verification of 'main.py' is recommended before trust."

      "conclusion": "The script exhibits behaviors typical of covert data exfiltration, with suspicious URLs and data encoding. While it does not contain active malicious payloads, its intent to silently gather and transmit system information to external servers indicates malicious or at least highly suspicious activity. The malware score should be high, and the security risk is significant, warranting caution and potential blocking."
