  "purpose": "Configure the packaging and distribution of the 'leveup' Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Read package metadata from the setup() function, including package discovery via find_packages(), author details, and description.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or execute untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and discovery. It does not include any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling that could be malicious. All components are typical for Python package setup scripts and show no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign, standard package setup configuration with no malicious behavior detected.",
