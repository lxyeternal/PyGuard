  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields such as name, version, author, email, description, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no handling of untrusted data, user input, or external data sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools functions and calls setup() with hardcoded, static metadata. It contains no dynamic input, network activity, code execution, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these scores. No suspicious patterns, malicious behaviors, or vulnerabilities are present. The assessments are consistent and accurate, with no unwarranted assumptions or overlooked risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
