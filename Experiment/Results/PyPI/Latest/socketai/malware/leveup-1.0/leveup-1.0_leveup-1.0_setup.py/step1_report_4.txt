  "purpose": "Define and configure the package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static code; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external or untrusted sources; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup configuration without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package named 'leveup'. It uses 'setuptools' to specify package metadata such as name, version, author, email, description, and classifiers. There are no dynamic imports, user inputs, environment variables, or code execution mechanisms. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and conforms to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
