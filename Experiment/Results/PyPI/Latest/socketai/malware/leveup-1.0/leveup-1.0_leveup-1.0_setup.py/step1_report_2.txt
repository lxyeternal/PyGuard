{
  "purpose": "The code is used for configuring the packaging and distribution of a Python project named 'leveup'. It specifies package metadata and dependencies using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data such as package name, version, author, email, description, and classifiers; none of these sources involve untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations like network access, file manipulation, or execution.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the script only sets static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with static parameters defining package metadata. It uses find_packages() to automatically discover packages, which is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, network access, or other suspicious behaviors are present. The absence of any input handling or external data processing indicates a benign and typical setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package configuration without any anomalies or security concerns.",
