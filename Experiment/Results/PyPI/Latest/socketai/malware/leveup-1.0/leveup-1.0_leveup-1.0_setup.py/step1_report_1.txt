  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging a Python project named 'leveup'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines package metadata directly in the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform any data transmission.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code solely sets package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of 'setuptools' for packaging is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with static package metadata. There are no input operations, no network communications, or dynamic code execution. All data is hardcoded, and the structure is typical for Python package setup files. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It solely defines package metadata for distribution purposes.",
