  "purpose": "To configure and package a Python project named 'leveup' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Input data from the code itself, such as package metadata (name, version, author, email, description, classifiers).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data processing, network connections, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only defines package setup parameters without data flows or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs detected. The code uses standard setuptools setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for packaging, defines setup parameters including name, version, author, email, description, and classifiers. All elements appear standard and typical for Python package configuration. No embedded or dynamic code, no external data processing, no network operations, or obfuscated code. The code appears to serve a benign purpose of packaging the 'leveup' library. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It merely defines package metadata and configuration, with no suspicious or harmful code present.",
