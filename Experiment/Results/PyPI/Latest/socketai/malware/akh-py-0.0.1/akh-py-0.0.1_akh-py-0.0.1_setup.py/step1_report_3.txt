{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'akh-py' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "File reading operation for 'README.md' to obtain long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data sinks; setup parameters are static or controlled.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content into 'long_description' variable, then passing setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code, unusual constructs, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads a README file for long description, sets version and description variables, and calls setup() with package info and dependencies. All operations are standard for package setup. No suspicious code, no external data inputs beyond a static file read, and no code that would execute untrusted data. The dependencies are common packages ('requests' and 'discord'), and the script contains no network activity, code injection, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
