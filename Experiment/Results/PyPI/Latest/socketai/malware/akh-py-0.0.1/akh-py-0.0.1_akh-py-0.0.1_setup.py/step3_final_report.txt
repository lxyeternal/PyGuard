  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project, reading README.md for long description, and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description; static metadata variables; dependencies 'requests' and 'discord'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows; no network activity or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reading local README.md file; static data passed to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a local README.md file, defines static metadata, and specifies dependencies. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code is present. All five reviews correctly identify the benign nature of the script, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and the absence of suspicious elements justify these scores. No logical flaws or security concerns are evident, and the assessments are consistent and accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe Python package setup script with no security risks or malware indications. All reviews are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
