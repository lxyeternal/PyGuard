{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description, importing setup and find_packages, reading environment and file paths.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data sinks; setup parameters are static or controlled within the code.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Assigning metadata -> Passing parameters to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code. No external data inputs other than static files.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for package setup. Reads the README.md file content for long description, which is standard. Defines package metadata such as name, version, author, and dependencies. Uses find_packages() to include all packages automatically. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. No suspicious code, hidden behaviors, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious or security concerns identified. It performs typical package configuration tasks safely.",
