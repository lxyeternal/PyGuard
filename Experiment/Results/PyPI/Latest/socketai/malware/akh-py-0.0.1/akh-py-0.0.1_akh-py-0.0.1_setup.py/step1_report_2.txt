  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'akh-py' including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, codecs.open, os.path.join, os.path.abspath, codecs.open",
  "sinks": "setup() function with package info, install_requires list",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content -> setup configuration -> installation dependencies",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns detected. Use of standard setup tools and normal package info.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file for description, sets package metadata, and calls setuptools.setup() with package info and dependencies. No user input, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or suspicious code paths. Dependencies are standard ('requests', 'discord') and there are no embedded secrets or obfuscated code. The overall structure follows typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a project distribution setup.",
