  "purpose": "A standard Python package setup script defining package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields: name, version, author, description, packages list.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or external inputs.",
  "flows": "None; static data used solely for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Description field set to 'None' as a string, which is unusual but benign; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static, hardcoded metadata. No dynamic inputs, external data, or malicious code are present. The description being 'None' is unconventional but not harmful. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The code is a typical package configuration script, and all signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
