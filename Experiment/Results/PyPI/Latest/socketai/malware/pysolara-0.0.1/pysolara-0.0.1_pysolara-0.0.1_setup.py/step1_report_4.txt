  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'pysolara' Python library.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static setup parameters defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows or untrusted input handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard setuptools setup syntax without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with static package metadata. It lacks dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns. The setup parameters are typical for packaging a Python library. No external inputs, environmental variables, or dangerous behaviors are present. The structure and syntax are straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
