{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'pysolara' to be distributed via package managers.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; static setup parameters are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs are present; the code solely performs package configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A – there are no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The description field contains 'None' as a string, which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls the 'setup' function with static parameters to define package metadata. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no potential for data leaks or malicious actions. The parameters are standard for Python package setup. The description field containing 'None' may be considered odd, but it does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata without any suspicious or harmful code.",
