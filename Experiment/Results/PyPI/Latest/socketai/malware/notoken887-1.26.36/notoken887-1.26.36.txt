      "conclusion": "The setup script is benign in structure, with suspicious metadata that warrants caution but does not indicate malware or obfuscation within this code. External code invoked by the entry point could be malicious, but this cannot be determined here. The overall security risk is low to moderate, primarily due to metadata concerns."

      "conclusion": "Most reports are appropriately cautious, with low malware and risk scores where no suspicious activity is detected. Reports 3 and 4 indicate patterns that warrant slightly higher concern; thus, their malware scores should be increased to better reflect potential malicious behavior. Overall, the assessments are sound, but slight score adjustments enhance accuracy and risk representation."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, with embedded remote code download and execution triggered during decryption. The behavior is consistent with malware activity, and the obfuscation is moderate. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with the malware and risk scores at maximum levels. The obfuscation score should be uniformly high (~0.8) across all reports, reflecting the emoji cipher. Overall, this code should be flagged as malicious and removed or sandboxed immediately."

      "security_risk": 0.75,
      "obfuscated": 0.6,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation and dynamic execution techniques that pose significant security risks. While no explicit malicious payloads are evident, the pattern of decrypting and executing code at runtime can be exploited for malicious purposes. The overall security risk is high, and the malware potential is moderate, primarily due to the obfuscation and execution pattern. The code warrants cautious review, especially regarding the encrypted payloads and the external TokenCryptor implementation."
