  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign in structure, with suspicious metadata that warrants caution but does not indicate malware or obfuscation within this code. External code invoked by the entry point could be malicious, but this cannot be determined here. The overall security risk is low to moderate, primarily due to metadata concerns."
