  "purpose": "Analysis of potential malicious patterns, obfuscation, and security risks in the provided Python code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, suspicious import statements, obfuscated variable names, network activity, environment variable usage.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, eval or exec calls, file modifications, environment variable reads.",
  "flows": "Sources such as hardcoded secrets or dynamic code paths leading to sinks like network transmission, file access, or code execution functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, suspicious import patterns, high obfuscation scores, inconsistent malware scoring with suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided reports vary in detail. Reports 1, 2, and 5 show no code or suspicious patterns, with scores appropriately low. Reports 3 and 4 identify suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, and dynamic code execution, but assign relatively low malware scores (0.2). Given the severity of such patterns, these scores should be slightly increased to reflect potential malicious intent. Specifically, Report 3's malware score should be raised from 0.2 to approximately 0.5, considering the presence of hardcoded secrets and dynamic execution. Similarly, Report 4's malware score can be adjusted from 0.2 to 0.3 due to high obfuscation and suspicious structure. Obfuscation scores in Reports 3 and 4 are justified, but overall, a moderate obfuscation score (~0.5) better captures the suspicion level. Risk scores should also be adjusted accordingly, with a moderate overall risk (~0.3-0.5). The scores in the original reports are generally consistent with their descriptions, but minor adjustments improve alignment with the severity of suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are appropriately cautious, with low malware and risk scores where no suspicious activity is detected. Reports 3 and 4 indicate patterns that warrant slightly higher concern; thus, their malware scores should be increased to better reflect potential malicious behavior. Overall, the assessments are sound, but slight score adjustments enhance accuracy and risk representation.",
