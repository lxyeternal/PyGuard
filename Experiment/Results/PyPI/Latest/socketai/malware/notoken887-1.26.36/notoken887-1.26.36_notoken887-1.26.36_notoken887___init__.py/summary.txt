  "conclusion": "Most reports are appropriately cautious, with low malware and risk scores where no suspicious activity is detected. Reports 3 and 4 indicate patterns that warrant slightly higher concern; thus, their malware scores should be increased to better reflect potential malicious behavior. Overall, the assessments are sound, but slight score adjustments enhance accuracy and risk representation."
