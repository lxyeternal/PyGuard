{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended to perform data processing and possibly communicate with an external server.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, environment variables, or external files.",
  "sinks": "Network calls to external domains, database queries, or file writes.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from sources through processing functions and then to sinks such as network or database operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, or unusual network activity. Hardcoded URLs or credentials, if present, are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains several functions that process input data and make network requests. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are detected. Usage of standard libraries and no obfuscated code features are evident. No suspicious dynamic code execution, such as eval() with untrusted data. The network requests are to legitimate-looking domains, and no data exfiltration patterns are obvious. No malware-like behavior, such as data theft, system manipulation, or hidden backdoors, is detected based on the provided code snippet. The structure appears straightforward and typical for data processing applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no clear signs of malicious intent or malware. It performs expected data handling and network communication without suspicious or malicious patterns.",
