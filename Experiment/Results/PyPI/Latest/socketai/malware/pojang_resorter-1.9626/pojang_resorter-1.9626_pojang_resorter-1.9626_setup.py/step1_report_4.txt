{
  "purpose": "This setup script installs a Python package named 'pojang_resorter' and attempts to run an executable file during and after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to check for the existence of 'your_executable.exe' within the package directory during installation and when the entry point is invoked.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run() calls execute the 'your_executable.exe' file, which is a potential sink where malicious behavior could occur if the executable is malicious.",
  "flows": "The script checks for the existence of 'your_executable.exe' in the package directory, then executes it during installation and when the console script is invoked.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically runs an executable file ('your_executable.exe') during setup and upon invoking the console command without validation or user consent. No checksums or signatures are verified. The executable path is constructed dynamically but is used directly, which could be suspicious if the executable is malicious or tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after standard installation, looks for an executable 'your_executable.exe' in the package's installation directory. If found, it executes this file using subprocess.run(). Additionally, a function run_executable() also attempts to locate and run the same executable when the console script 'pojang-resorter' is invoked. There are no validation steps, such as signature verification, nor any user prompts or safeguards. The script unconditionally runs an external executable during setup and at runtime, which is a common behavior in supply chain attacks or malicious packages aiming to execute unauthorized code on the target system. The executable path is printed for debugging, which could be used to confirm its location during installation. Overall, this behavior indicates a high risk of malicious activity or sabotage, especially if the executable is malicious or replaced.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code unconditionally runs an external executable during installation and execution without validation, indicating malicious or suspicious behavior. This is a security risk as it can execute arbitrary or malicious code without user consent, representing a supply chain attack vector.",
