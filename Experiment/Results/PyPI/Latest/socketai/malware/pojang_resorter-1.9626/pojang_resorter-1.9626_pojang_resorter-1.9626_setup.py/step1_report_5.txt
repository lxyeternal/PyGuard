  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes custom installation steps to run an external executable after installation.",
  "sources": "os.path.join(self.install_lib, 'pojang_resorter', 'your_executable.exe') and os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'pojang_resorter', 'your_executable.exe')",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run([exe_path], check=True)",
  "flows": "The setup process installs the package, then executes an external executable located within the package directory during installation and when the console script is invoked.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically executes an external executable ('your_executable.exe') during both installation and runtime without any validation, obfuscation, or user confirmation. It does not check the content or source of the executable, nor does it limit execution permissions.",
  "analysis": "The script leverages setuptools to install a package and uses a custom install command that runs an external executable from within the package directory post-installation. It also defines a console script entry point that triggers the same executable when invoked. The executable path is constructed dynamically and executed via subprocess.run without any verification or security checks. This behavior could be exploited if the executable is malicious or tampered with, as it runs automatically without user consent or validation. No code obfuscation or encrypted behavior is evident; the code structure is straightforward. The lack of validation or user prompts indicates potential malicious intent or a serious security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary concern is the automatic execution of an external executable during package installation and invocation, which could be malicious if the executable is compromised or maliciously inserted. This behavior poses a significant security risk as it runs arbitrary code without validation, potentially leading to system compromise.",
