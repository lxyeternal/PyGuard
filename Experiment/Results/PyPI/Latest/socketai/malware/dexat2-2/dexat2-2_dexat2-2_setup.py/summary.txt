  "conclusion": "The package is benign, with a minor coding mistake and potentially misleading description language. No malicious activity or malware is present. The main issue is the incorrect 'version' type, which should be fixed to prevent setup errors. The suspicious wording in descriptions does not translate into actual malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores should reflect minimal risk."
