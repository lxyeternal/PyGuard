  "purpose": "Simple demonstration function to print 'hello world'",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output via print() function",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static print statement with no external data",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in the main guard statement (should be '==' instead of '=')",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function 'hello' that prints a greeting. The main guard is intended to execute 'hello()' when the script runs directly, but contains a syntax error: 'if __name__ = \"__main__\"' should be 'if __name__ == \"__main__\"'. This error prevents the script from running as intended. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no obfuscated elements or external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign script with a syntax error preventing execution. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious code or data flows. The error is minor and unrelated to security risks.",
