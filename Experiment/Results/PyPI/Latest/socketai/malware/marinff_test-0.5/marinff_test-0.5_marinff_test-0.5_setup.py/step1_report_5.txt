{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package that, upon installation, establishes a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded IP address (LHOST), port number (LPORT), and the reverse shell command string. The command is constructed dynamically within the run method of a custom install class.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a base64-decoded shell command that creates a reverse shell, connecting to an external IP.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code generates a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes it in a shell, and executes it, establishing a network connection back to the attacker-controlled server.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a hardcoded IP and port, constructs a reverse shell command dynamically, encodes it in base64, and executes it via os.system during package installation. The reverse shell payload is obfuscated through base64 encoding, which is suspicious. The intent appears malicious as it automates establishing remote access during installation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, when run, constructs a reverse shell command targeting a specific IP and port. The command is stored as a string, then encoded with base64 to obfuscate its content. It then decodes and executes the command using os.system, which sets up a reverse shell to the attacker. The use of hardcoded IP and port, combined with the automated execution of a reverse shell during package installation, indicates malicious intent. The obfuscation via base64 adds to suspicion, as it aims to hide the malicious payload. There are no other external inputs or user data; the entire payload is hardcoded and automated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to establish a reverse shell connection automatically during package installation, indicating malicious intent. It employs obfuscation techniques and hardcoded network details to conceal its purpose. This code constitutes a supply chain security risk and should be considered malicious.",
