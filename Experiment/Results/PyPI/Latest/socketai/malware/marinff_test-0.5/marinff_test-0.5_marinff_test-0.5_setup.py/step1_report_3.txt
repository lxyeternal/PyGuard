{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python setup script that installs a module and executes a reverse shell command upon installation.",
  "sources": "The reverse shell command constructed and executed within the CustomInstall class during the run method.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call that executes the decoded base64 payload which initiates a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP and port.",
  "flows": "The script constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP address and port, base64 encoding of reverse shell command, execution of system commands during install, use of socket and os modules in malicious context.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define a package installation process. The CustomInstall class overrides the run method to execute a reverse shell payload. The payload is a Python command that connects back to a specified IP and port, providing remote shell access. The payload string is encoded in base64 to obfuscate its contents, then decoded and executed via os.system. The inclusion of hardcoded network parameters and execution of reverse shell code during installation indicates malicious intent or backdoor behavior. The overall structure is straightforward but contains malicious logic embedded in the install process.",
  "conclusion": "The script is malicious, implementing a hidden reverse shell backdoor during package installation. It hardcodes network parameters, encodes commands in base64 for obfuscation, and executes potentially harmful system commands. The package should be considered highly dangerous.",
