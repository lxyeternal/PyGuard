{
  "purpose": "This setup script is designed to install a Python module and execute a reverse shell upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; the primary data source is hardcoded within the script, specifically the IP and port for the reverse shell.",
  "sinks": "The code executes a system command that decodes and runs a base64-encoded reverse shell command, which connects to a remote server.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded reverse shell command is base64-encoded, decoded, and executed via os.system, establishing a network connection to a specified IP and port for remote access.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a hardcoded IP address and port, and executes a reverse shell payload automatically during installation. There is a typo in 'socket' (written as 'secket'), which would cause runtime error, but the intention appears malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the setup process to include a custom installation class that, upon running, constructs a reverse shell command. The command is encoded in base64 to obfuscate its intent, then decoded and executed, establishing remote access. The use of hardcoded IP/port and automatic execution during install are suspicious. Despite a typo ('secket'), the intention seems malicious. No user input or external data is involved; the malicious behavior is embedded directly into the setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The code attempts to execute a reverse shell during package installation, indicating malicious intent. The hardcoded connection details and automatic execution point to a backdoor or remote access tool embedded within the package. Overall, this package is highly suspicious and dangerous to use.",
