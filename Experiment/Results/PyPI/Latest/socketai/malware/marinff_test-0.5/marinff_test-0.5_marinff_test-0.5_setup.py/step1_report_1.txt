  "purpose": "Custom setup script intended to install a Python module and establish a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port upon installation.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded IP address ('192.168.239.158'), port number (1234), and the reverse shell command within the CustomInstall class's run method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'os.system' which executes a decoded base64-encoded reverse shell command, potentially allowing remote control of the system.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system, creating a direct source-to-sink flow from code execution to remote access.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded IP and port for reverse shell; embedding of a reverse shell command that is base64-encoded and executed automatically during package installation; use of 'os.system' for executing shell commands without sanitization; typo 'secket' instead of 'socket' in socket creation line, which would cause a runtime error.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon execution, attempts to run a reverse shell connecting back to a specified IP and port. It constructs a reverse shell command within Python, encodes it in base64, and executes it via 'os.system'. The command, if correctly formatted, would open a shell session accessible remotely. However, due to a typo in 'socket' (misspelled as 'secket'), the code would fail at runtime, preventing the reverse shell from executing. Nonetheless, the intent clearly aligns with malicious behavior, aiming for remote access during package installation. The hardcoded IP and port, along with automatic execution of shell commands, indicate malicious intent or at least highly suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to establish a reverse shell connection during installation, representing malicious behavior. The typo prevents execution in its current form, but the intent is evident. This code poses a security risk if executed, as it could allow unauthorized remote access. It should be considered malicious and avoided.",
