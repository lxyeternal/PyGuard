{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with a custom installation script that attempts to establish a reverse shell connection upon installation.",
  "sources": "The reverse shell command constructed and executed in the run method of CustomInstall class.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing a decoded base64-encoded string that runs a reverse shell payload.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes it at runtime, and executes it via os.system, leading to remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual inclusion of reverse shell code within setup.py; use of base64 encoding to obfuscate payload; hardcoded IP address and port; executing shell commands during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities and defines a CustomInstall class overriding the run method. During installation, it constructs a reverse shell command that connects back to a specified IP and port, encodes this command in base64, and then decodes and executes it via os.system. The payload establishes a socket connection and spawns a bash shell, providing remote control. Hardcoded IP and port suggest malicious intent. The use of base64 encoding may be an attempt to evade detection. The execution of a reverse shell during package installation is a significant security concern, indicating malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious payload: a reverse shell executed during package installation. It is designed to allow remote control over the host system, representing malicious behavior and security risk. This package should be considered dangerous and should not be used.",
