  "purpose": "Collect system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data to multiple external URLs with randomized query parameters.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which executes system commands to gather MAC addresses, and random.randint() for generating a number.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send HTTP requests containing system info to external servers.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are encoded and included in URL parameters, which are then sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of multiple suspicious external domains (oast-cn, oast.fun) known for security testing or malicious activities. Data collection includes hardware info and system identifiers. The URLs and data exfiltration pattern resemble malicious command-and-control communication. The code encodes MAC addresses in base64 before transmission, potentially to obscure data.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers sensitive system information, including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current working directory. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64. It then constructs URLs targeting known suspicious or testing domains, appending the collected data as query parameters, and sends HTTP GET requests to these URLs. The data transmission appears designed for stealthy information exfiltration. The use of multiple external domains, particularly those associated with security testing or malicious operations, combined with data collection and network communication, indicates malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior. No user input is involved, but the data exfiltration pattern and external contact points are typical of malware or spyware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its data collection and transmission to suspicious domains, indicating potential malware behavior designed for system info exfiltration. It does not perform any overt malicious actions like executing payloads but exhibits characteristics of malware via clandestine data exfiltration.",
