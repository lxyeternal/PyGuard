  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs as encoded parameters.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which reads system-specific network interface info.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() which makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs with collected data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Source functions gather data → data is base64-encoded and URL-encoded → URLs are constructed with these parameters → data is transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs with suspicious domains, encoding system data before transmission, and no indication of user consent or encryption of sensitive data beyond base64. No user prompts or opt-out mechanisms. Exception handling suppresses errors silently.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are retrieved differently based on OS, and then encoded using base64. The script constructs HTTP GET requests to three external URLs with these data points as URL parameters, and sends requests without verifying server responses or handling errors explicitly. The URLs appear suspicious and potentially malicious, likely used for tracking or exfiltration. The data collection method is straightforward but combined with external communication to unknown servers indicates potential privacy violations or malicious intent. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present; however, the behavior aligns with covert data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system data collection and transmits it to external suspicious domains, likely for tracking or malicious data exfiltration. While technically simple, the intent to silently gather and send system info raises security concerns. No overt malware behaviors like code execution or backdoors are evident, but the data transmission to suspicious URLs constitutes malicious activity.",
