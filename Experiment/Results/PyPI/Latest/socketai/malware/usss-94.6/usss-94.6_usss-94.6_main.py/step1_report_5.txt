  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system commands, random.randint() generating a number, and data encoding with base64.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending HTTP GET requests with system info parameters to external URLs.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, encoded MAC addresses) from sources through URL construction to external servers via GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain names; encoding MAC addresses in base64 before transmission; collecting MAC addresses via system commands which may be inconsistent or unreliable. No explicit hardcoded credentials but potential for data exfiltration. No data received from the server is processed or validated.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system data such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current working directory. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends requests to three external domains, which appear suspicious due to their unusual domain names and structure. The use of multiple external endpoints for data exfiltration suggests malicious intent, especially since the data includes hardware identifiers. The code does not perform any validation or handling of responses, indicating the primary purpose may be covert data collection. No hardcoded credentials or malware payloads are evident, but the pattern of information gathering and transmission to suspicious domains is characteristic of data theft or backdoor behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect and exfiltrate system identifiers to external, suspicious URLs without user consent. It demonstrates potential malicious behavior focused on privacy invasion and data theft. The lack of any response handling or encryption raises security concerns. Overall, the code has a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
