  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple remote URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which reads MAC addresses from system commands, and the base64 encoded MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() which transmits data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "System information (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) is gathered and encoded, then sent via GET requests to multiple remote endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs are obscure and suspicious, possibly used for data exfiltration. The use of random numbers in URL parameters and base64 encoding of MAC addresses suggests an attempt to obfuscate data collection. No explicit user input or untrusted sources are directly used, but the data transmission to unknown external servers is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script collects environment details such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data to multiple external URLs via GET requests. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely malicious or used for covert data exfiltration. No malicious system modifications, backdoors, or harmful payloads are evident. The code’s behavior aligns with potential data harvesting and stealthy communication with command-and-control servers.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for covertly gathering system information and transmitting it to external servers, which could be used for malicious surveillance or data theft. Despite no immediate damage or system compromise, its behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
