  "conclusion": "The script is primarily designed for covert data exfiltration, collecting environment identifiers and transmitting them to suspicious external domains. While it lacks direct malicious payloads or code execution, its behavior is characteristic of malware or spyware used for privacy invasion and data theft. The scores should reflect high suspicion of malicious intent, with malware likelihood around 0.8 and overall security risk also high (~0.8)."
