  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation step that executes code from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The import of 'main' and invocation of 'main()' within the custom 'run' method of CrazyInstallStrat.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' after installation; potential for malicious code if 'main()' is malicious.",
  "flows": "During package installation, 'main()' from 'main' module is called, executing any code within 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes arbitrary code ('main()') post-installation without any validation or restrictions.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. A custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' overrides the 'run' method, which calls the standard install process and then imports and executes 'main()' from 'main.py'. This behavior is unusual because it runs arbitrary code immediately after installation, which could be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful logic. The rest of the code appears standard for package setup. The pattern of executing code after install without validation is suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes or unintended side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious behavior where it automatically executes 'main()' from 'main.py' post-installation. This can be exploited for malicious activities if 'main()' is malicious. The setup is otherwise typical, but the post-install execution is a security concern.",
