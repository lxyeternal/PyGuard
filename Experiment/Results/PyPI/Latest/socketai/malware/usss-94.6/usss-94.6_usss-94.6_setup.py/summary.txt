  "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is a significant security concern, as it can be exploited for malicious purposes. While the actual maliciousness depends on the content of 'main.py', the pattern itself warrants caution. The overall malware and risk scores should be high, around 0.75 to 0.8, reflecting the potential for malicious activity. This pattern should be flagged and reviewed thoroughly before distribution or use."
