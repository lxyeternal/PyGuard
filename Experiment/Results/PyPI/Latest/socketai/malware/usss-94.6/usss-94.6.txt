      "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is a significant security concern, as it can be exploited for malicious purposes. While the actual maliciousness depends on the content of 'main.py', the pattern itself warrants caution. The overall malware and risk scores should be high, around 0.75 to 0.8, reflecting the potential for malicious activity. This pattern should be flagged and reviewed thoroughly before distribution or use."

      "conclusion": "The script is primarily designed for covert data exfiltration, collecting environment identifiers and transmitting them to suspicious external domains. While it lacks direct malicious payloads or code execution, its behavior is characteristic of malware or spyware used for privacy invasion and data theft. The scores should reflect high suspicion of malicious intent, with malware likelihood around 0.8 and overall security risk also high (~0.8)."
