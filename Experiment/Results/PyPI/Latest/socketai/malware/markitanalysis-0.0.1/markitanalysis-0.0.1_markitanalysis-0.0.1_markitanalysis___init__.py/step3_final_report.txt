  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication present",
  "flows": "Import of 'welcome' from local module; exposure via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious or unusual code constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python module that imports a symbol and exposes it. No dynamic execution, data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assign zero malware and risk scores, and high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions support the conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's straightforward structure.",
