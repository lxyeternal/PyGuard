  "anomalies": "No anomalies, code is minimal and straightforward; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'welcome' from a relative module 'markitanalysis' and defines '__all__' for export control. No data input, external data sources, or user input handling is present. No dangerous functions or data flows are visible. The code appears to be part of a package's API definition, with no malicious behavior or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export pattern with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It simply exposes a 'welcome' component from another module.",
