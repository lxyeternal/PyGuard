{
  "purpose": "The code exports the 'welcome' function or variable from the 'markitanalysis' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local 'markitanalysis' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks, as the code only performs an import and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure; no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single item 'welcome' from a local module and specifies it for public API exposure via __all__. It does not include any dynamic execution, data handling, or network activity. The code is straightforward and typical for module exports, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module export pattern with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
