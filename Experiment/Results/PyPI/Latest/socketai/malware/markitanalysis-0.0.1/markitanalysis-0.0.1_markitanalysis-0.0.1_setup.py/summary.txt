  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high-risk behavior involving data exfiltration during package installation, with insecure network practices and external communication to a suspicious endpoint. The behavior justifies a malware score of approximately 0.8 and a security risk score around 0.85. No obfuscation is present. The scores in the reports are appropriate; the code should be flagged for review and caution before use."
