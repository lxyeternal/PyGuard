{
  "purpose": "The code performs post-installation data collection, including hostname, external IP, and environment variables, and transmits this information to an external URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname via os.popen, environment variables GITHUB_TOKEN and GITHUB_REPOSITORY, and fetching external IP from https://api.ipify.org",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data via requests.post to an external URL with verify=False, which transmits data over an insecure connection",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, IP, environment variables) is gathered and then sent directly to the external URL in a POST request, bypassing SSL verification",
  "anomalies": "Network request during package installation, use of verify=False, default fallback for GITHUB_TOKEN, printing sensitive info, and external URL (ngrok endpoint)",
  "analysis": "The code executes network requests during installation, collecting sensitive system info and environment variables, and transmits this data to an external server with SSL verification disabled. It logs sensitive info and uses insecure defaults. These behaviors are indicative of potential data exfiltration or malicious activity. The external URL is suspicious, and the insecure SSL handling poses security risks. The code is straightforward but exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious or highly suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high-risk behavior involving data exfiltration during package installation, with insecure network practices and external communication to a suspicious endpoint. The behavior justifies a malware score of approximately 0.8 and a security risk score around 0.85. No obfuscation is present. The scores in the reports are appropriate; the code should be flagged for review and caution before use.",
