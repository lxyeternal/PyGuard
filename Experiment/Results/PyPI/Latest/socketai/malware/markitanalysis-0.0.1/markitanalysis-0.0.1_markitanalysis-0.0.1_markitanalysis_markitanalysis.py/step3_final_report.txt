  "anomalies": "Use of verify=False to disable SSL verification and suppression of SSL warnings",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward HTTP GET request to an external API to retrieve the public IP address and prints it. The main security concern is the use of verify=False, which disables SSL certificate verification, exposing the request to potential man-in-the-middle attacks. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The response data is only printed, with no further data flow or exfiltration. The code is simple and benign, with the only issue being insecure SSL handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs a simple utility function. The primary security concern is the insecure SSL verification, which could be exploited in untrusted networks but does not indicate malicious intent or malware. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.2-0.3) reflecting the SSL issue.",
