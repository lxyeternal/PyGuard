  "purpose": "Fetch and display the system's public IP address using an external API.",

  "sinks": "Printing the response text to standard output",
  "flows": "requests.get fetches data from the external API, then the response text is printed",
  "anomalies": "Suppresses SSL verification warnings and disables SSL verification in requests, which can be insecure; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code makes an outbound HTTPS request to a known API (ipify) to retrieve the public IP address. It disables SSL verification via verify=False, which can expose the request to man-in-the-middle attacks but is not inherently malicious. It does not include any obfuscated code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is straightforward, with proper exception handling for request errors. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple utility to obtain and display the public IP address. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain threats. The main security concern is the disabling of SSL verification, which reduces security but does not constitute malicious activity.",
