  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs a simple utility function. The primary security concern is the insecure SSL verification, which could be exploited in untrusted networks but does not indicate malicious intent or malware. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.2-0.3) reflecting the SSL issue."
