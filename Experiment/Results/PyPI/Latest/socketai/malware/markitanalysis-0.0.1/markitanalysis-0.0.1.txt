      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high-risk behavior involving data exfiltration during package installation, with insecure network practices and external communication to a suspicious endpoint. The behavior justifies a malware score of approximately 0.8 and a security risk score around 0.85. No obfuscation is present. The scores in the reports are appropriate; the code should be flagged for review and caution before use."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs a simple utility function. The primary security concern is the insecure SSL verification, which could be exploited in untrusted networks but does not indicate malicious intent or malware. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.2-0.3) reflecting the SSL issue."
