  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'fairsequence', which customizes the installation process to run a main() function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools and the custom install class; invocation of main() in the run() method of CrazyInstallStrat.",
  "sinks": "Calling main() from main.py after installation, which could potentially execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Installation process triggers CrazyInstallStrat.run(), which calls install.run() and then executes main() from main.py.",
  "anomalies": "Custom install class that executes main() post-installation is unusual and can be exploited if main() contains malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary setup tools and defines a custom install command 'CrazyInstallStrat' that runs the normal installation process and then executes main() from main.py. This behavior is non-standard, as post-install scripts that run arbitrary code can be used maliciously. The setup() function assigns this custom command to replace the default install process, making it a potential vector for executing malicious code if main() is malicious. There are no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code; the main concern is the execution of external code during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The script's primary concern is the execution of main() after installation, which is a common tactic for malicious post-install scripts. While the code itself is straightforward, this pattern is suspicious because it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation. If main() contains malicious code, it could harm the user's system or perform malicious actions.",
