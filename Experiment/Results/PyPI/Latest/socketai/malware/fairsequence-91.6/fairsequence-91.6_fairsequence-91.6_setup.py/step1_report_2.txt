  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration and extend installation process to run a custom function from main.py during installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, particularly 'from main import main' inside the run method of CrazyInstallStrat.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function from main.py during installation process.",
  "flows": "During package installation, 'main()' from main.py is imported and executed.",
  "anomalies": "The run method executes 'main()' unconditionally during install, which is unusual and could be malicious if 'main()' performs harmful actions. The code dynamically imports and executes code from 'main', which may be used to run arbitrary code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, after performing standard installation, imports and runs a function 'main' from a module 'main'. This behavior occurs automatically during installation, which is uncommon and can be exploited to execute malicious code. No other suspicious or malicious patterns, such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code, are evident. The code structure itself is straightforward, but the execution of external code at install time is potentially dangerous, especially if 'main' contains malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes 'main()' from main.py during installation, which could be exploited to run malicious code or backdoors. This behavior warrants caution as it allows arbitrary code execution at install time. No other malicious indicators or obfuscation are present.",
