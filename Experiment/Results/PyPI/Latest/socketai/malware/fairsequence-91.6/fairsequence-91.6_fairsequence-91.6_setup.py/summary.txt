  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and poses a supply chain security risk. While no malicious code is confirmed, the behavior warrants caution. The scores should reflect a moderate to high risk, with a malware score around 0.4 and a security risk of 0.6, due to the potential for arbitrary code execution."
