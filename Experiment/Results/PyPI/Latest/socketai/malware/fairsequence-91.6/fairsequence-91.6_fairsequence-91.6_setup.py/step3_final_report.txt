{
  "purpose": "The code executes a custom installation step that imports and runs 'main()' from 'main.py' during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "The import 'from main import main' inside the 'run()' method, executed during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during setup, which could run arbitrary code from 'main.py'.",
  "flows": "After standard installation, the code imports 'main' and executes 'main()', creating a source-to-sink flow that runs external code during install.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of 'main()' during setup, which is non-standard and suspicious; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that, after completing the normal installation process, imports and executes 'main()' from 'main.py'. This pattern is unusual and can be exploited if 'main.py' contains malicious code. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The execution of external code during installation poses a significant supply chain security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.3-0.4, security risk around 0.5-0.6) are reasonable, reflecting moderate to high concern depending on the content of 'main.py'. Given the potential for malicious activity, a conservative malware score of 0.4 and a security risk score of 0.6 are appropriate, emphasizing the need for further review of 'main.py'.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and poses a supply chain security risk. While no malicious code is confirmed, the behavior warrants caution. The scores should reflect a moderate to high risk, with a malware score around 0.4 and a security risk of 0.6, due to the potential for arbitrary code execution.",
