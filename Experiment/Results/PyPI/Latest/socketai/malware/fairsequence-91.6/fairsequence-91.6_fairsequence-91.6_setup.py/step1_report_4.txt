{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and installation process for the 'fairsequence' Python project, including a custom installation step that executes a function from 'main.py'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'setuptools' modules, imports a custom class, and dynamically imports 'main' during installation.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' from 'main.py' during the install process is a potential sink, especially if 'main.py' contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "The installation process triggers 'CrazyInstallStrat.run()', which in turn imports and executes 'main()', creating a source-to-sink path.",
  "anomalies": "Executing 'main()' during installation is unusual and could be used to run malicious code automatically upon package installation. The class name 'CrazyInstallStrat' is non-standard and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard 'setuptools' modules for package setup. It defines a custom install class that overrides the 'run' method. In this method, it executes 'install.run(self)' to perform normal installation tasks, then dynamically imports 'main' and calls 'main()'. The presence of this dynamic call during installation is unusual and potentially malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The setup configuration appears normal except for the custom install class. No other suspicious behaviors or hardcoded secrets are evident in this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary concern is the automatic execution of 'main()' during package installation, which could be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The rest of the script appears standard, but the custom install behavior warrants caution.",
