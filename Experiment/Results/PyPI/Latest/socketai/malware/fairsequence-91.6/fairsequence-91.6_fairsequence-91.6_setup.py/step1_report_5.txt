  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration with a custom install command that executes a function from main module after installation.",
  "sources": "The import of main in the run method of CrazyInstallStrat class.",
  "sinks": "Calling main() after installation, which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method executes, importing and calling main().",
  "anomalies": "The run method calls main() from main module without any validation or restrictions; this may execute arbitrary code during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package 'fairsequence'. It includes a custom install class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the run method to execute main() from main module upon installation completion. The call to main() is unconditionally executed, which could run arbitrary code included in main.py, representing a supply chain risk. The setup dependencies are standard. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payload, or hardcoded secrets. However, executing main() during installation could be malicious if main.py contains harmful code. The overall behavior suggests a potential risk depending on main.py contents, but no explicit malicious activity is shown in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a function from main.py during package installation, which could be malicious if main.py contains harmful code. The setup itself is standard, but the unconditional execution during install is a security concern.",
