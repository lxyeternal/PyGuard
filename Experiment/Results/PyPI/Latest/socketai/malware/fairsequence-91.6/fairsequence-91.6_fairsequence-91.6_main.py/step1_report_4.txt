  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs with encoded MAC addresses.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network interfaces, hardcoded URLs.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending data to external servers.",
  "flows": "System info sources (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) are encoded and sent via HTTP GET requests to specified URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs with suspicious domains, encoding MAC addresses with base64 (possible obfuscation), no validation or authentication, silent exception handling, system-specific commands to extract MAC addresses which could be manipulated in some environments.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers host-specific information including MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this information via GET requests to external URLs. The URLs appear suspicious, potentially tracking or exfiltrating system data. No direct malicious actions like data theft or reverse shell are evident, but the pattern of data collection and transmission, especially to obscure or suspicious domains, raises concern for privacy invasion or malicious tracking. The code does not perform any malicious activity itself but could be part of a data exfiltration or tracking payload.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects and transmits system data to external servers without user consent, indicating potentially malicious or at least privacy-invasive behavior. While no active malicious actions are observed, the use of suspicious domains and data collection raises security concerns.",
