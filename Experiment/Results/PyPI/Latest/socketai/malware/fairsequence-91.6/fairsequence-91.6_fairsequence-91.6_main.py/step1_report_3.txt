  "purpose": "Collect system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data encoded in base64 to a set of remote URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system info and MAC addresses, URL encoding via urllib.parse.urlencode.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send HTTP GET requests to remote URLs with system data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info and MAC addresses are collected, encoded in base64, assembled into URL parameters, and transmitted over HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure, non-standard URLs (likely malicious or suspicious domains), encoding system info in base64, sending data to multiple untrusted domains, no validation or encryption of data, no error handling besides passing exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system details, including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, potentially to obfuscate the data. The code constructs URLs with these details as GET parameters and sends requests to external, suspicious domains. The URLs appear to be malicious or at least suspicious, possibly used for tracking or exfiltration. The code suppresses exceptions silently, which prevents detection of failures but indicates intent to hide activity. The presence of multiple URLs and data encoding suggests an attempt to covertly transmit user or system data to external servers, indicating malicious or at least suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system and user information and transmits it to untrusted, suspicious URLs without encryption or user consent. This behavior aligns with data exfiltration or tracking activities, and the code exhibits malicious intent. The overall security risk is high due to data collection and transmission to unknown external domains.",
