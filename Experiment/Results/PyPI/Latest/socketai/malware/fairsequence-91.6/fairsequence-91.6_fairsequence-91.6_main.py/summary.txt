  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, functioning as a covert data exfiltration tool to malicious domains. While it lacks active payloads, its behavior aligns with malicious or privacy-invasive intent. The malware score should be high, and the security risk is significant. The current assessments are appropriate, with a recommendation to consider the malware score around 0.75 and risk score around 0.85."
