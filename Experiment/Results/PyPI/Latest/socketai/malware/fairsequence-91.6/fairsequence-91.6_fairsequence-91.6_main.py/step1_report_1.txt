{
  "purpose": "The code gathers system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, encodes the MAC addresses, and sends this data to multiple external URLs as HTTP GET requests with query parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads input/data from platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), platform.system(), and system commands to retrieve MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP requests to external URLs with system info parameters, which could leak user information if these URLs are malicious.",
  "flows": "System info is collected from various sources, encoded, and then transmitted via GET requests to third-party URLs, potentially leaking sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs that appear suspicious and unrelated to standard package functionality. No clear purpose for transmitting system info. No user consent prompts. Encodes MAC addresses in base64 without user awareness. The URLs are obscure and could be malicious or used for tracking.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses from the system. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains. It sends HTTP GET requests to these URLs with the collected data as query parameters, without any user notification or control. The URLs are obscure and hosted on domains that may be malicious. No data validation, encryption, or security measures are present, and the data transmission could be used for user tracking or data exfiltration. The code lacks any clear legitimate purpose, and the external communication to untrusted domains raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits potentially malicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to obscure external domains without user consent. The domains and data handling suggest a possible data exfiltration or tracking attempt. Although no explicit malware functions like code execution or backdoors are present, the pattern of behavior and suspicious URLs raise security alarms. Overall, this code should be considered high risk.",
