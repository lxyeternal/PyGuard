  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple remote URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system interfaces, and random.randint().",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() called with constructed URLs containing collected data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info collected from sources → encoded (MAC addresses) and assembled into URL parameters → URLs accessed via urllib.request.urlopen().",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple system commands ('getmac', 'ifconfig') to gather MAC addresses, base64 encoding of potentially sensitive MAC data, and sending data to suspicious domains. No explicit hardcoded credentials, but communication with known malicious domains indicates suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers host identification data, including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses obtained via system commands. It encodes the MAC addresses with base64 and constructs URLs with these parameters. The URLs point to domains that are not recognized as legitimate; they appear suspicious and possibly malicious. The code sends data over HTTP to these domains without any form of encryption or authentication, indicating potential data exfiltration. The use of random numbers in URL paths could be to evade detection or tracking. No malicious payloads like reverse shells or data theft beyond info gathering are evident. Overall, the script appears designed for covert data collection and transmission to malicious or suspicious domains.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system data collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious intent. The purpose seems to be gathering system identifiers for tracking or further malicious activities. Although it does not contain direct malware payloads, the data collection and transmission behavior are malicious and pose security risks.",
