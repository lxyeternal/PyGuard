{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and transmits this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple suspicious external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), platform.system(), subprocess.check_output() for system commands, and base64 encoding of MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send HTTP GET requests with collected data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system info and MAC addresses, encoded in base64, then sent via constructed URLs to external servers without validation or encryption.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious, obscure URLs; encoding MAC addresses in base64 (minimal obfuscation); silent exception handling; no user consent or validation; data transmitted over GET requests in plain form.",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert collection of system identifiers and transmits them to external, suspicious domains. It does not execute malicious payloads like code injection or backdoors but exhibits behavior typical of data exfiltration or tracking malware. The minimal obfuscation (base64) offers little resistance to analysis. The silent exception handling suggests an attempt to hide failures. The URLs are obscure and likely malicious. Overall, the behavior indicates high malicious potential centered on privacy invasion and data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, functioning as a covert data exfiltration tool to malicious domains. While it lacks active payloads, its behavior aligns with malicious or privacy-invasive intent. The malware score should be high, and the security risk is significant. The current assessments are appropriate, with a recommendation to consider the malware score around 0.75 and risk score around 0.85.",
