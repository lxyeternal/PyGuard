      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and poses a supply chain security risk. While no malicious code is confirmed, the behavior warrants caution. The scores should reflect a moderate to high risk, with a malware score around 0.4 and a security risk of 0.6, due to the potential for arbitrary code execution."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, functioning as a covert data exfiltration tool to malicious domains. While it lacks active payloads, its behavior aligns with malicious or privacy-invasive intent. The malware score should be high, and the security risk is significant. The current assessments are appropriate, with a recommendation to consider the malware score around 0.75 and risk score around 0.85."
