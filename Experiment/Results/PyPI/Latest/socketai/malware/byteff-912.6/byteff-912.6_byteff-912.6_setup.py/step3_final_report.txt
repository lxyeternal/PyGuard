{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines a custom install class that, during installation, imports and executes the 'main' function from the 'main' module, executing arbitrary code during package installation.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method in 'CrazyInstallStrat' which imports and calls 'main()' from 'main'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during setup, which can run arbitrary, potentially malicious code.",
  "flows": "During package installation, 'install.run(self)' executes, then 'from main import main' and 'main()' are called, executing external code.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of 'main()' during setup; class name 'CrazyInstallStrat' suggests suspicion; no validation or sandboxing.",
  "analysis": "The code unconditionally runs 'main()' after standard installation, which can execute malicious code if 'main()' is harmful. All reports correctly identify this pattern as suspicious. The scores assigned vary but generally reflect high concern; given the pattern, a malware score of approximately 0.75 is justified, as executing arbitrary code during setup is a common supply chain attack vector. The obfuscation score is zero, as the code is straightforward. The security risk score should also be high, around 0.75, due to the potential for malicious code execution. The risk and malware scores are consistent with the behavior, and the pattern warrants caution and further inspection of 'main()'.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant supply chain security risk. The scores should reflect a high malware likelihood (~0.75) and high security risk (~0.75). Without inspecting 'main()', the behavior cannot be confirmed malicious, but it warrants caution and further review.",
