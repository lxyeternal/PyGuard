  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant supply chain security risk. The scores should reflect a high malware likelihood (~0.75) and high security risk (~0.75). Without inspecting 'main()', the behavior cannot be confirmed malicious, but it warrants caution and further review."
