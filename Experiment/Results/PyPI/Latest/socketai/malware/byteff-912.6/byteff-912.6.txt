      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant supply chain security risk. The scores should reflect a high malware likelihood (~0.75) and high security risk (~0.75). Without inspecting 'main()', the behavior cannot be confirmed malicious, but it warrants caution and further review."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating high malicious suspicion and privacy risks. While not containing payloads or obfuscation, its behavior justifies high malware and security risk scores. The activity should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious, warranting caution and further investigation."
