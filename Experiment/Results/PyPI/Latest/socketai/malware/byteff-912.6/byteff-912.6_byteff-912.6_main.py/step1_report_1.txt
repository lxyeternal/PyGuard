  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple external URLs with dynamic parameters, possibly for tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sends HTTP GET requests to external URLs with query parameters containing system info.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered from sources, encoded into URL parameters, and sent via HTTP requests to the listed external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of external domains with suspicious-looking TLDs, dynamic URL construction, inclusion of system info, and sending data without user consent or clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code collects host-specific information (hostname, username, current directory) and a random number, then constructs URLs with these parameters. It then makes HTTP GET requests to potentially malicious or tracking domains, which could be used for device fingerprinting or reconnaissance. The URLs are obfuscated with seemingly random subdomains and TLDs associated with command-and-control or tracking servers. The data transmission occurs without user knowledge. No obfuscated code, malicious payload, or backdoors are present, but the activity itself is suspicious, indicating possible tracking or malicious reconnaissance. The code does not contain obvious malware but is designed to exfiltrate system info to external servers, which could be malicious depending on context.",
  "conclusion": "The script gathers system information and sends it to external URLs, likely for tracking or reconnaissance purposes. While no direct malware is present, the behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially considering the suspicious domains and lack of user consent.",
