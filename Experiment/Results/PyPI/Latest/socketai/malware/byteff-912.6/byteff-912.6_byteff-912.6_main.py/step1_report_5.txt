  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to specified external URLs, possibly for tracking or profiling purposes.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd() - reading hostname, username, current working directory",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() - sending data to external URLs",
  "flows": "sources (hostname, username, current_path) + random number -> URL parameters -> request to external servers",
  "anomalies": "The URLs are suspicious, potentially malicious, and designed to exfiltrate system info. The use of random numbers in URL paths and repeated external network requests without user consent is unusual. No input validation or user notification is present.",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, and current directory, then constructs URLs with these parameters along with a random number. It makes HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains, likely to exfiltrate system info. The domains look suspicious and could be used for malicious tracking or data theft. There are no signs of obfuscation or encryption, but the behavior is covert and privacy-intrusive. No user notification or consent is provided. The code does not perform any malicious system modifications, but the data collection and transmission indicate potentially malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be malicious or at least privacy-intrusive, designed to exfiltrate system information to external servers without user consent. It uses suspicious URLs and gathers sensitive system info, which may be malicious.",
