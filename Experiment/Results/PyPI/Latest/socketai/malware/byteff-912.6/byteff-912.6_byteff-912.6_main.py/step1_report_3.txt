{
  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to remote servers via HTTP GET requests, potentially for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (`platform.node()`), username (`getpass.getuser()`), and current working directory (`os.getcwd()`).",
  "sinks": "Performs HTTP requests to remote URLs with encoded system information as query parameters.",
  "flows": "System info sources → URL parameter encoding → HTTP GET request to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs are suspicious, using obfuscated domain names and a pattern suggestive of data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The code sends system details without user consent, and the URLs are potentially malicious or controlled by an attacker.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, and current directory information. It generates a random number to vary the URL request. It then constructs three URLs pointing to seemingly malicious or suspicious domains, appending system info as URL parameters. The code attempts to connect to each URL and logs responses or errors. The use of hardcoded URLs with obfuscated domains and the transmission of system info without user consent indicates malicious intent or data exfiltration. No input validation or encryption is present. The URLs do not seem to relate to legitimate package functionality, and their patterns suggest malicious command-and-control or tracking activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be malicious, designed to exfiltrate system info to remote servers. It is suspicious and potentially harmful, with no legitimate purpose apparent. The URLs indicate malicious command-and-control or tracking behavior.",
