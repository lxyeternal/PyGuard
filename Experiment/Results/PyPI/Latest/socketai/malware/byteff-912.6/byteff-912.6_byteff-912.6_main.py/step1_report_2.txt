  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, random number) -> URL construction -> HTTP request to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Sending system info to multiple suspicious domains, use of hardcoded URLs, no user consent indication, potential data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system hostname, username, current directory, and a random number. It then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends the collected information via HTTP GET requests. The domains used appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate services, indicating possible malicious intent or tracking. The use of random numbers in the URL path could be for obfuscation or session tracking. No user interaction or explicit consent is present. The code does not perform harmful system modifications but collects and transmits potentially sensitive environment details to external servers, which could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to exfiltrate system information to malicious or suspicious domains without user consent, indicating potential privacy invasion or reconnaissance activity. No evidence of destructive actions or malware presence beyond data collection is observed.",
