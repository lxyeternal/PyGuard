{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process that includes a custom post-installation hook to send system information to a remote URL.",
  "sources": "requests.get('https://api.ipify.org'), platform.node(), platform.system()",
  "sinks": "requests.get(url) with a URL constructed from system data",
  "flows": "platform.node() and platform.system() data are combined and sent via a GET request to a remote webhook URL after installation",
  "anomalies": "The send() function transmits system hostname and OS information to an external URL during installation without user consent. Use of requests in post-install script for data exfiltration is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script utilizes setuptools for package configuration. It defines a post-install command that, upon installation, executes send(). The send() function constructs a URL embedding system hostname and OS name, then performs a GET request to this URL, effectively exfiltrating system details to an external server. This behavior resembles malicious data collection or tracking. The use of requests for remote communication during package installation is unusual and potentially malicious, especially since no user consent is apparent. No other suspicious code or backdoors are evident beyond this data exfiltration step.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious-like behavior where system information is secretly sent to an external server during package installation, indicating potentially malicious intent for data collection or tracking. This behavior is suspicious and likely malicious.",
