  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The scores in the reports are appropriate; I recommend setting malware at 0.8 and security risk at 0.8–0.9 to accurately reflect the severity. The code should be flagged for malicious behavior and removed or remediated before distribution."
