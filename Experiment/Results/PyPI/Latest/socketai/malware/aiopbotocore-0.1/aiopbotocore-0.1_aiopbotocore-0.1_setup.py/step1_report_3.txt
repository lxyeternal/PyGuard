{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up and install a Python package named 'aiopbotocore', and includes a post-installation hook that sends system information to a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via platform.node() and platform.system(), and performs HTTP GET requests to external URLs (https://api.ipify.org and a webhook URL).",
  "sinks": "The send() function constructs a URL with collected data and makes an HTTP GET request to it, potentially transmitting sensitive system info to an external server.",
  "flows": "The system information is collected, concatenated into a URL, and then sent via a GET request to an external webhook URL during the installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a network request during installation to an external webhook URL, which is unusual and suspicious, especially since it transmits system-specific information without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and defines a post-install class that executes a send() function after installation. The send() function retrieves the system's hostname and OS name, then makes two requests: first to an API that returns the public IP address, and second to a webhook URL, passing all data in the URL parameters. This behavior can be used to exfiltrate system information secretly during package installation, which is highly suspicious. There are no hardcoded credentials or malicious code to modify files or perform harmful actions beyond data exfiltration. The use of requests and the network activity during setup is atypical and potentially malicious, indicating possible privacy invasion or supply chain attack.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, specifically data exfiltration of system information during package installation. The behavior is hidden within the setup process, which is unusual for legitimate packages. Overall, the package exhibits high malicious intent risk and should be considered unsafe for use.",
