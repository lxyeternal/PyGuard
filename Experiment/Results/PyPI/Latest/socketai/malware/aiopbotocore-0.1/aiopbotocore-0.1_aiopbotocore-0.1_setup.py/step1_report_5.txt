{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration that includes a post-installation script to send system information to an external webhook URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via platform.node() and platform.system(), and fetches the public IP address using requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').text.",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL, which includes system data, is used in requests.get(url) to send data externally to the specified webhook endpoint.",
  "flows": "Source: platform.node() and platform.system() + requests.get('https://api.ipify.org') -> URL string formation -> requests.get(url) (external HTTP GET request to the webhook URL).",
  "anomalies": "The send() function executes during the post-install phase, sending potentially sensitive system information to an external webhook without user consent. Use of requests.get with dynamically constructed URLs based on system info is suspicious. The code includes side effects during installation, which is unusual for package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package installation behavior. A custom install command is created, which overrides the run() method to execute the send() function after installation. The send() function constructs a URL containing system hostname, OS type, and public IP address, then performs an HTTP GET request to that URL. This behavior effectively exfiltrates system data to an external server without explicit user knowledge. Although technically not malware, this is a privacy violation and could be exploited maliciously. There are no hardcoded credentials or backdoors, but the data exfiltration is suspicious and unusual for a package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs automated exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious from a privacy/security perspective. It should be reviewed and removed or modified to prevent unauthorized data leaks.",
