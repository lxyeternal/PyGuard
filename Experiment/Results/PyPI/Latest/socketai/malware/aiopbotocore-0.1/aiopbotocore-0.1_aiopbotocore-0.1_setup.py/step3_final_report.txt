{
  "purpose": "The code performs data exfiltration by sending system hostname, OS info, and public IP address to an external webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), platform.system(), requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to the constructed URL, transmitting data externally",
  "flows": "Source functions (platform.node(), platform.system(), requests.get) -> URL construction -> requests.get() to external server",
  "anomalies": "Network request during setup, sending system info without user consent, straightforward code with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that executes a send() function. This function collects system hostname, OS, and public IP, then constructs a URL embedding this data and performs a GET request to exfiltrate information. The code is clear, with no obfuscation, but performs covert data transmission during installation. The behavior is suspicious and aligns with malicious exfiltration tactics. The scores in the reports (0.75 to 0.9 malware, high security risk) are justified given the privacy invasion. The code does not contain code injection, backdoors, or destructive actions, but the exfiltration alone warrants high suspicion. The behavior indicates malicious or privacy-invasive intent, especially if undisclosed. The overall assessment is that the code exhibits high malicious potential due to data exfiltration, and the scores should reflect this.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The scores in the reports are appropriate; I recommend setting malware at 0.8 and security risk at 0.8–0.9 to accurately reflect the severity. The code should be flagged for malicious behavior and removed or remediated before distribution.",
