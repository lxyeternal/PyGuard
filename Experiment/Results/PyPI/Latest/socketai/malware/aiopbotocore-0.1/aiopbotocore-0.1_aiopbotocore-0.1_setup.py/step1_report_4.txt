{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package that includes a post-installation step to send system information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "requests.get('https://api.ipify.org') to obtain public IP, platform.node() and platform.system() for system info, URL construction with these data.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to the constructed URL, which sends collected data to an external server.",
  "flows": "After installation, send() is called, which retrieves IP and system info, constructs a URL with these data, and makes a GET request to that URL, transmitting potentially sensitive information.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration upon package installation without user consent, use of external webhook, collection of system info and IP address without transparency, and no clear purpose for this data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script installs a Python package 'aiopbotocore' and includes a custom post-install command that executes the 'send()' function. This function gathers system hostname, OS info, and public IP address, then constructs a URL to send this data via a GET request to a specific webhook URL. The data exfiltration occurs automatically during installation, with no user notification or consent. The code uses common libraries but performs an unsolicited network request to a third-party server, which is suspicious behavior. The overall design indicates an attempt to secretly collect and transmit system information, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external server during package installation without user consent. This constitutes a security concern and indicates potential supply chain compromise or malicious intent.",
