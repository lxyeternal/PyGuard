{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup configuration that includes a custom post-installation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the system (platform.node() and platform.system()), and makes HTTP requests to external URLs (requests.get).",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL with system info is used to make an HTTP GET request to an external webhook URL, potentially transmitting system data.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname and OS) is concatenated into a URL, then a GET request is sent to that URL, transmitting system data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The send() function performs data exfiltration during installation by sending system hostname and OS information to an external webhook, which is unusual for typical setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities and defines a function 'send' that, when called, outputs a message and sends system info to an external URL via a GET request. The custom install command runs this function after installation. The setup configuration specifies package details and overrides the install command with this custom class. The use of requests to send system info to an external webhook during package installation is suspicious, as it may be used for tracking or data exfiltration, which is not standard behavior. No other malicious activities or suspicious obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains code that exfiltrates system information to an external webhook during installation, which is a malicious or at least suspicious behavior. This behavior could be used for tracking or malicious data collection, indicating malicious intent or security risk.",
