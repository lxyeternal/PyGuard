{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'cryptocalls' Python package",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and package list",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; no sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only defines static package metadata",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be a standard setup script with no unusual or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with static package information. All data is hardcoded and typical for package distribution. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no embedded code, and no suspicious patterns. The description field contains 'None', which is unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward package setup script without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
