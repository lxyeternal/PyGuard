  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'cryptocalls' Python module.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() function parameters such as name, version, author, description, and packages list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or external data handling; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static, hardcoded parameters. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network or file operations. The data appears to be standard package metadata, and no malicious or maliciously obfuscated logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for open-source distribution.",
