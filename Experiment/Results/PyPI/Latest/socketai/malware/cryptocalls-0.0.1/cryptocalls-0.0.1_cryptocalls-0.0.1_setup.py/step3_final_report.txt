  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools with static metadata.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static parameters in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; static code.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Description field contains 'None', which is unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward setup script for packaging a Python module. It contains only static, hardcoded metadata with no dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. All provided reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm the absence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores and analysis are accurate and consistent with the code content. No modifications or further investigations are necessary.",
