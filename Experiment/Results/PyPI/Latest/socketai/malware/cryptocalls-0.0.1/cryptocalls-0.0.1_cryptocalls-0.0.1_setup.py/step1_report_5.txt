  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'cryptocalls' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static configuration parameters for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No potential sinks; no data leaks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or unusual code; straightforward use of setuptools.setup with static metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static parameters defining package name, version, author, description, and included packages. There are no dynamic or hidden code behaviors, no input handling, nor any external data processing. The script is a standard packaging configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for packaging a Python module. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears benign and intended solely for package distribution.",
