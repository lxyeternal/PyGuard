The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this behavior, with malware likelihood at 0.9 and security risk at 0.9. No obfuscation is present, but the immediate execution of external code without validation poses a significant threat."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors indicative of malicious activity, specifically downloading and executing an external binary without validation. Given the pattern and context, it is highly likely to be malicious or part of a supply chain attack. The malware score should be set to 1, and the security risk score should be very high, close to 1, reflecting the dangerous nature of this pattern."
