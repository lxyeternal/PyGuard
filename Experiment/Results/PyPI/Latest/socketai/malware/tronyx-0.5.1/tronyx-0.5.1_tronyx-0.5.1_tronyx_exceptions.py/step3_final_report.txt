{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a blockchain or transaction system.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions, no input/output or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "None; purely structural class definitions without executable code or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with clear naming.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from standard Python exception classes. There are no input/output operations, data processing, external interactions, or dynamic code execution. The class names suggest use in blockchain or transaction contexts. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code is purely structural, serving as error categorization within a larger system. Given the absence of executable logic or external interactions, there are no security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of custom exception class definitions intended for error handling in a blockchain or transaction system. It poses no security threat or malicious risk.",
