  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error handling scenarios within a larger application or SDK.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; purely class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or data leaks; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; classes are only definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions without unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception class definitions, inheriting from built-in exception types such as ValueError and Exception. These classes serve as specific error indicators for different error conditions like address errors, key errors, signature issues, and not found errors related to transactions, blocks, assets, etc. The code does not perform any input/output, network operations, or data processing. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. All classes are simple, standard Python class definitions intended for error handling within a larger framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely defines custom exception classes for error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a straightforward, non-malicious implementation.",
