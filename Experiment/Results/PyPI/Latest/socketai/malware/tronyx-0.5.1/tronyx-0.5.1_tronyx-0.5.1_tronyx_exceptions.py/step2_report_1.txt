  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are observed.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, inheriting from standard Python exceptions, with clear naming indicating their purpose in blockchain or transaction contexts.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are identified.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code appears to be purely structural, serving as error categorization within a larger system.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), given the static and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- No issues or anomalies are detected in the reports.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the conclusions are justified.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Since the code is benign and purely structural, no changes to scores are necessary.\n- The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk or attack surface present.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions for error handling in a blockchain or transaction system. It poses no security threat or malicious risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores; the code is safe and non-malicious.",
