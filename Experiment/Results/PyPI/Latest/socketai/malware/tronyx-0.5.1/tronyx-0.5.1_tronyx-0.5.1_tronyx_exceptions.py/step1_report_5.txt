  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a blockchain or transaction-related application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No data flow or untrusted data handling; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as this is solely class definitions for exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward class inheritance for custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple class definitions inheriting from built-in exception types. These classes serve as custom error types for specific error conditions, such as bad addresses, keys, signatures, hashes, transaction issues, and not found errors, among others. There is no dynamic code execution, data handling, or suspicious logic present. The code is purely structural and for error categorization without any malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions used for error handling in a blockchain or transaction processing context. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leakage, and no suspicious activities.",
