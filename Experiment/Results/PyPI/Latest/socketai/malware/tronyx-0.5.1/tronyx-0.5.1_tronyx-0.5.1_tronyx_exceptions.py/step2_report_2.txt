  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from standard Python exception classes.\n- No input/output, data processing, external interactions, or dynamic code.\n- Class names suggest use in blockchain or transaction contexts.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is just class definitions with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves as a structural component for error handling.\n- No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident in the summaries.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the benign nature.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only defines exception classes with no executable or external interaction, the risk score should remain at **0**.\n- No reason to assign higher scores unless future use introduces vulnerabilities, which is outside the scope of this static analysis.\n\n### Claims about vulnerabilities:\n- The reports correctly challenge any assumptions of malicious behavior; they find none.\n- The class definitions are standard and do not introduce security issues.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is purely structural, defining exception classes.  \n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.  \n- No obfuscation or hidden logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. They correctly identify that this code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe and non-malicious.",
