  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, code content, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No input/output, data processing, network interactions, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The class hierarchy and naming conventions suggest use in a blockchain or transaction system.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The malware score is consistently zero across all reports.\n- The security risk score is zero, reflecting no identified vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Code Content\n\n**Does the code contain any malicious or suspicious elements?**  \n**Answer:** No. The code only defines custom exception classes with no logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports\n\n**Are there any errors or flawed reasoning?**  \n**Answer:** No. All reports correctly identify that these are straightforward class definitions for error handling, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Their Reasonableness\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is appropriate given the code content.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0. This is justified since the code is purely structural, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Are any score adjustments needed?**  \n**Answer:** No. The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Higher Risk Scores\n\n**Would a higher risk score be justified?**  \n**Answer:** No. The code is purely definitional and does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Assumptions and Claims\n\n- Some reports mention the context (blockchain, transaction processing). These are logical assumptions based on class names but do not impact security assessment.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities or exploits are based on assumptions; the analysis correctly states the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Personal Scores\n\nGiven the thorough review:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions for error handling in a blockchain or transaction system. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0). The code is safe and purely structural.\n\n---\n\n**Work-through conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the code is non-malicious. No further action or scoring adjustments are necessary.",
