  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a blockchain or transaction-related application.",
  "sources": "No input data reading or data sources in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows between sources and sinks; this code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs detected; all classes are straightforward exception subclasses with no embedded logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions, mainly for error categorization in a blockchain or transaction system. There are no data inputs, outputs, or manipulative operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior indicators are present. The classes are purely declarative, serving as custom exception types to be used elsewhere in the application.",
  "conclusion": "This source code contains only standard custom exception class definitions for a blockchain or transaction system and poses no security risk or malicious behavior. It is a straightforward, non-suspicious set of class declarations.",
