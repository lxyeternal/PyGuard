  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python project.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; exception class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow as the code only defines classes without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various custom exceptions, all inheriting from standard Python exception classes. There are no input sources, data processing, or external interactions. The class hierarchy appears straightforward and conventional, with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs. The classes are likely used for structured error handling within a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions intended for error handling. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are present. It appears to be purely structural without any code that could be exploited or cause harm.",
