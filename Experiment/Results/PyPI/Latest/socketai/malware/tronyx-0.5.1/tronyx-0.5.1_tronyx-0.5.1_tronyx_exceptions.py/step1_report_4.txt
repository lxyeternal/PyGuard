{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a larger Python project, likely related to blockchain or transaction processing.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception inheritance structures; no input or data reading occurring.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external system interaction; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily class inheritance for error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a series of custom exception classes, inheriting from built-in Python exceptions such as ValueError and Exception. The naming suggests use in a blockchain or transaction context (e.g., BadAddress, DoubleSpending). No external data handling, network operations, or malicious patterns are observed. The structure is straightforward and typical for error categorization. No suspicious or malicious code, no embedded logic beyond class declarations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for an application likely related to blockchain or transaction validation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a benign module intended for structured error handling.",
