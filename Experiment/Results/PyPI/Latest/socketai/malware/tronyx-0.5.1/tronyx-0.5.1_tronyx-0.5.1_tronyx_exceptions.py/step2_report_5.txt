  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - There are no signs of input handling, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign, purely structural, and used for error handling.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:\n   - Since the code is only class definitions with no dynamic or executable logic, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The risk scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities present)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a benign, standard set of custom exception class definitions for error handling in a blockchain or transaction system. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n**Recommendation**: No changes needed. The current scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
