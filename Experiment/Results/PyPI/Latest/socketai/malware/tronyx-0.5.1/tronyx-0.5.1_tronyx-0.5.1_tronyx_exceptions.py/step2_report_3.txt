  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, inheriting from standard Python exceptions, and serve as error indicators in a larger system.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, embedded logic, or security risks are evident.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code appears to be purely structural, designed for error handling in a blockchain or transaction system.\n- The exception hierarchy is conventional and standard.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are all zero, aligning with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified given the absence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n- The overall security risk is 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious activities are present.\n- The confidence score is 1, reflecting a high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- Given the unanimous agreement and thorough analysis, the scores seem appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n**My own evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for error handling in a blockchain or transaction system. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores assigned are accurate and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
