  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script.\n- It uses `importlib` to load version info from `tronyx/version.py`.\n- Reads `README.md` for long description.\n- Defines dependencies and package metadata.\n- No untrusted data, network activity, or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns are detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review:**\n\n#### **Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code performs typical setup operations.\n- No malicious or suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Dynamic import of version info is standard.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard package setup.\n- **Sources:** Reads version info and README.\n- **Sinks:** None.\n- **Flows:** Static data; no untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** All standard, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.1) is reasonable, given the setup context. Malware=0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with the same reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- Same pattern, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- Same analysis.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All correctly assign 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal security risk typical of setup scripts.\n\n**Any adjustments?**  \n- The risk scores could be uniformly set to 0, as no real security concerns are present. The small 0.1 in report 1 is acceptable but perhaps slightly overestimating; however, it's minor.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores are reasonable, though a uniform risk score of 0 might be more appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Set security risk to 0 across all reports.\n\nThis analysis confirms the code's benign nature.",
