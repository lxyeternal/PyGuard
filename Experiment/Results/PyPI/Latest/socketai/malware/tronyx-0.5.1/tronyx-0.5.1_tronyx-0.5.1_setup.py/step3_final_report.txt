  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'tronyx' library, defining dependencies, metadata, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'tronyx/version.py' and long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from local files into setup configuration; no untrusted source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and follows common patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup operations: dynamic import of version info, reading static files, defining dependencies, and invoking setuptools.setup(). No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The dependencies are standard, and no network or user input is involved. The dynamic import is a common pattern for version management. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and free from security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard, safe, and contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 (or 0.1 for minimal inherent risk) are justified and should be maintained.",
