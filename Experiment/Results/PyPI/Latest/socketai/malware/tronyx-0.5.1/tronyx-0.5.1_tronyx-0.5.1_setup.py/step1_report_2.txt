{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for building and installing the 'tronyx' Python package, including dependency specifications and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'version.py' for version info, reading 'README.md' for long description, and static assignment of dependencies and package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; all data sources are static or controlled file reads, used for package setup.",
  "flows": "Static data from version module and README file flows into package setup configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports version information, reads documentation for long description, and defines package metadata and dependencies. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No obfuscated code, no external data sources, and no suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It only performs typical package configuration tasks as intended.",
