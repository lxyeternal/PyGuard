{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'tronyx', specifying its dependencies, metadata, and version information for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version from an external Python file ('tronyx/version.py'), reads the 'README.md' file for the long description, and loads dependencies from static lists.",
  "sinks": "The setup function uses the gathered metadata and dependencies to configure the package; no direct data sinks involving untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "Version info from 'tronyx/version.py' flows into setup; the 'README.md' content flows into long_description; static dependency lists flow into setup_kwargs; finally, setup() is called with all parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or hidden backdoors observed. Use of 'importlib' for dynamic module import is standard in this context. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or external network calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads version information from a separate file, which is a common pattern to keep versioning consistent. It reads static dependency lists and package metadata for setup. There are no inputs from external untrusted sources during execution. The only file reads are from trusted files ('README.md' and 'tronyx/version.py'), and the process is straightforward. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard package setup routine with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It adheres to best practices for Python package configuration. The overall security risk is minimal.",
