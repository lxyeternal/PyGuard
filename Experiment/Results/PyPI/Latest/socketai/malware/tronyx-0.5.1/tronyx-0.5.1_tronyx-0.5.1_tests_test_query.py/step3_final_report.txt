{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test functions for the 'tronyx' Python library, querying the Tron blockchain for account balances, transaction info, and event logs, using hardcoded test data.",
  "sources": "Reads data from blockchain API calls such as get_account_asset_balances, get_transaction_info, get_contract, and event processing functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only read-only API responses are processed, with no data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "flows": "Source functions retrieve blockchain data; data flows into assertions for validation, with no untrusted input influencing control flow or system state.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing standard read-only API calls to a public blockchain, with hardcoded test data. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior is present. The tests are designed to validate the client library's functionality, not to execute untrusted code or perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are accurate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
