{
  "purpose": "Unit testing cryptographic key operations, signature verification, and address conversions in a blockchain context.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include fixtures such as txid, raw_data, pub_key, signature, address, and hardcoded hex strings used for key and signature creation.",
  "sinks": "Function calls such as recover_public_key_from_msg_hash, verify_msg, sign_msg, sign_msg_hash, to_base58check_address, and various assertions, which process or output cryptographic data and addresses.",
  "flows": "Input fixtures and hardcoded keys/signatures are used to generate keys, sign messages, recover public keys, verify signatures, and convert addresses. Data flows from source fixtures to cryptographic functions and assertions, with no external network or file I/O involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets appear to be malicious; all key data are static test fixtures. No suspicious or obfuscated code, backdoors, or external data leaks are detected. The code adheres to standard cryptographic testing procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of unit tests verifying cryptographic functionalities such as key generation, signature signing, public key recovery, and address conversion. All data used are test fixtures with fixed values, not external inputs. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are present. The functions tested are typical for blockchain cryptography validation and do not perform any suspicious or harmful operations. The absence of network I/O, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated constructs supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard cryptographic unit tests with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads. The overall security risk is minimal.",
