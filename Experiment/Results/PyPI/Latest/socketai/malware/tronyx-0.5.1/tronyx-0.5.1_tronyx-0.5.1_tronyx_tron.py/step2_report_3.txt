  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing their findings with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard TRON blockchain client library with no signs of malicious activity. It reads user inputs, interacts with external APIs, signs messages, and manages transactions securely.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a legitimate SDK. No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The low security risk score aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n**Verdict:** The score is reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a comprehensive, standard blockchain client. No signs of malicious intent, secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The evaluation is consistent with the code's structure. The very low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard blockchain client with no signs of malicious activity. Handles private keys, network requests, and data securely.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The assessment is aligned with the code. No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, confirming that the code is a legitimate SDK with no malicious signs.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: a standard, secure blockchain client library with no malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code contains no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert channels.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate no obfuscation, which matches the code clarity.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), but all are low, reflecting the code's legitimate functions and proper error handling.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, open-source-like SDK for TRON blockchain interaction.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- External API interactions are typical for such SDKs.\n- Cryptographic signing is standard, with no suspicious data flows.\n- Error handling is explicit and appropriate.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, due to external API dependencies but no inherent security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears safe and legitimate, with scores reflecting a low security risk profile.",
