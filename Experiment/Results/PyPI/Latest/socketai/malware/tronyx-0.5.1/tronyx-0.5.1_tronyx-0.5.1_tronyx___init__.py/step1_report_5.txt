  "purpose": "Import specific classes and constants from the 'tronyx' package for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'tronyx' modules and package variables (__all__).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code is limited to imports and constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports modules and classes from a third-party package 'tronyx' and defines constants for TRX and SUN. There are no input handling, data processing, or external network interactions present. The __all__ list specifies exports for module use. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module that imports classes and defines constants without any malicious or security-risk behavior. It appears to be safe and serves as an interface or setup component.",
