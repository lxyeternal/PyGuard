  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code imports classes/constants from 'tronyx', defines constants, and exports symbols. No dynamic or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard import and constant definitions.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—imports and constants, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; straightforward imports and constants.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; only imports and constants.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** No signs of obfuscation.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The code is static, with no user input, network calls, or data processing.\n- **Scores consistency:** All scores are zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard module setup, importing classes from a third-party library and defining constants.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- The high confidence scores (mostly 1) are justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code appears benign and typical for a library interface module.",
