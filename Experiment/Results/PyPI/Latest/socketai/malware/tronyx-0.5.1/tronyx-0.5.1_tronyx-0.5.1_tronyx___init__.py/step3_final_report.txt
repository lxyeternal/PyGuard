{
  "purpose": "Module setup importing classes from 'tronyx' blockchain library and defining constants for denominations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'tronyx' package, constants TRX and SUN, __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and constants are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; straightforward static code.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports classes from a third-party library, defines blockchain denomination constants, and sets export symbols. There are no dynamic or malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no network activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the benign nature of the code. The reports correctly identify the code as a standard, safe module setup without vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
