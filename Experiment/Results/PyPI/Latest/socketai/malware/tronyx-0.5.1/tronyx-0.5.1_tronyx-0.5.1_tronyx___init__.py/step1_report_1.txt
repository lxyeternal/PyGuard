{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes and constants related to the Tronyx library for interacting with Tron blockchain components and defines public API exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'tronyx' package; definition of constants TRX and SUN",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs; constants are hardcoded, and imports are static",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs; the code only defines constants and imports modules",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; simple import and constant definitions",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes from the 'tronyx' package, which appears to be a library for interacting with the Tron blockchain. It defines two constants, TRX and SUN, representing blockchain denominations, and specifies exported symbols. There is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity. The code is straightforward and primarily structural, setting up module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no malicious behavior detected. It imports library components, defines constants, and sets exports, all in a typical manner for a Python package interface.",
