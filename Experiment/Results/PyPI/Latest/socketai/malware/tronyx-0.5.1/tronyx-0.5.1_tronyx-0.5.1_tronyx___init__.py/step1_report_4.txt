{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes and constants from the 'tronyx' library and defines a list of exported names, likely to be used in a larger application related to blockchain operations on Tron.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'tronyx' modules and the assignment of constants TRX and SUN",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission present",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks; imports and constant definitions are static",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements from a third-party library and the definition of constants. It does not include any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing that could be malicious. The constants are simple numeric values used for blockchain token calculations. The imports suggest usage of blockchain interaction classes, but in this snippet, they are only imported and exported. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It imports necessary classes and defines constants for blockchain operations without any suspicious behavior.",
