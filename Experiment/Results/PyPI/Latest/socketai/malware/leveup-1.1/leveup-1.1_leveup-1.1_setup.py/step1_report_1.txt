{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'leveup' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata (name, version, author, email, description, classifiers). No external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The code only performs package setup configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static configuration without runtime data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools and calls setup() with fixed package metadata. It does not contain any dynamic code, user input handling, or network operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The code is typical boilerplate for packaging a Python project and does not exhibit any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use and contains no anomalous or suspicious elements.",
