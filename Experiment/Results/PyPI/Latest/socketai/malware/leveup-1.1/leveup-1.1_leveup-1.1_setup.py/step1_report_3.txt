{
  "purpose": "Configure the packaging setup for the Python project 'leveup' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools module (setuptools), function calls to setup() and find_packages().",
  "targets": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static metadata parameters such as name, version, author, description, and classifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling, no network connections, or other typical malicious indicators. The use of 'find_packages()' is standard to automatically include packages. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project, with no malicious or suspicious behaviors detected. It performs standard package configuration without any security risks.",
