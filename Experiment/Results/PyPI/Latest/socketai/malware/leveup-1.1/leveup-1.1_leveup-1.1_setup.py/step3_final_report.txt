  "purpose": "Static setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields: name, version, author, author_email, description, classifiers; call to find_packages().",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or dynamic processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard boilerplate for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup script with fixed strings and a call to find_packages(). It contains no dynamic input, network operations, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present, and the code is typical for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores and analysis are accurate and justified.",
