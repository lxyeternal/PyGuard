  "sinks": "requests.get() to external server, subprocess.run() executing reverse shell command",
  "flows": "Gather hostname, cwd, username -> send data via HTTP GET request -> execute reverse shell command",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of reverse shell command, data exfiltration to a suspicious domain, execution of potentially malicious code during install",
  "analysis": "The code collects system info and immediately exfiltrates it to an external server. It then executes a reverse shell command, which connects to a remote host, potentially allowing remote control over the compromised system. These actions are performed during the installation process, indicating malicious intent or backdoor access. The external URL appears suspicious and is likely used for command and control or data exfiltration. The reverse shell command is hardcoded, making it a deliberate malicious action.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information and establishing a reverse shell connection during package installation. This indicates a clear security threat and potential backdoor access. The package should be considered malicious and unsafe to use.",
