  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that executes custom installation routines.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() for system info; requests.get() for external network request; subprocess.run() for executing shell commands.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() sending data to a remote URL; subprocess.run() executing a reverse shell command.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, cwd, username) -> HTTP GET request to external server; Reverse shell command -> system shell execution",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of requests.get() to transmit system info to a suspicious URL; execution of a reverse shell command during installation, which is highly atypical and malicious in a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to an external server via an HTTP GET request, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration. More concerning is the execution of a reverse shell command that attempts to connect back to a remote server, granting the attacker shell access to the compromised system. Both actions are characteristic of malicious behavior, especially embedded within a package installation routine. No legitimate use case justifies executing such commands during package setup. The use of subprocess with a hardcoded reverse shell command is particularly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information and establishing a reverse shell connection during package installation. This indicates a high probability of malicious intent and security risk.",
