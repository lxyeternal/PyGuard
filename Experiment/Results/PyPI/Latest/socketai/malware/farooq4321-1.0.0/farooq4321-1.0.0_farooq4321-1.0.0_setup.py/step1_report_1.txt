{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, performs network communication and executes a reverse shell.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username; it also executes a subprocess command.",
  "sinks": "Requests to an external URL with collected data, and execution of a reverse shell command via subprocess.",
  "flows": "The system info collected (hostname, cwd, username) flows from the source section to the requests.get call (sink), and the reverse shell command executes directly after installation (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a network request to a suspicious domain and executes a reverse shell, which is highly unusual and malicious in intent. The reverse shell command is hardcoded and executes during installation, indicating malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script hooks into the setup process via a custom install class. It collects host info (hostname, cwd, username), then sends this data to an external, suspicious URL. Immediately after, it executes a reverse shell command, opening a persistent backdoor. These actions are typical of malicious code aimed at system compromise and data exfiltration. No benign purpose justifies such behavior in a package install context.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior: exfiltrating system information and opening a reverse shell during installation. It is highly likely designed for unauthorized access and system compromise.",
