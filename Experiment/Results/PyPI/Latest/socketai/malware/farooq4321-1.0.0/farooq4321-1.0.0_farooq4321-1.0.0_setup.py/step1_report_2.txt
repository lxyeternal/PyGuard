{
  "purpose": "Customize package installation process to collect system information and establish a reverse shell connection.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() for system info; requests.get() for network data transmission; subprocess.run() for executing shell commands.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, cwd, username) -> requests.get() to external URL; shell command string -> subprocess.run() to execute reverse shell.",
  "anomalies": "Sends collected system info to an external server; executes a reverse shell command that connects back to a remote host; hardcoded URL and shell command suggest malicious intent; no user consent or security checks.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the setuptools install process with a custom class. During installation, it gathers system info such as hostname, current directory, and username, then exfiltrates this data to an external URL, which could be malicious. Additionally, it runs a hardcoded reverse shell command that connects back to a remote server, potentially allowing remote control of the system. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious activity aimed at data theft and remote system access. The use of subprocess with shell=True and hardcoded commands strongly indicates malicious intent, as it bypasses typical security measures. The code does not sanitize inputs or verify the target server, increasing risk. The overall pattern shows clear signs of malware activity intended for unauthorized system access and data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, including data exfiltration and remote backdoor access via reverse shell. It is highly suspicious and should be considered dangerous for use.",
