The other reports are consistent with safe code. The overall assessment indicates low to moderate risk, primarily driven by dynamic code execution concerns in Report 2."

      "conclusion": "The code pattern is highly risky, with a high likelihood of malicious intent if the remote script is untrusted. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.85, security risk ~0.9) are justified. It is strongly recommended to avoid executing remote scripts without proper validation, checksum, or signature verification to mitigate supply chain and malware risks."
