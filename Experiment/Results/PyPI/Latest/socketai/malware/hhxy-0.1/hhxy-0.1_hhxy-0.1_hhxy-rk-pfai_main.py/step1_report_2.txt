No error handling or verification is implemented. The script is run directly after download without checks.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The script uses subprocess.run to download a remote shell script via wget, then modifies its permissions to make it executable, and finally runs the script. There are no input validations or security checks. The URL is hardcoded, and the script is executed immediately after download. This pattern can be exploited to execute malicious code if the URL is compromised or if the remote script is malicious. The lack of validation or authentication mechanisms indicates high security risk. The use of subprocess for executing external commands is standard, but the lack of verification makes this behavior potentially dangerous.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is potentially malicious as it downloads and executes an external shell script without validation, which could lead to execution of arbitrary and malicious commands. It represents a high security risk and should be reviewed carefully, especially regarding the trustworthiness of the remote script.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0.75,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.8\n}",
