  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, user input, files, and standard modules; potential dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network connections, environment variables, file system, or other external interfaces.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment, user input) potentially flow into eval/exec or system calls, leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec without validation, unvalidated inputs, dynamic code execution, or obscure variable usage; otherwise no obfuscation or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code shows typical data handling with no signs of malicious activity in most reports. Report 2 indicates potential dynamic code execution, which is a security concern. The malware score in Report 2 should be increased from 0.2 to 0.6 to reflect the risk posed by eval/exec usage. Other reports are consistent with benign code, with scores appropriately low. The overall security risk in Report 2 is elevated due to the potential for malicious exploitation. No obfuscation is observed across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risks. Report 2's use of eval/exec warrants a higher malware score (0.6) and security risk (0.5). The other reports are consistent with safe code. The overall assessment indicates low to moderate risk, primarily driven by dynamic code execution concerns in Report 2.",
