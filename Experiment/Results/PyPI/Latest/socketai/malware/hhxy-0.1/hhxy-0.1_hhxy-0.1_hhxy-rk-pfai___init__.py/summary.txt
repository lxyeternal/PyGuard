  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risks. Report 2's use of eval/exec warrants a higher malware score (0.6) and security risk (0.5). The other reports are consistent with safe code. The overall assessment indicates low to moderate risk, primarily driven by dynamic code execution concerns in Report 2."
