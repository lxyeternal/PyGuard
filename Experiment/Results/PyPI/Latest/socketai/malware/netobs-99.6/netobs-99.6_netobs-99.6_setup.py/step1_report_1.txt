{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'netobs' package, including a custom installation step that executes code after installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules ('setuptools', 'requests', 'psutil') and dynamically imports and executes 'main.m()' during installation.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of 'm()' from 'main' occurs as a post-install step, which could execute arbitrary code if 'main.py' is malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method calls 'install.run(self)' and then imports 'm' from 'main' and executes it, creating a source-to-sink flow where arbitrary code can be executed post-install.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' executes code ('from main import m' and 'm()') after installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code. No other suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration with a custom install class that overrides 'run'. The key concern is that after standard installation, it imports 'm' from 'main' and executes 'm()'. This post-install behavior can be exploited to run malicious code if 'main.py' is malicious or has been tampered with. The rest of the setup code appears standard, requiring 'requests' and 'psutil'. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The code’s suspicious behavior lies solely in the execution of external code ('m()') after installation, which is unusual and potentially dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a potentially malicious post-installation execution step that runs 'main.m()' after installing the package. This behavior could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the target system. While the setup appears standard otherwise, the post-install code execution is a significant security concern.",
