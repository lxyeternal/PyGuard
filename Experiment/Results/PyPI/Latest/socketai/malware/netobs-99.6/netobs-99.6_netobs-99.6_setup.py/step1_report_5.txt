{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration with a custom installation step that executes a function from main.py post-installation.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method of CrazyInstallStrat class calls 'from main import m' and then executes m().",
  "sinks": "Execution of the function m() imported from main.py after installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code imports 'm' from main and runs it, which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class automatically runs a function 'm()' after installation without any validation or checks; the function 'm()' could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, upon execution, imports a function 'm' from main.py and executes it immediately. This behavior occurs every time the package is installed, potentially running malicious or unwanted code without user consent. No security checks or validations are performed on 'm()', and it is unclear what 'm()' does, representing a significant security concern. The rest of the setup code appears standard, but the automatic execution of external code during install is suspicious and can be exploited to run malicious code during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a malicious pattern where a function 'm()' from main.py is executed automatically during package installation, potentially executing arbitrary or malicious code. This behavior is suspicious and poses a security risk.",
