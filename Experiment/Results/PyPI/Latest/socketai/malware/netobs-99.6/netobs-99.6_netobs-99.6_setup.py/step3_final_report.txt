{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines a custom installation class that, during installation, imports and executes a function 'm()' from 'main', which can run arbitrary code.",
  "sources": "The code reads data during the import of 'main' and the execution of 'm()' in the 'run()' method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'm()' after installation, which could execute malicious or unintended code.",
  "flows": "During installation: 'install.run()' -> import 'main' -> call 'm()'.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external code ('m()') during setup without validation or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a custom install class that, after completing the standard installation, imports 'm' from 'main' and executes it. This pattern is highly unusual and risky, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The primary concern is that 'm()' could contain malicious code, leading to potential system compromise. Given the pattern, the risk of malicious activity is high, especially if 'main.py' is malicious or tampered with. The scores should reflect this, with malware and security risk scores near 0.9, and obfuscation remaining at 0.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script executes external code ('m()' from 'main') during installation, which is a significant security risk and can be exploited for malicious purposes. The pattern is suspicious and should be flagged as highly insecure unless the code is fully trusted and verified.",
