  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to remote servers via encoded URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads system info (platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), generates random number, reads network interfaces for MAC addresses, decodes URLs.",
  "sinks": "URL requests to remote servers constructed with system info, potentially leaking sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Source functions (system info, username, current directory, MAC addresses) -> encode and include as URL parameters -> send HTTP requests to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation of URLs with base64 encoding, collection and transmission of potentially sensitive system data without user consent, silent failure handling. Use of hardcoded URLs decoded from base64 suggests obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code collects host-specific details such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes the MAC addresses with base64. It constructs URLs with three known remote domains (decoded from base64), appending system information as URL parameters. The requests are made without handling responses or errors meaningfully, and no user notification occurs. The URLs are likely external endpoints, possibly used for tracking or data exfiltration. The code's behavior suggests it could be used for tracking or reconnaissance, especially considering the obfuscated URLs and silent operation. No obvious malicious payload (like executing system commands or self-modification) is present, but the data collection and transmission to external servers raise privacy and security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system information and transmits it to external URLs, which could be used for tracking or data exfiltration. The obfuscated URLs and silent HTTP requests indicate suspicious activity. No direct malware behavior such as malicious payload execution is evident, but the data harvesting and communication pattern are concerning from a security perspective.",
