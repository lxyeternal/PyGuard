  "purpose": "Collect system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory, and send this data to remote URLs as part of a reporting or telemetry function.",
  "sources": "Reading system info via platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), and random.randint(); data encoding from base64; network requests to external URLs using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "sinks": "Sending HTTP GET requests with system data embedded as URL parameters to external servers, which can leak sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, user info, current directory, MAC addresses) are gathered, encoded, and then appended as URL parameters in requests to remote URLs; responses are ignored, but requests are made.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded URLs which decode to external domains; collection of MAC addresses and environment details without explicit user consent; silent network requests with exception handling that suppresses errors. No explicit hardcoded credentials, but data collection and transmission patterns are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system identifiers (MAC addresses, hostname, username), current directory, and generates a random number. It encodes MAC addresses in base64. It constructs URLs by decoding base64-encoded domains and appends collected data as query parameters. The URLs suggest remote endpoints possibly used for telemetry or malicious exfiltration. Network requests are made silently with exception handling, which can obscure failures. No malicious code such as data theft, reverse shells, or damaging actions is directly observed. The pattern of data collection and transmission, especially to external URLs, is suspicious and could be used for tracking or data exfiltration. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are evident, but the behavior warrants security concern due to data collection and remote communication.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects various system identifiers and sends them to remote servers via HTTP GET requests, which could be used for surveillance or malicious data exfiltration. Although no explicit malicious actions like file damage or backdoors are present, the data collection and transmission pattern is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially if deployed without user consent.",
