  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to external URLs for potential tracking or data collection.",
  "sources": "getuser() from getpass, node() from platform, current working directory from os, check_output() from subprocess, base64 decoding, random number generation, input URLs (embedded as base64).",
  "sinks": "ur.urlopen() to send data over HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "flows": "Gather system info -> encode data -> construct URLs with parameters -> send HTTP requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 to encode URLs; data collection of MAC addresses, hostname, username, directory; no explicit user consent handling; silently ignoring exceptions during network requests.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system-specific data such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. It encodes the list of MAC addresses in base64 before including it in request parameters. The URLs are also base64-encoded, which may be to obscure their targets. The code then sends HTTP GET requests to three different external URLs with these parameters, without handling responses or errors. The collection of system information and silent transmission to remote servers without user knowledge or consent indicates malicious intent related to user tracking or data exfiltration. The use of silent exception handling further suggests obfuscation or concealment of network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to silently collect and transmit detailed system information to external servers. Its behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking activity, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. There are no indications of benign functionality or user-initiated actions; combined with URL obfuscation, this suggests malicious intent.",
