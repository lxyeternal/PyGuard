  "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing external code during installation poses a moderate to high security risk, depending on 'main()' content. The current scores are appropriate but could be slightly increased to reflect the inherent danger of executing untrusted code during package installation. It is recommended to review 'main.py' before trusting this package."
