{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'imagedreamfusion' Python package, with a custom install command that executes code after installation.",
  "sources": "The custom install command executes 'from main import main' and calls main() during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function imported from 'main' module during install; the content of main() is unknown.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class runs 'install.run(self)' then imports and executes 'main()' from 'main' module.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes code ('main()') after installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious depending on 'main()' contents.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a package with specified metadata. It overrides the 'install' command to run 'main()' from 'main' module post-installation. The 'main()' function's content and behavior are unknown, which is a concern. The rest of the setup process appears normal, with dependencies on 'requests' and 'psutil'. The invocation of arbitrary code during install could be exploited to execute malicious code if 'main()' is malicious or compromised. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are present. The key concern is the execution of external code ('main()') during package installation, which is atypical and potentially dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "The code runs additional code ('main()') upon installation, which could be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful logic. This behavior warrants further review of the 'main' module to assess safety. Overall, the setup is normal aside from the post-install execution step, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
