{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines a package that, during installation, executes an external 'main()' function from 'main', which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "The import 'from main import main' and the subsequent call to 'main()' during the run method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during setup, which could run arbitrary code with install privileges.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the 'run()' method calls 'main()', executing external code outside of standard setup procedures.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external 'main()' during setup, which is atypical and risky; no validation or sandboxing.",
  "analysis": "The code unconditionally executes 'main()' from an external module during installation, which is an unusual pattern that can be exploited if 'main()' contains malicious code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.2-0.3, risk 0.4-0.6) are reasonable given the uncertainty about 'main()' content. The pattern warrants caution, and higher risk scores (around 0.6-0.7) could be justified due to the potential for malicious activity. The absence of obfuscation is consistent across reports. Overall, the main concern is the arbitrary code execution during setup, which should be reviewed by inspecting 'main.py' for malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing external code during installation poses a moderate to high security risk, depending on 'main()' content. The current scores are appropriate but could be slightly increased to reflect the inherent danger of executing untrusted code during package installation. It is recommended to review 'main.py' before trusting this package.",
