  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data to multiple external URLs with randomized query parameters.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (reading system info and network hardware info), random.randint() for generating a random number, base64 encoding of MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() for sending HTTP requests to external URLs with encoded parameters.",
  "flows": "System info and MAC addresses are collected -> MAC addresses are base64 encoded -> URLs with parameters are constructed -> HTTP GET requests are sent to these URLs with system info embedded in query parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code encodes MAC addresses in base64 and sends system info to multiple external domains, some of which are suspicious or non-standard (e.g., oast.cn, oast.fun). The URLs do not appear to be legitimate service endpoints and may be used for tracking or exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers environment details such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses across different operating systems. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then constructs URLs with these details as query parameters. It iterates over a list of potentially malicious or suspicious domains, sending HTTP requests with system data. The use of multiple external domains, obfuscation of data via base64 encoding, and sending of system details without user consent suggest potential malicious intent, such as tracking or data exfiltration. There are no obvious malicious payloads or backdoors, but the behavior resembles C2 or tracking activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects and transmits system and hardware identifiers to external servers, which is suspicious. Although it does not contain direct malicious payloads like data theft or system damage, its activity pattern indicates potential privacy invasion or tracking, possibly used for malicious purposes. The domains used are also suspicious and may be associated with malicious infrastructure.",
