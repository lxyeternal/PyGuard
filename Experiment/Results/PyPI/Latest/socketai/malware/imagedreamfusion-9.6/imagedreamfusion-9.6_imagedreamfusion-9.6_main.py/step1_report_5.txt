{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to remote URLs encoded in Base64 as part of a reporting or tracking function.",
  "sources": "Reading system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), executing system commands (getmac, ifconfig), and generating random numbers.",
  "sinks": "Sending HTTP GET requests with parameters to external URLs via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources is encoded in Base64 (MAC addresses), combined into URL parameters, and transmitted via GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external domains with obfuscated names, no apparent legitimate purpose for data collection, and encoding MAC addresses in Base64 without user consent. The code collects potentially sensitive info and transmits it externally. The URLs are suspicious and possibly malicious. The MAC address collection is performed via system commands that vary by OS, which could be indicative of fingerprinting or tracking.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system information, including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in Base64 and constructs URLs with this data, sending GET requests to external domains. The external domains appear suspicious and possibly malicious, potentially used for tracking or exfiltration. The code does not perform any malicious actions like modifying files or executing harmful commands but collects and transmits system data to external servers, which is often associated with privacy-invasive tracking or reconnaissance behavior. The use of random numbers in URLs may be for cache-bypassing or session identification. No code injection or direct malicious code execution is observed, but the external data collection and transmission are concerning from a privacy and security standpoint.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs system data collection and transmits it to suspicious external servers. It does not execute malicious payloads but could be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or exfiltration of system info. While not overtly malicious, its behavior warrants caution and further investigation due to external communication with suspicious domains.",
