  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data to multiple external URLs for reporting or tracking purposes.",
  "sources": "Platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading MAC addresses, and random.randint() generating a number.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending data over the network to external URLs with embedded system info, potentially for tracking or exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data from system info functions (MAC addresses, hostname, username, directory, random number) is encoded and included as URL parameters in network requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external URLs (with obfuscated or non-standard domains), encoding of MAC addresses in base64, and network requests with no response handling or validation. The code collects sensitive system info and transmits it without user consent or encryption.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers various system identifiers such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes MAC addresses in base64, then constructs URLs with this data as query parameters, sending requests to potentially malicious or suspicious domains. The URLs look suspicious, possibly hosting malicious infrastructure. The code does not perform any validation, error handling is minimal, and it transmits data immediately upon execution. There are no apparent defenses, and the behavior resembles data exfiltration or user tracking. No malicious payloads or backdoors are directly evident, but the pattern of data collection and transmission to suspicious servers is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects sensitive system information and transmits it to external URLs, which appears to be for tracking or potential malicious exfiltration. The use of suspicious domains and lack of user consent or encryption raises security concerns. While no direct malicious payload or backdoor is present, the code's behavior warrants caution and could be part of a malicious supply chain component.",
