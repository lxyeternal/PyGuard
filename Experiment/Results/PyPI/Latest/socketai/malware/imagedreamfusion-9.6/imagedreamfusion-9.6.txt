      "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing external code during installation poses a moderate to high security risk, depending on 'main()' content. The current scores are appropriate but could be slightly increased to reflect the inherent danger of executing untrusted code during package installation. It is recommended to review 'main.py' before trusting this package."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert collection and transmission of system identifiers to suspicious external domains, indicating potentially malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. While it lacks active malicious payloads, its intent and behavior justify high security concern. The current scores are reasonable but could be slightly adjusted to reflect the absence of direct malware payloads, emphasizing the privacy and exfiltration risks."
