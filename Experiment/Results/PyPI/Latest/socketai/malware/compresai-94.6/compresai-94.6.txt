      "conclusion": "The setup script itself is benign but employs a pattern—executing 'main()' during installation—that poses a significant security risk if 'main()' is malicious or compromised. This pattern should be flagged as a supply chain security concern, and further review of the 'main' module is recommended before deployment. The potential for malicious activity is high if 'main()' contains harmful code, leading to a malware score of approximately 0.75 and a security risk score of around 0.75."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior to suspicious external domains, indicating malicious intent. It does not perform destructive actions but poses significant privacy and security risks. The current malware and security risk scores are conservative; they should be increased to approximately 0.8 to accurately reflect the high malicious potential of this script."
