  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to remote URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network interfaces",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending data to remote servers via HTTP GET requests with URL parameters",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are encoded and appended as URL parameters, then sent over HTTP requests to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for MAC addresses, multiple external URLs, no validation or encryption of data, possible data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The code gathers environment information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes MAC addresses in base64, then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to three suspicious domains. The URLs are non-standard and potentially malicious. No user input or untrusted data sources are involved aside from system info. The code does not perform any malicious actions like modifying files or executing commands, but it collects and transmits potentially sensitive data to external servers, which raises privacy and security concerns. The network activity appears to be covert data exfiltration or tracking. The code lacks validation, encryption, or user consent, indicating possible malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system information and transmits it to external URLs without user consent, suggesting potential data exfiltration. Although it does not perform destructive actions, the behavior is suspicious and could be malicious in context.",
