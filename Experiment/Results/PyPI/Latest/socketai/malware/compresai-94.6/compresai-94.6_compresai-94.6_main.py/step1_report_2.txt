  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it via encoded parameters to external URLs.",
  "sources": "Reading system info: platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading network interfaces.",
  "sinks": "Sending HTTP requests via urllib.request.urlopen() to external URLs with query parameters containing system info.",
  "flows": "Collected data (MAC addresses, hostname, username, directory) is encoded in base64, assembled into URL parameters, and transmitted via HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious external URLs, encoding MAC addresses in base64, and sending data without user consent or apparent legitimate purpose. No clear user interaction or benign functionality. No data validation or encryption beyond base64 encoding. Hardcoded URLs are suspicious. No response handling; exceptions are silently ignored.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system identifiers and network information, encodes MAC addresses, and transmits this data to three suspicious external URLs. The URLs appear malicious, likely used for tracking, reconnaissance, or exfiltration. The code does not perform any other apparent malicious activities like system modification or data theft but primarily focuses on information exfiltration. The absence of user interaction and silent exception handling increase suspicion. There are no obfuscation techniques or suspicious code behaviors such as dynamic code execution or credential theft, but the external communication to suspicious domains indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an information stealer, collecting system details and sending them to malicious domains without user consent. The behavior suggests malicious intent primarily aimed at tracking or reconnaissance, with potential for further malicious actions if integrated into larger attack chains.",
