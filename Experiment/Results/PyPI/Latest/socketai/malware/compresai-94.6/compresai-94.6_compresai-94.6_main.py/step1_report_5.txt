  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple remote URLs encoded in base64, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Platform module for system info (platform.node()), getpass for username, os for current working directory, subprocess for MAC addresses, random for generating a number, base64 for encoding MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() for sending data to remote servers via constructed URLs.",
  "flows": "System info sources are used to build URL parameters, which are then sent to remote URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated URLs (with seemingly random subdomains) and sending encoded MAC addresses to third-party domains suggests potential malicious intent. The code does not validate or restrict the destination domains. It collects and transmits user and system data without user consent. The URL domains appear suspicious and potentially malicious, indicating possible command-and-control or data exfiltration behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encoding the MACs in base64. It constructs URLs with these parameters and a random number, then performs HTTP GET requests to external servers. The URLs appear suspicious, and the purpose of collecting and transmitting system information without explicit user consent raises privacy concerns. The code's structure is straightforward, but the choice of domains and data collection indicates potentially malicious behavior aimed at tracking or exfiltration. No malicious code execution, backdoors, or destructive actions are evident, but the data transmission to unknown external servers is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The script secretly gathers system info and transmits it to suspicious external domains, indicating potential privacy violations or malicious data exfiltration. It does not contain malicious payloads like system damage or reverse shells but exhibits suspicious behavior suitable for malicious tracking or reconnaissance. Overall risk is moderate, primarily due to the suspicious URLs and data collection.",
