  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses) and send it to multiple remote URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), MAC addresses (via platform-specific commands), random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests with encoded system info to remote URLs via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Collects system info -> encodes MAC addresses -> constructs URLs with parameters -> sends data via HTTP GET requests to multiple remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs with suspicious domain names; encoding MAC addresses in base64 which could be used for fingerprinting; no user interaction or explicit consent; no response handling or validation; use of random number in URL path may be to track or correlate requests. No clear purpose besides information gathering and transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and sends these details via HTTP GET requests to three external domains that appear suspicious or malicious. The URLs are non-standard, potentially malicious servers. The data transmission is automated without user consent, and the use of encoding may be to obfuscate data. No malicious code like backdoors or destructive commands is present, but the behavior resembles data exfiltration or fingerprinting typical of malware. No evident security vulnerabilities or obfuscation techniques are employed beyond simple encoding. The code does not perform any malicious actions like damaging files or system components but is suspicious due to its behavior and external communication to dubious domains.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to collect and transmit system identifiers to external servers without user consent, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It resembles a data exfiltration or fingerprinting tool. No active malicious actions like backdoors or destructive commands are present, but the behavior is concerning in a security context.",
