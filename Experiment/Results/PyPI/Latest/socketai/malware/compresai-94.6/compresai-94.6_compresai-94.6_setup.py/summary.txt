  "conclusion": "The setup script itself is benign but employs a pattern—executing 'main()' during installation—that poses a significant security risk if 'main()' is malicious or compromised. This pattern should be flagged as a supply chain security concern, and further review of the 'main' module is recommended before deployment. The potential for malicious activity is high if 'main()' contains harmful code, leading to a malware score of approximately 0.75 and a security risk score of around 0.75."
