{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines a custom installation process that, after completing the standard installation, imports and executes the 'main' function from the 'main' module, potentially executing arbitrary code during package installation.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from main import main' and the subsequent call to 'main()' in the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The execution of 'main()' during the install process, which could run malicious code if 'main()' contains harmful instructions.",
  "flows": "The flow begins with the installation process invoking 'install.run(self)', then proceeds to import 'main' from the 'main' module, and finally executes 'main()', which could perform arbitrary actions.",
  "anomalies": "Executing external code ('main()') during package installation is unusual and potentially malicious, especially if 'main()' is untrusted or contains harmful code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during its run, performs the standard installation steps and then imports and executes 'main()' from a local module. No obfuscation or suspicious dependencies are present. The primary concern is that executing 'main()' during setup can be exploited if 'main()' contains malicious code, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or other harmful actions. The pattern of executing code during install is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The risk level depends on the trustworthiness of the 'main' module; if untrusted, this pattern could lead to malicious behavior. The code itself is straightforward, but the execution of external code during setup warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script itself is benign but employs a pattern—executing 'main()' during installation—that poses a significant security risk if 'main()' is malicious or compromised. This pattern should be flagged as a supply chain security concern, and further review of the 'main' module is recommended before deployment. The potential for malicious activity is high if 'main()' contains harmful code, leading to a malware score of approximately 0.75 and a security risk score of around 0.75.",
