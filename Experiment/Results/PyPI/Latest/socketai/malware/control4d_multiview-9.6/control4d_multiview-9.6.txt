      "conclusion": "The setup script exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious backdoors or unwanted code execution. The pattern of executing external code during installation without safeguards poses a significant security risk. The current reports' scores are appropriate, but a slight increase in malware and risk scores to around 0.8 is recommended to reflect the potential severity."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert collection and transmission of system information to external servers, indicating malicious or at least highly suspicious activity related to data exfiltration. While it does not contain active malware payloads, its behavior is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious, justifying high security and malware concern scores."
