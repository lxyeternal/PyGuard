  "conclusion": "The setup script exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious backdoors or unwanted code execution. The pattern of executing external code during installation without safeguards poses a significant security risk. The current reports' scores are appropriate, but a slight increase in malware and risk scores to around 0.8 is recommended to reflect the potential severity."
