  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration and execute a custom installation routine that calls the main function from an imported module.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method in the CrazyInstallStrat class, specifically the import of 'main' from 'main' module.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' during installation, which could execute arbitrary code from the 'main' module.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method executes, importing and calling 'main()', which may run arbitrary code depending on its implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The 'run' method calls an external 'main' function unconditionally during install, which is unusual and potentially malicious if 'main' contains harmful code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script extends the default install command with CrazyInstallStrat, which, after executing the standard install, imports and executes 'main()' from a local module. This behavior can lead to executing arbitrary code during package installation, a common tactic for malicious or undesired actions. There are no other suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code runs an external 'main()' function during installation, which could execute arbitrary or malicious code depending on its implementation. While this might be legitimate in some contexts, it raises security concerns as it executes code outside the standard installation process. The overall risk is moderate, warranting review of the 'main' module.",
