  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes a main function during installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, execution of 'main' function from 'main' module during the 'run' method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main' function imported from 'main' module, which may contain further malicious code.",
  "flows": "The install process triggers the 'run' method of 'CrazyInstallStrat', which calls 'main()' from 'main' module after installation.",
  "anomalies": "Custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' executes code ('main()') post-installation, which is unusual and could be used to run malicious code after setup.",
  "analysis": "The setup script overrides the default install command with 'CrazyInstallStrat', which calls the original install process and then immediately executes 'main()' from an external 'main' module. This post-install execution is unconventional and can be exploited to run malicious code, such as backdoors or malware, if 'main' contains malicious logic. The code does not perform any input validation or checks before executing 'main', making it potentially dangerous. The dependencies ('requests', 'psutil') are common but can also be exploited if their use is malicious within 'main'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not inherently malicious but employs an unconventional and potentially dangerous practice by executing external code ('main') immediately after installation. This behavior could be leveraged for malicious purposes if 'main' is malicious. The setup process itself appears normal but the post-install code execution warrants caution.",
