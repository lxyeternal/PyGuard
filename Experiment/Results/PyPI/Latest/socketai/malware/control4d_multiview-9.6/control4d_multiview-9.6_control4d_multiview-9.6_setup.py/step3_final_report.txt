  "purpose": "Detects and warns about executing external code during package installation, which could be malicious.",
  "sources": "Importing 'main' from 'main' module and calling 'main()' after setup.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function, potentially running arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Post-installation, code flow from import to execution of 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external module 'main' during setup without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code unconditionally executes 'main()' after installation, which is unconventional and risky. This pattern can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as backdoors or executing harmful code. The scores assigned in reports vary based on confidence, but given the pattern, a high malware score (~0.8) and high security risk (~0.8) are justified. No obfuscation is present. The behavior warrants caution and further inspection of 'main.py'.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious backdoors or unwanted code execution. The pattern of executing external code during installation without safeguards poses a significant security risk. The current reports' scores are appropriate, but a slight increase in malware and risk scores to around 0.8 is recommended to reflect the potential severity.",
