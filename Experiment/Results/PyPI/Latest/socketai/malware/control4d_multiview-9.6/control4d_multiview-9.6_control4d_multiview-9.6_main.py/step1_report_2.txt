  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "Reading system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), retrieving MAC addresses via subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests to external URLs with query parameters containing encoded system data.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) is gathered, encoded, then sent via URL requests to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to invoke system commands for MAC addresses; URLs are suspicious and obscure, likely used for data exfiltration. Encoding MAC addresses in base64 before transmission.",
  "analysis": "The script collects potentially sensitive system info, including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which could obscure data but is not inherently malicious. It then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to external domains. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely used for covert data exfiltration. The code does not perform any destructive actions but could be used maliciously for tracking or data theft without user consent. No hardcoded credentials are present, and the network activity is straightforward, though privacy-invasive.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily used for gathering and transmitting system information to suspicious external servers. It does not contain obvious malware but exhibits malicious privacy-intrusive behavior. The URLs and data collection suggest potential malicious intent or at least malicious intent in an intelligence context.",
