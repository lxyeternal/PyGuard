{
  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple remote URLs encoded in Base64.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), MAC addresses (via subprocess calls), and system data from get_mac_addresses().",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests sent to external URLs with encoded system data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System data (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) is collected, encoded, and then transmitted via GET requests to remote servers specified in the URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obscure URLs with '.cn', '.fun', and 'oast' domains that may indicate C2 or malicious data exfiltration. Sends system info without user consent or obvious necessity. No explicit user prompts or permissions are requested.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers detailed system info including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current working directory. It encodes MAC addresses in Base64 and transmits this data to multiple external domains via HTTP GET requests, potentially for tracking or reconnaissance. The URLs appear suspicious and possibly malicious. The code does not perform any malicious actions like modifying files or executing arbitrary code, but it does exfiltrate system information silently. The use of multiple external domains and obfuscated URL patterns suggests malicious intent or at least malicious behavior, such as fingerprinting or surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects and transmits system information to remote servers without user consent, which is suspicious and could be malicious. It appears designed for covert data collection or tracking, raising security concerns. Although it does not execute destructive actions, its behavior warrants caution and likely indicates malicious or at least malicious-intent activity.",
