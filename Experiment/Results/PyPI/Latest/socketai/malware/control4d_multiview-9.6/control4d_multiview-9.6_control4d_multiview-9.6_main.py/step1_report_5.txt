  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node() for hostname; getpass.getuser() for username; os.getcwd() for current directory; get_mac_addresses() function for MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() for sending data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) collected from sources -> URL parameters constructed -> data sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded external URLs pointing to suspicious or potentially malicious domains; MAC addresses are base64-encoded and sent externally; no validation or consent prompts before data transmission; usage of random numbers for URL uniqueness; minimal error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system data including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and appends all collected data as URL parameters to three different URLs. The URLs are non-standard and suspicious, likely used for data exfiltration. No user consent, encryption, or anonymization beyond base64 encoding is present. The code performs network communication without validation, which could be malicious or unwanted behavior. No signs of backdoors or malicious payloads beyond data transmission are evident. The code appears designed to silently harvest system info and send it to external servers.",
  "conclusion": "The script is collecting and transmitting system identification data to suspicious external servers without user consent, indicative of potential data exfiltration or malicious tracking activity. The use of obfuscated URL domains and encoding suggests malicious intent or at least malicious use. The overall security risk is high, and this code should be considered potentially malicious.",
