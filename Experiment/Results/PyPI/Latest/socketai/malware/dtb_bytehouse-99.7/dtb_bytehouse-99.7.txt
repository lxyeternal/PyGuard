      "conclusion": "Executing main() during setup is a security concern that could lead to malicious activity if main.py is harmful. Without evidence of malicious content, the malware risk is moderate. The behavior is suspicious and warrants caution, but not definitive maliciousness based solely on this code."

      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior, primarily for covert data collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains. It lacks user consent, encryption, and obfuscation, increasing security risks. The activity aligns with malware or tracking scripts, warranting high malware and security risk scores."
