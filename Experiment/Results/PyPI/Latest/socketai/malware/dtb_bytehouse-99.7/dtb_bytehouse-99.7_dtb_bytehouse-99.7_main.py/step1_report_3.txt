  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to external URLs, possibly for tracking or reconnaissance purposes.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd() - gathering hostname, username, current directory; URLs hardcoded in the list.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() - sending data to external servers; logging responses.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (hostname, username, current_path) are encoded into URLs and transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs that appear suspicious; sending system info without user consent; no authentication or encryption; response is logged, potentially capturing server responses.",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, and current directory. It generates a random number for each request and constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains, potentially for data exfiltration or tracking. The URLs seem malicious or at least suspicious given their domain names. It sends HTTP GET requests with system info parameters to these URLs, possibly without user awareness. The code does not sanitize or verify the data sent. No malicious code execution or data theft is directly evident beyond the potential for privacy invasion. The code could be used for fingerprinting or malicious monitoring. The URLs and data transmission are concerning, indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system info and transmits it to external, suspicious domains, likely for tracking or reconnaissance. No clear malicious payloads like reverse shells or destructive actions are present, but its behavior is suspicious and privacy-invasive. It poses a security concern due to undisclosed data transmission to untrusted servers.",
