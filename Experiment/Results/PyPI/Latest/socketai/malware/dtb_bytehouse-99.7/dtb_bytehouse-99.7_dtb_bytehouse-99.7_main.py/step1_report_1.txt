  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to multiple remote URLs, likely for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to external URLs",
  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current directory, random number) -> URL construction -> data transmission via HTTP GET request",
  "anomalies": "Sends collected system info to suspicious external domains; uses multiple URLs that appear malicious; no user consent or notification; minimal error handling that logs errors rather than protecting or encrypting data.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, current working directory, and a random number. It constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and transmits this data via HTTP GET requests. The domains appear malicious or related to command-and-control servers, indicating possible data exfiltration or tracking. No user interaction or consent is evident. No obfuscation or code complexity is present, but the behavior suggests malicious intent. The use of standard libraries for network communication is typical, but the purpose and destination indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to silently collect system info and send it to potentially malicious external servers, indicating malicious behavior intended for data exfiltration or surveillance. It does not contain obfuscation but exhibits suspicious behavior due to its external communication with suspicious domains.",
