  "purpose": "Collects system information (hostname, username, current directory) and sends it to multiple remote URLs as part of a URL with query parameters.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url) where data is sent to remote servers",
  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current directory) -> URL construction -> HTTP GET request to remote servers",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple suspicious URLs that appear to be obfuscated or malicious domains; sends system info without user consent; no user input validation; makes network requests to external domains which may be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system-specific information such as hostname, username, and current directory, then constructs URLs pointing to potentially malicious or suspicious domains. It sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs. The domains used are obscure and may be associated with malicious activities such as data exfiltration or tracking. The use of random numbers in URL parameters could be to bypass caching or for tracking. There are no safeguards or user prompts, and no indication of legitimate use. The code could be part of a malicious data collection or exfiltration operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform system data collection and transmits it to external servers without user consent, using suspicious domains. This behavior indicates potential malicious activity such as data exfiltration or tracking. The overall design and domain choices raise significant security concerns.",
