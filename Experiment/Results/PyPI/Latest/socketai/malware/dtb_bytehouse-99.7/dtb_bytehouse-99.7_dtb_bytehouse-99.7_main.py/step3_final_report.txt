  ],
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, current working directory, and generates a random number, then constructs URLs with these parameters. It sends HTTP GET requests to each URL, transmitting system info in cleartext. The domains used are suspicious and likely malicious. The behavior aligns with data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present, but the silent data transmission to suspicious domains indicates malicious intent. The code's activity is passive but potentially harmful, with high privacy and security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior, primarily for covert data collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains. It lacks user consent, encryption, and obfuscation, increasing security risks. The activity aligns with malware or tracking scripts, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
