  "purpose": "The code executes the main() function from main.py during package installation, which could run arbitrary code.",

  "sinks": "Execution of main() during setup, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if main.py contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method calls main(), executing code from main.py.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external code during package setup; no obfuscation or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that, after performing standard installation, imports and executes main() from main.py. This introduces a sink point where arbitrary code can run during installation. No obfuscation or secrets are present. The behavior is suspicious because executing code during setup can be exploited if main.py is malicious. The scores across reports vary, with malware scores from 0.25 to 0.6 and security risks from 0.5 to 0.75, reflecting cautious concern but no definitive malicious evidence. Given the pattern, the primary risk is the potential for malicious code execution during install, which warrants a high security risk score but a conservative malware score unless main.py is confirmed malicious.",
  "conclusion": "Executing main() during setup is a security concern that could lead to malicious activity if main.py is harmful. Without evidence of malicious content, the malware risk is moderate. The behavior is suspicious and warrants caution, but not definitive maliciousness based solely on this code.",
