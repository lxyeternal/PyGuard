  "purpose": "Connects to a Minecraft server via RCON and assigns operator privileges to a specified user.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'op {username}' command via RCON, logging outputs",
  "flows": "Input parameters → assign_operator function → mcr.command('op {username}')",
  "anomalies": "Logging sensitive data such as server IP, port, and password; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that uses the mcrcon library to connect to a Minecraft server and execute an 'op' command for a given username. It accepts credentials and server details via command-line arguments, logs connection and errors, and handles exceptions properly. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. The logging of server info and credentials could pose security concerns if logs are exposed, but this is a standard practice and not malicious. The script performs a legitimate server administration task without obfuscation or backdoors. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.2) are consistent with its behavior and context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, low-risk administrative script for managing Minecraft server operator privileges. It does not contain malicious behavior or significant security flaws. The low security risk score of 0.2 appropriately reflects the handling of sensitive credentials and logging practices. No modifications are necessary unless enhancing credential security or log management.",
