  "purpose": "The code is designed to connect to a Minecraft server via RCON protocol and assign operator privileges to a specified user.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for username, server IP, RCON port, and RCON password.",
  "sinks": "Uses the RCON command to execute 'op {username}', which grants operator privileges on the server.",
  "flows": "Input data (username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password) flows from command-line arguments to the assign_operator function, which then sends an 'op' command via RCON to the server.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; logging and exception handling are standard. No suspicious or malicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The script takes user input for server details and username, then uses a legitimate library (mcrcon) to send a command to the Minecraft server to grant operator status. All data flows are straightforward and intended for legitimate server management. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The use of logging for connection and error reporting appears standard. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward administrative tool for managing Minecraft server operator privileges. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this module. It performs a common task securely if used properly.",
