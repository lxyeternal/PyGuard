{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script configures the packaging of the 'pojang_resorter' Python project, specifying dependencies, entry points, and package data.",
  "sources": "The code reads dependency list 'install_requires', package data 'libs/windows.exe', and entry point 'pojang-resorter'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could flow from dependencies or included executable, but none are actively used or executed here.",
  "flows": "Dependencies are listed in 'install_requires'; 'libs/windows.exe' is included in package data; no runtime data flow occurs in this script.",
  "anomalies": "Missing comma after 'mcron' in 'install_requires' causes a syntax error; inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe' is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration with a syntax error (missing comma) that could prevent proper installation. No malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The inclusion of an executable file warrants further inspection outside this script. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are appropriate given the evidence, with the main concern being the executable's nature. Correcting the syntax error is recommended, and further review of the executable is advised for security.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with a minor syntax mistake. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation is found. The main issue is the missing comma, which should be fixed. The inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe' is suspicious but not malicious based solely on this code. Overall, the code is safe, with a very low security risk.",
