  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with a minor syntax mistake. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation is found. The main issue is the missing comma, which should be fixed. The inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe' is suspicious but not malicious based solely on this code. Overall, the code is safe, with a very low security risk."
