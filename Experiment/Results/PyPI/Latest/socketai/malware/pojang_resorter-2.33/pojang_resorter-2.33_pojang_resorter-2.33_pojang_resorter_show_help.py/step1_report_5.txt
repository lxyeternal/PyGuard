{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface with help and subcommands for a Python-based Mojang interaction tool.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data output or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "User input via command-line arguments is processed to display help messages and ASCII art; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Uses ASCII art with color formatting, which appears purely cosmetic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a function to show help with ASCII art and command descriptions, and parses command-line arguments to provide help information. No user input is processed beyond displaying help, no data is sent over network, and no sensitive operations occur. The code structure is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated code or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a CLI help display with colored ASCII art and command descriptions. There is no malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risk evident. It appears to be a benign utility script.",
