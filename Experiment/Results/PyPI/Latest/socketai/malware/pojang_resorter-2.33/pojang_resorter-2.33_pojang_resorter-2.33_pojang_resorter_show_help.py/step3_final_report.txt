  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments to help display; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI help utility that displays ASCII art and command descriptions with color styling. It does not process untrusted input beyond argument parsing, nor does it perform network, file, or dynamic code operations. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The ASCII art and styling are static and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, decorative CLI help utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its harmlessness.",
