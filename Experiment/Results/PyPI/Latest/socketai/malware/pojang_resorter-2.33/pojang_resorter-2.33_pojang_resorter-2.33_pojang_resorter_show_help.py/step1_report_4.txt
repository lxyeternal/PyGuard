{
  "purpose": "Provides a CLI tool with help and command display functionality, mainly for user interaction and command guidance.",
  "sources": "Input is read via argparse from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; no data leaks or unsafe data handling observed.",
  "flows": "User inputs are parsed by argparse and used to determine command behavior, with no further data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. Usage of ASCII art and colored output appears purely for aesthetic purposes. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a command-line interface with ASCII art and colored headers using colorama. It defines multiple subcommands for user operations. All input handling is via argparse, with no external data sources, network activity, or sensitive data handling observed. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices without any malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign CLI help display tool with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs user interface functions without external communication or security-sensitive operations.",
