{
  "purpose": "Provide a CLI tool that displays help information with ASCII art and colored command descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input is primarily from command-line arguments parsed via argparse.",
  "sinks": "Output to the console with print statements; no untrusted data output or external system calls detected.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line arguments) -> argparse parsing -> display ASCII art and help info on the console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Use of colorama appears benign, solely for display purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a function to show help with ASCII art and colored headers, and sets up argument parsing for subcommands. It then displays the ASCII art and command options when executed. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious behaviors are observed. The subcommands are purely informational and do not perform any harmful actions.\nOverall, the script functions as a decorative CLI help utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help display script that uses colorama for visual effects. It does not contain malware, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. No security risks are present.",
