{
  "purpose": "This script acts as a command-line interface to execute various server management scripts and functions, including initializing, previewing, displaying help, assigning operators, and nuking the server.",
  "sources": "The script reads command-line arguments (via argparse), local script files (.py files in the same directory), and imports functions from other modules (pojang_resorter.forceop and pojang_resorter.nukeserver).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include subprocess.run executing other Python scripts, and dynamic imports of functions that could potentially be used maliciously if the modules are compromised.",
  "flows": "User provides a command and optional arguments -> script validates command -> if command matches, it either runs a local script via subprocess or calls an imported function -> errors or logs are recorded as needed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code dynamically executes other scripts based on command-line input without sanitization, which could lead to unintended script execution if the command map is manipulated or if the script files are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code allows execution of other Python scripts or functions based on user input, which inherently could be risky if the scripts themselves are malicious or compromised. The command mapping is static and limited, reducing the risk of arbitrary command execution. The import statements are specific and not dynamic, which mitigates some risk. The subprocess call executes scripts in the same directory, which could be malicious if the scripts are altered. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present. The script’s main risk is in its ability to execute external scripts or functions based on user input, which requires trust in the local environment and scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script itself appears to be a legitimate CLI tool for server management, with controlled command execution. The main security concern is its reliance on the local scripts and modules it imports or executes, which could be malicious if compromised. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or malware embedded within this code. Overall, the code is not malicious but depends on trusted local scripts.",
