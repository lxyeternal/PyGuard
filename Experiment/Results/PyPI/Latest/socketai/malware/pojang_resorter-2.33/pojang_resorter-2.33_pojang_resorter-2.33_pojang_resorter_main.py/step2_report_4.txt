  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall risk, then compare their assessments with the code and my reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Acts as a CLI dispatcher for server management scripts/functions.\n- Uses a fixed command map to invoke local scripts or imported functions.\n- Executes scripts via subprocess in the same directory.\n- Imports specific functions from modules (pojang_resorter.forceop and pojang_resorter.nukeserver).\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- Risks stem from executing local scripts and imported modules, which could be malicious if compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Legitimate CLI for server management.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.3\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Analysis aligns with the code: no malicious behavior, relies on local scripts, which could be malicious if compromised.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar, controlled command execution.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.4\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Highlights that imported modules/functions could be malicious if compromised.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No signs of malicious code, but dependency trust is critical.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Standard CLI wrapper.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Emphasizes that the code is benign, with execution depending on trusted scripts/modules.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Command dispatcher.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.85\n- Notes that execution depends on the trustworthiness of modules/scripts.\n- **Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar command wrapper.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- No malicious activity detected; the design is controlled.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency and Critical Analysis:\n\n- All reports agree that the script itself is benign and acts as a controlled dispatcher.\n- The primary risk is reliance on local scripts and modules, which could be malicious if compromised.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which I concur with.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** Given the reliance on external scripts/modules that could be malicious, but the code itself is safe, I would assign a **risk score of around 0.2**. This reflects some caution but no immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Justification                                                      |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0 — No malicious code, payloads, or suspicious behavior detected.        |\n| Obfuscated     | 0 — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                     |\n| Risk           | 0.2 — Moderate, depends on trustworthiness of local scripts/modules.    |\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate server management CLI tool with minimal inherent risk, contingent on the security of the local scripts and modules it invokes.**",
