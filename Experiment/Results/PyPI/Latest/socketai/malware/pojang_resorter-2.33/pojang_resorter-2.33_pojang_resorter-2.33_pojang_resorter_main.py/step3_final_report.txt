  "purpose": "A CLI dispatcher for executing server management scripts and functions based on user input, with controlled command options.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, local script files, imported modules/functions.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing scripts, imported functions from modules.",
  "flows": "User input → command parsing → command validation → execution via subprocess or imported functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity; reliance on external scripts/modules which could be malicious if compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that executes predefined scripts or functions based on limited, whitelisted commands. It imports specific functions from trusted modules and runs scripts via subprocess in the same directory. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of external scripts and modules ('pojang_resorter.forceop', 'pojang_resorter.nukeserver', and the scripts invoked via subprocess). The code's structure minimizes the attack surface by restricting commands and controlling execution flow. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as no malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The security risk score is moderate (around 0.2), reflecting reliance on external dependencies that could be compromised, but the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, controlled CLI utility for server management with no inherent malicious activity. The primary security concern is ensuring the integrity of external scripts and modules it depends on. Scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2.",
