  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal package initialization module, importing a main function and setting package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and only imports a local function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module with a docstring, an import statement from a local module, and static metadata variables. It does not handle external data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. All reports correctly identify its benign and minimal nature, assigning scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization module with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
