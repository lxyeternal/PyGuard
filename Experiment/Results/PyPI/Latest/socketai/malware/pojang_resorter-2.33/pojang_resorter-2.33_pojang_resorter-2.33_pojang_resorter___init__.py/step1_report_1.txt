{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool by importing the main function and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports 'main' from a local module; defines __version__ and __author__ as string literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets metadata and imports a function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a docstring, an import statement, and package metadata variables. No external data input, network communication, or sensitive data handling observed. The import is from a local module, which is standard for Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package initialization file, setting metadata and importing core functionality. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
