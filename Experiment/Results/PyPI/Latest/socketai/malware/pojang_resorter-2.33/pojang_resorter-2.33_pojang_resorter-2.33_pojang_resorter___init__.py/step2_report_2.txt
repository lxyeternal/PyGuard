  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior**  \nAll reports agree that the code is minimal, static, and only involves importing a local `main` function and defining package metadata (`__version__` and `__author__`). There are no signs of external data input, network communication, or any malicious constructs. The code is a typical package entry point or initialization file.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \nThe reports are consistent in identifying that the code is straightforward and benign. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident. The code's simplicity reduces the likelihood of hidden issues.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, as no obfuscation is present.  \n- **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, no malicious activity or code is detected.  \n- **Security Risk Score (0)**: Correct, the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent, focusing only on the code's static analysis. This is appropriate given the code snippet.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores**  \nThe scores assigned (obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis and the code content.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**  \nGiven the code's simplicity, there is no reason to adjust the scores upward. The reports are thorough and align with standard static analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, minimal package module with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The reports are consistent and correct in their assessments. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
