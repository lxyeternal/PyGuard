  "sources": "No input or data reading; static code with no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or external calls.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code only defines imports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Lacks any suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, importing a main function and defining version and author metadata. There are no suspicious behaviors, external network interactions, or sensitive data handling observed. The code appears to be a typical package module initialization file, serving as a wrapper or entry point for the CLI tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign package setup file with no harmful or suspicious features.",
