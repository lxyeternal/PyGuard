  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, consisting of a docstring, an import statement, and static metadata variables.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, external network activity, or data handling.\n   - The import is from a local module, which is standard practice for package entry points.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or overlooked issues are apparent given the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a security risk of 0, and there's no evidence of malicious activity, this is justified.\n   - The code does not perform any external communication, data processing, or contain suspicious patterns.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code is purely static and lacks any malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made; the reports are purely descriptive.\n   - They correctly avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's observable behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (Code is straightforward, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (No security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the code snippet and the detailed reports, the overall security posture appears benign. The code is standard for a package's entry point, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Therefore, my final estimates are:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the evidence provided.",
