{
  "purpose": "Provides the main entry point and version information for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'main' function from a local module, defines version and author metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is primarily declarative and import-based.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package metadata and entry point declaration. It imports a function from a local module without executing any potentially risky code. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The version and author strings are static and standard for package setup files. No input handling or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and appears to serve as a standard package module with metadata and an import statement. It poses no security risks.",
