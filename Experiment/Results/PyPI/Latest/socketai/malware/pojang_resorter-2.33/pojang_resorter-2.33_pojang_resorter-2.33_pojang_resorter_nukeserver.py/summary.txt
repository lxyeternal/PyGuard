  "conclusion": "The code itself is not malicious but acts as a conduit for executing an external binary, which could be malicious if compromised. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of 'libs/windows.exe'. The malware score should be near zero, and the security risk should be moderate (~0.3). The use of subprocess.run() without validation is a potential vector for malicious activity if the external executable is malicious. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or embedded malicious logic."
