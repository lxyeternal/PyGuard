{
  "purpose": "The code fetches a remote file, saves it as ~/.fleetwood.py, and appends a command to shell configuration files to execute this script, enabling persistent remote code execution.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen to fetch remote data; open() to write to ~/.fleetwood.py; open() to append to ~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'python ~/.fleetwood.py' via shell configs; potential for remote code execution and persistence",
  "flows": "Fetch remote data -> write to ~/.fleetwood.py -> append command to shell configs -> on shell startup, execute remote code",
  "anomalies": "Silent broad exception handling suppresses errors; no validation of fetched content; modification of user environment files without user consent",
  "analysis": "The script downloads code from a hardcoded URL without validation, writes it to a hidden file, and modifies user shell configuration files to execute this code on startup. Exception handling is broad and silent, hiding potential errors. This pattern facilitates persistent remote code execution, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but its behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during installation, modifying user environment files for persistence, and suppressing errors to hide failures. The behavior aligns with typical malware or backdoor tactics. Given the high potential for malicious activity, the malware score is set to 0.9, and the security risk score is also 0.9. The code is not obfuscated, so the obfuscation score is 0. Overall, this package should be considered highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
