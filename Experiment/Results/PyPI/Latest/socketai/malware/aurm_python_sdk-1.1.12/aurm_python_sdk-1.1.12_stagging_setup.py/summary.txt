  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during installation, modifying user environment files for persistence, and suppressing errors to hide failures. The behavior aligns with typical malware or backdoor tactics. Given the high potential for malicious activity, the malware score is set to 0.9, and the security risk score is also 0.9. The code is not obfuscated, so the obfuscation score is 0. Overall, this package should be considered highly suspicious and potentially malicious."
