  "purpose": "Initialize the package namespace for tests by importing 'test_function' from module1.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .module1 import test_function",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; import simply includes a function in the module namespace",
  "anomalies": "Standard package initialization; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function from a sibling module and exposes it via __all__, which is typical for package setup files. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. No external data sources, network activity, or environment variable usage are present. It is a straightforward module initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package __init__.py file used for organizing imports. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
