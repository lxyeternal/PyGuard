  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**1. Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is a straightforward import of `test_function` from `module1`, with no dynamic behavior, secrets, or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is indeed a simple import statement, with no signs of malicious activity. The reasoning is sound. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**2. Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing no anomalies, secrets, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSame as above, the code is benign. The reasoning and scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**3. Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes a typical package initializer importing `test_function`, with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is straightforward. The report's reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**4. Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard import and `__all__` definition, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code and previous analyses.\n\n---\n\n**5. Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard package initialization.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, standard package initializer with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent, thorough, and accurate.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1. These are reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports suggest any risk that warrants a higher score. The code is standard, with no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Malware score?**  \n  Correctly set to 0 in all reports.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n- **Consistency of scores?**  \n  Yes, consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard Python package initialization script. No dynamic code, no external data, no suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action needed.",
