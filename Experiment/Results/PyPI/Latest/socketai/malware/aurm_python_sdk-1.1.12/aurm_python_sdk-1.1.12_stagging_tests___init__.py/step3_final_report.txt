  "purpose": "Package initialization script that imports 'test_function' from '.module1' and exposes it via '__all__'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'test_function' from '.module1'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'test_function' flows directly into module namespace; no external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal '__init__.py' file that imports a function from a local module and exposes it. It contains no dynamic code, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initializer with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
