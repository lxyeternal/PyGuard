  "purpose": "Initialize the test package by importing test_function from module1 for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .module1 import test_function",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this code; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "Import statement loads test_function from module1; no data flow beyond module loading",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple import and export statement, no secrets, code execution, or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python package initialization file that imports a function from a sibling module and defines __all__ for export. It contains no dynamic code, no untrusted input, and no suspicious behavior. It does not perform any actions beyond re-exporting a function, and the structure is standard for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a package initializer, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
