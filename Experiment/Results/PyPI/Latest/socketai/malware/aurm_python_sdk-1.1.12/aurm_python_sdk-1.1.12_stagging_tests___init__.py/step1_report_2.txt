  "purpose": "Initialization file for tests package, importing test_function from module1 for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'test_function' from the local module 'module1'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or unsafe operations present.",
  "flows": "Import statement imports 'test_function', making it available in the namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard package initialization pattern, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package initializer that imports a specific function from a local module and exposes it via __all__. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors that could indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, no network activity, no credential handling, and no unusual constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign package initialization file with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
