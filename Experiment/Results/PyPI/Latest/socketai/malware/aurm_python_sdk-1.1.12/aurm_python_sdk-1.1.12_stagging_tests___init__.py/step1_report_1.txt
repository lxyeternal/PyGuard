  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing test_function from module1 for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .module1 import test_function",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "Import statement flows into __all__ assignment, but no data flows from external sources at runtime",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package initialization",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function from a local module and exposes it via __all__. There are no dynamic executions, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behaviors. The code is minimal and standard for Python package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initialization file with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
