  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static greeting string, used for testing or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "The function does not read external input or data; it contains a static return statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the function only returns a fixed string.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the function executes a static return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and clear.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static function with no inputs, outputs, or side effects. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The high confidence score (1) reflects certainty in the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static test function with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware likelihood is effectively zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
