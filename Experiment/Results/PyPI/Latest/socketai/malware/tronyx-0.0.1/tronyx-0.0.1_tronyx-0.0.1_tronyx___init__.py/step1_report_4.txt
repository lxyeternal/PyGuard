{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function or variable named 'perm' from a module named 'main' within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'main'. No external input or data sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data outputs, network connections, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow observed; import statement alone does not facilitate data flow or malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'perm' from a local module 'main'. This is a standard import statement, typical in Python projects. There is no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. No external inputs, environment variables, or sensitive data are accessed or manipulated. The code's simplicity indicates a benign purpose, assuming the 'main' module and 'perm' are legitimate components of the project.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a Python package, with no indications of sabotage, malware, or security concerns.",
