  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the 'main' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement, specifically the relative import from .main",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified in this snippet, as it only contains an import statement",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths, as this is a single import statement",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; import statement is straightforward and common in modular Python code",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import of 'perm' from the local 'main' module. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The import alone does not indicate malicious intent, as it is a common practice for modular code organization. Without additional context or code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple relative import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is a typical part of Python package structure and does not raise concerns on its own.",
