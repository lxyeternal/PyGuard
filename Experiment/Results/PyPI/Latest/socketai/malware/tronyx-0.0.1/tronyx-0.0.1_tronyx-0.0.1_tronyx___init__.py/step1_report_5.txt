{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function or variable named 'perm' from a module named 'main' within the same package, likely for internal use or functionality extension.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.main' module",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data outputs or external calls are shown",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident in this single import statement",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, which is standard practice for modular code organization. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leaks, or code injection. Since the code is minimal, it doesn't provide any pathways for untrusted data or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, simply importing a component from a local module without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
