  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only performing a standard import; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'perm' from a local module 'main'. This is a typical import statement with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent. Without additional context or code that uses 'perm', there are no apparent security concerns or malicious behaviors. The snippet alone is benign.",
