{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function or variable named 'perm' from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement accesses the 'main' module; no external data input is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs in this snippet; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are evident in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, with no indications of obfuscation, hidden behavior, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply performs a relative import of 'perm' from the 'main' module. It does not include any execution, data handling, or network activity. Due to its minimal nature, there are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security issues. The code appears to be a typical import statement used in Python packages or modules.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified. The code is benign and typical for Python modules.",
