{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of 'perm' from the 'main' module within the same package, likely for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement itself; no external data or input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present; the import simply makes 'perm' available in the current module.",
  "flows": "The import statement loads 'perm' from '.main' into the current namespace; no data flows or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is a straightforward import.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python relative import statement. It does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies. The import is typical for modular Python packages. Given the simplicity, there are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, risk score near 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, standard import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores reflect that. No further action or scrutiny is necessary based solely on this snippet.",
