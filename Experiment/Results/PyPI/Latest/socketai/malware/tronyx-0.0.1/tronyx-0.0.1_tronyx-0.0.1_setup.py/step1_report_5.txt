  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'tronyx' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; setup parameters are static strings and list items.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Use of standard setup pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package. It reads a local README file for the long description and specifies package metadata. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. All inputs are static or file reads with no external untrusted input. The only external link is a GitHub repository URL, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
