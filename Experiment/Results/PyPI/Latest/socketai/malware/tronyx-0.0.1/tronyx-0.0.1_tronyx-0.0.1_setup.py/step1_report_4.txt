  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description, defining package dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reading file content into long_description, then passing data into setup() parameters. No external data flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks using setuptools. It reads a README file for the long description and specifies dependencies and project URLs. All operations are typical for a setup.py file. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
