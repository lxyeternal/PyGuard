  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high security risk due to private key exfiltration over insecure channels, with signs of poor coding or obfuscation. While no active malware payload is delivered, the behavior is malicious in the context of supply chain security. The scores should reflect high malware (around 0.75-0.8) and security risk (~0.85), with low obfuscation (around 0)."
