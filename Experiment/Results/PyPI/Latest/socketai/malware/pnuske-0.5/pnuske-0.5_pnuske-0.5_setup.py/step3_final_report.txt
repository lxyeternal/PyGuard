{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata, discover packages, and set up a console script entry point for the 'pnuske' CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including name, version, packages, and entry_points.",
  "sinks": "The 'pnuske:run' function invoked as an entry point, which could execute arbitrary code within the 'pnuske' module.",
  "flows": "During installation or execution, invoking 'pnuske' triggers 'pnuske:run', which may execute code from the 'pnuske' module.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward setup script with standard structure and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The entry point 'pnuske:run' is typical for CLI tools, but its behavior depends on the 'pnuske' module implementation, which is not provided. The scores from the reports (malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0-0.1) are consistent with this benign assessment. The minimal risk score accounts for potential arbitrary code execution in the 'pnuske' module, but no evidence suggests malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The minimal security risk score reflects the potential for the entry point to execute code, which is typical for CLI tools but not inherently malicious. The code is safe for use, assuming the 'pnuske' module's implementation is trustworthy.",
