  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The minimal security risk score reflects the potential for the entry point to execute code, which is typical for CLI tools but not inherently malicious. The code is safe for use, assuming the 'pnuske' module's implementation is trustworthy."
