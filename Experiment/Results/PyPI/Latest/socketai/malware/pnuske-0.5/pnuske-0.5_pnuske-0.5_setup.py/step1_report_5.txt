{
  "purpose": "Define package configuration and installation script for the 'pnuske' Python package.",
  "sources": "setuptools import, setup() function call, find_packages(), entry_points",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or execute external commands from untrusted sources",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing setuptools, defining package metadata, discovering packages, and setting a console script entry point",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code appears to be a standard package setup script with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code segments",
  "analysis": "The script imports the standard setuptools library for packaging. It specifies the package name and version, automatically finds packages in the directory, and sets up a console script entry point to 'pnuske=pnuske:run'. All functions and syntax are typical for a setup.py file. No external inputs, data flows, or suspicious code constructs are present. The entry point points to a function 'run' inside the 'pnuske' module, which is standard for executable scripts, but the content of that function is unknown and cannot be assessed here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal configuration file for distributing a Python package.",
