{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'pnuske' including package discovery and console script entry point.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources; relies on package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "Potentially the entry point 'pnuske=pnuske:run' could invoke code that is not shown here; within this snippet, no malicious sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this setup script itself; the entry point suggests external execution of 'pnuske:run'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated parts are present in this snippet. Usage of setup and find_packages() is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup using setuptools. It defines package metadata and entry points for command-line execution. No suspicious or malicious code, data leaks, or security issues are observable in this snippet. The entry point depends on external 'pnuske' module, but no malicious behavior can be inferred from this configuration alone.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is straightforward and standard, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on this code snippet.",
