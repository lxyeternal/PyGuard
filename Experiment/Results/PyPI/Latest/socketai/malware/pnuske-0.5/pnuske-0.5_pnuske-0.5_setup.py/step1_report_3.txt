{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pnuske', defining package metadata and entry point.",
  "sources": "Package metadata (name, version), find_packages() function, entry_points dictionary",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'pnuske:run' entry point (implying execution of code in pnuske module)",
  "flows": "setup() call uses find_packages() to identify packages, and specifies an entry point 'pnuske:run' to be executed as a console script",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup script with no hardcoded credentials or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools functions, defines package metadata, uses find_packages() to automatically include packages, and sets a console script entry point. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity. The entry point suggests executable code in the 'pnuske' module, but without its content, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines how to package and run the 'pnuske' project.",
