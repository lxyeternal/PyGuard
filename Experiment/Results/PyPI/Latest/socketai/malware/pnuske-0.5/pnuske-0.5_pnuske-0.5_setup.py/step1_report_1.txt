{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'pnuske'.",
  "sources": "Reads package configuration data such as package name, version, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "Executes the 'pnuske:run' function when the command-line script is invoked.",
  "flows": "The setup script defines package metadata; the entry point 'pnuske=pnuske:run' implies calling the 'run' function from the 'pnuske' module when the script is executed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, and no unusual behavior. The code only defines package metadata and a command-line entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It specifies package details and creates a console script pointing to 'pnuske:run'. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection. The entry point could execute arbitrary code within 'pnuske.py', but this is typical for CLI tools and not inherently malicious without further context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this code.",
