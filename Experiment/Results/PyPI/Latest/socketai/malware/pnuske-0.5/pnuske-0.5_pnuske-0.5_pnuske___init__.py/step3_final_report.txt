{
  "purpose": "Minimal import statement, likely used to include a function 'run' from a local module 'main' in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module, which reads the 'run' function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import of 'run' from local module; no data flow or execution beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward relative import with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of 'run' from a local module 'main'. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The import is standard in Python projects. The lack of data flows, external network activity, or code execution indicates benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the code's simplicity. Slightly higher risk scores (e.g., 0.1 or 0.9) are unjustified given the minimal code and should be lowered to 0 for accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal import statement poses no security risk. The scores should be adjusted to reflect the benign nature, setting malware, obfuscated, and risk scores to 0.",
