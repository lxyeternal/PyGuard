{
  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement suggests reading the 'main' module and the 'run' object within it.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident data sinks in this code snippet itself; potential risks depend on how 'run' is used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Importing 'run' from 'main' indicates potential flow of execution to the 'run' function, but no execution occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; importing from a relative module is standard. No suspicious or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "This snippet is a simple import statement with no executable logic or data processing. It relies on external modules. Since it does not perform any actions, there are no apparent security issues. The only consideration is whether the imported 'main' module or 'run' function contains malicious code, but that is outside the scope of this snippet. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior is evident here.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious intent. It appears to be part of a larger codebase where 'run' is invoked elsewhere. No security risks are identifiable from this fragment alone.",
