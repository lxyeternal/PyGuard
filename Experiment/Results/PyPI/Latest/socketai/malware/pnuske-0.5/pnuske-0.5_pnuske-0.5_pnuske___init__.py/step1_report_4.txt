{
  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from the local 'main' module, likely to execute or facilitate the main functionality of a package or script.",
  "sources": "The code imports from a relative module, which indicates reading code structure and possibly the 'run' function definition within 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or sensitive operations are present in this line; potential sinks depend on how 'run' is used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The code's flow involves importing 'run' from 'main', which could lead to execution if 'run' is called later, but this snippet alone does not execute any code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement using relative import syntax. It does not process data, perform network operations, or execute any actions. Without further context, it appears benign, serving as part of a larger module or package. No malicious indicators, such as data exfiltration or backdoors, are visible here. The minimal structure suggests standard code organization.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears normal and safe, but further context is needed for comprehensive assessment.",
