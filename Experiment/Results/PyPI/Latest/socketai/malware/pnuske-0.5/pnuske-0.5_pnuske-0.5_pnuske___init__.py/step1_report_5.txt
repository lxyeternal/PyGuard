  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code imports from a local module; no external input or data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling identified; no data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow present within this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, only a relative import statement; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward relative import of 'run' from 'main'. It does not contain any logic, data handling, or external communication. Due to its simplicity, there are no sources or sinks, nor any flow of untrusted data. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are detectable in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger module and is benign in isolation.",
