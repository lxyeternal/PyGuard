{
  "purpose": "Imports the 'run' function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module file 'main.py'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing is present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable from this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, just a relative import, with no apparent suspicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement, which is a common pattern in Python packages to organize code. There are no visible data inputs, outputs, or side effects. Given the brevity, there are no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The import suggests usage of the 'run' function from 'main', but without additional context or code, no malicious intent can be inferred. The minimal structure indicates normal modular design.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical part of a larger codebase, and on its own, it poses no security concern.",
