  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import statement. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9 seems high given the benign nature. The confidence is 0.9, but the risk score should be lower.  \n- **Justification:** Since the code is just an import, the risk should be minimal. Unless the 'main' module is malicious (which cannot be determined here), the risk score should be near zero.  \n- **Recommendation:** Reduce the securityRisk score from 0.9 to 0.1 or 0, aligning with the benign assessment. The malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; a straightforward import with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws in reasoning.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.  \n- **Justification:** The risk score is slightly above zero, which might overstate the risk given the minimal code. It’s acceptable but could be lowered to 0.0.  \n- **Recommendation:** Lower securityRisk to 0.0, as no risk is demonstrated.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** The assessment is consistent.  \n- **Recommendation:** Keep as is.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.  \n- **Justification:** The risk score could be lowered to 0, given the code’s benign nature.  \n- **Recommendation:** Reduce securityRisk to 0.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign and minimal.  \n- The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0.  \n- The security risk scores are slightly overstated in some reports (e.g., 0.9, 0.1). Given the simplicity of the code, these should be lowered to 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Metric          | Suggested Score |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware         | 0               |\n| Obfuscated      | 0               |\n| Security Risk   | 0               |\n\n**Note:** The minimal import statement alone does not pose any security risk or malware threat. The risk assessments should reflect that.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of recommendations:**  \n- Reduce all 'securityRisk' scores to 0.  \n- Keep 'malware' and 'obfuscated' scores at 0.  \n- Confirm that the code snippet itself is not malicious; the reports' conclusions are correct.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a detailed explanation for each change!",
