  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import statement; no issues are present.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0. The confidence is high (0.9). The assessment seems accurate.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concern.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal import; no issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1. The risk score might be slightly high for such a benign snippet; however, since the report suggests potential usage elsewhere, a small risk score (e.g., 0.1) is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected here.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Again, just an import statement.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0. The risk score is zero, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal import.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1. Similar to report 2, a very low risk score is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0. The highest confidence (1) supports the benign assessment.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (small potential concern if the imported function is malicious, but not evident here)\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is benign and well-understood.",
