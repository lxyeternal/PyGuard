  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .main import run\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Is the reported code present?**  \n  Yes. All reports describe the same minimal import statement, which matches the code snippet.\n\n### Logical consistency:\n- The reports correctly identify that this is a simple relative import of `run` from a local module `main`.\n- They consistently note that there are no data flows, no execution, no obfuscation, and no suspicious activity within this snippet.\n\n### Error or flaws in reasoning:\n- No errors are evident. The assessments are consistent and accurate given the code.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the minimal, benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting negligible risk based solely on this snippet.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Potential malicious behavior:** The code itself is benign. However, the true risk depends on how the `run` function is used elsewhere. Since the reports focus only on this import statement, their assessments are reasonable.\n- **Assumptions about `run`:** The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent without further context.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code is a standard import statement, common in Python projects.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.\n- The minimal nature of the code limits the scope of security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n**Based on the evidence, I would assign the following scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward import statement with no suspicious or malicious indicators. The risk scores should reflect the benign nature unless further context reveals malicious use.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
