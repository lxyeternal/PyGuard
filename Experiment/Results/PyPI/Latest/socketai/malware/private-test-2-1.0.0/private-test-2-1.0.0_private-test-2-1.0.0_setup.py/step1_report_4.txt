  "purpose": "The script customizes the installation process of a Python package to collect and send system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), username (getpass.getuser()), and output of 'ls' command (subprocess.check_output(['ls']))",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST request to 'http://192.198.82.14:3000/log' using requests.post()",
  "flows": "Collects system info from sources and posts data directly to remote server in the run() method of CustomInstall class during package installation",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to execute 'ls' command and send its output remotely; hardcoded IP address and URL for logging; no user consent or obfuscation; potential privacy invasion",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the standard setuptools installation process by subclassing 'install' and overriding run(). During installation, it gathers hostname, current directory, username, and output of 'ls' command. It then sends this data unencrypted to a hardcoded remote server. This behavior is atypical and indicates data exfiltration. The use of subprocess to run 'ls' and immediately post data is suspicious, especially since no user notification or consent is present. The hardcoded IP address and URL suggest malicious intent or tracking. Overall, the code performs system information collection and exfiltration during installation, which is malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and sending it to a remote server during package installation without user consent. This constitutes a privacy invasion and potential security risk.",
