{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process of a Python package to collect system information and send it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading system data: hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), username (getpass.getuser()), and directory listing (subprocess.check_output(['ls']))",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data via HTTP POST request to http://192.198.82.14:3000/log using requests.post()",
  "flows": "System information is gathered from sources and then transmitted over the network to the specified IP address via requests.post()",
  "anomalies": "The code silently sends sensitive environment details and directory contents to an external server without user consent or transparency. Use of subprocess to execute 'ls' and immediate network transmission without validation or encryption is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the setuptools installation process with a custom class that, during installation, executes 'ls' to list directory contents, collects hostname, current working directory, and username, and then sends this data to an external IP address via an HTTP POST request. The data collection occurs automatically during installation, indicating possible data exfiltration. No obfuscation or encoding is used. The remote server address appears suspicious, and no authorization or encryption is evident, raising security concerns. The code does not include any input validation or error handling, but no malicious code like system modification or malware installation is present. Overall, the code appears to be covertly harvesting system data and transmitting it externally.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data collection and exfiltration during package installation, indicating malicious intent to spy or gather user system information without consent. It is a clear security threat due to untrusted external communication and covert data gathering.",
