  "anomalies": "Collection and transmission of system information during installation without user consent; sending data to a suspicious IP address (192.198.82.14:3000). No authentication or encryption present.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'run' method of a custom install class to execute 'ls' command, gather hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data to an external IP address. The data collection occurs during installation, which is suspicious. The IP address is within private IP range, but the transmission of system info during setup indicates potential spying or backdoor activity. The code does not use secure transmission (no HTTPS), and there is no user notification or consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information during installation and exfiltrating it to an external server without user consent. This is indicative of a supply chain attack or backdoor presence.",
