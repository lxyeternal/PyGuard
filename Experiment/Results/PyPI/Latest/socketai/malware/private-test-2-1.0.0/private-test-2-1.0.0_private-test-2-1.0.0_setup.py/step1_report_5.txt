{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process of a Python package to collect system information and send it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname (socket.gethostname), current working directory (os.getcwd), username (getpass.getuser), and directory listing (subprocess.check_output(['ls']))",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data via HTTP POST request to http://192.198.82.14:3000/log",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, username, ls_output) -> Data aggregation in 'ploads' -> Sink (requests.post to remote URL)",
  "anomalies": "The code collects system info and directory listing and transmits it without user consent or notification, which is suspicious. The remote IP (192.198.82.14) is hardcoded. No input validation or encryption is performed. No clear legitimate purpose is provided for data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The script redefines the 'install' command in setuptools to execute a custom run method. During installation, it executes 'ls' to list directory contents and collects system information such as hostname, current directory, and username. These data points are aggregated into a dictionary and sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded IP address. There are no checks for user consent or security measures like encryption. The data transmission appears to be stealthy and potentially malicious, aiming to exfiltrate system info during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information without user consent during package installation. The use of hardcoded IP addresses, data collection, and transmission to a remote server indicates malicious intent. It should be considered malicious with high confidence.",
