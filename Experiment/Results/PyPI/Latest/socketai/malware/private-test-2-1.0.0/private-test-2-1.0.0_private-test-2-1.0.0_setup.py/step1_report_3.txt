  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to gather system information and send it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading system information (hostname, current working directory, username, directory listing) and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via HTTP POST request to a remote IP address.",
  "flows": "Gather system info (sources) and send it over network (sink) during the custom install process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to execute 'ls' command and immediate transmission of sensitive system info to an external IP address; hardcoded IP address; no user consent or transparency.",
  "analysis": "The script hooks into the 'install' command of setuptools to execute code during package installation. It retrieves system information such as hostname, current directory, username, and directory contents, then sends this data to an external server at 192.198.82.14:3000 via HTTP POST. This behavior resembles data exfiltration without user awareness or consent, indicating malicious intent. No obfuscation or complex code is present; the behavior is straightforward but suspicious due to privacy invasion and potential for misuse. The remote IP is hardcoded, and the data collection occurs automatically during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs potentially malicious activity by collecting system data and transmitting it to a remote server during package installation, constituting a privacy violation and possible security risk. The code appears intentionally designed to exfiltrate data, thus representing malicious behavior.",
