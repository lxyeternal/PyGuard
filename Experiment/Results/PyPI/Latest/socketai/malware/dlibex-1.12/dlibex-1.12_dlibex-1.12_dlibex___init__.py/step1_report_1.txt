  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow present in the provided code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement using relative import syntax. This is typical for Python packages to organize code modularly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as obfuscated code, data exfiltration, or malicious imports. Given the limited context, the code appears benign and standard for Python package structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement without any malicious intent or security issues. It does not present any risks based on the provided fragment.",
