  "purpose": "Import the get_file function from a local module named module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the import does not involve data transfer or execution beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward import statement with no suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of get_file from a local module. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or code execution. The potential for malicious behavior depends entirely on the implementation of get_file, which is not provided. Given only this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security issues. The minimal code and standard import pattern suggest a benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate, considering the potential risk if get_file is malicious, but the import itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified as a conservative measure accounting for the unknown implementation of get_file. Overall, the assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet.",
