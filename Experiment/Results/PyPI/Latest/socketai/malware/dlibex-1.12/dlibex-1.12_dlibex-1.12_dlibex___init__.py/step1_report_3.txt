  "purpose": "Importing a function 'get_file' from a local module, likely used for file retrieval or handling.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident from this snippet; it only imports a function.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious behavior are apparent. The module name and function seem standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import operation from a local module, which is common in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious code, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports. The function 'get_file' could be benign or malicious depending on its implementation, but based solely on this import statement, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a basic import statement with no malicious indicators. It appears to be a standard component of a larger program, and there are no immediate security concerns.",
