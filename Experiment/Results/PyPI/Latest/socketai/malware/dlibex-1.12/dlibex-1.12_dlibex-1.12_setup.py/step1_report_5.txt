  "purpose": "Define the package metadata and dependencies for the 'dlibex' Python library.",
  "sources": "The setup.py file itself, primarily the 'setup()' function call and its arguments.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or sensitive data handling present in this static setup.py script.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static configuration without dynamic data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The description explicitly states: 'This library is used for malware development. For educational purposes only!'. This is an unusual and suspicious claim for a package intended for distribution.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py file contains typical package setup code with standard dependencies and metadata. The critical anomaly is the description indicating the package's purpose is related to malware development, which strongly suggests malicious intent or at least malicious utility. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated code, or hardcoded credentials. The package dependencies are benign ('requests'), but the stated purpose is highly suspicious. This could imply the package may contain or facilitate malicious behavior not visible in this static script, possibly in other parts of the package code.",
  "conclusion": "The package metadata explicitly claims the package is used for malware development, which indicates malicious intent or utility. While the setup script itself appears standard, the description's nature is suspicious and warrants caution. Without examining additional source files, the risk is high due to the declared purpose.",
