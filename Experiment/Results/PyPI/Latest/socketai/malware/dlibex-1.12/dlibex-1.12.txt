      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign and standard; the main concern is the suspicious description claiming malware development, which indicates malicious intent or misuse potential. The actual code does not contain malicious behavior, but the description warrants caution. Therefore, the malware score should be low, and the security risk moderate, reflecting suspicion rather than active malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified as a conservative measure accounting for the unknown implementation of get_file. Overall, the assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, involving remote code execution, concealment, and lack of validation. It aligns with typical supply chain attack patterns and malware behaviors. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score should reflect this."
