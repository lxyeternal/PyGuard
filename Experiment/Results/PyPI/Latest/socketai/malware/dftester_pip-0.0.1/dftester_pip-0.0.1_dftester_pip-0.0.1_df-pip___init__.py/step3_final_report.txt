  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, environment variables, network connections, file reads, dynamic code execution, hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system modifications, system commands, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into code execution, network requests, or data processing functions, potentially leading to data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded IPs or secrets, suspicious network activity, unusual variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are suspicious but not definitive of malicious intent. Hardcoded IPs and network interactions increase concern. Absence of such features suggests benign behavior. The scores assigned in the reports reflect these observations, with Report 3 showing moderate suspicion justified by described behaviors. Reports lacking code appropriately assign zero scores. The overall risk assessment aligns with the described indicators, with the highest concern in Report 3. No concrete malicious payloads are identified, so the malware score remains below 0.5. The obfuscation score correlates with the presence of obfuscated code snippets. The risk score is justified by the potential for malicious activity based on suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that the scores in Report 3 are justified given the suspicious features, while other reports correctly identify benign or insufficient data scenarios. No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are consistent and cautious.",
