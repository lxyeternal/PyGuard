  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform data processing or functionality related to a larger application, but without the actual code provided, the specific intent cannot be precisely determined.",
  "sources": "Input sources may include environment variables, user inputs, or external data files (if present in the code). Since no code is provided, specific sources cannot be identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network calls, file writes, or execution functions where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks. Details are unavailable without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks potentially through functions or data handling routines. No explicit flow can be identified without the actual code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns can be identified without the code snippet provided. The code is missing, preventing detection of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of the code snippet, a step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Without the actual code, it is impossible to identify sources, sinks, data flows, or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to determine the purpose, behavior, or security risk of the code. Please provide the code snippet for a thorough review.",
