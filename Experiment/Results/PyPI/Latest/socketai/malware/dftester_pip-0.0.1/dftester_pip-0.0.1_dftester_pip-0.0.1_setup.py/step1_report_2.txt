{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a malicious Python package that, when installed or imported, executes reverse shells on the victim's machine to connect back to an attacker's server.",
  "sources": "The code reads external scripts from URLs (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xe2d0/evil-pip/main/scripts/linux.txt and .../windows.txt), and executes their content as Python code after replacing IP and port values.",
  "sinks": "The payload, fetched from remote URLs and executed via subprocess Popen with 'python -c', acts as a sink where malicious code is executed, establishing reverse shells.",
  "flows": "Sources: URL fetches -> Payload string manipulation -> Subprocess execution. Flows from remote script download through payload modification to execution as background process.",
  "anomalies": "The code directly downloads and executes external scripts without validation, uses hardcoded attacker IP and port, and executes system commands to run malicious payloads. No legitimate functionality is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and retrieves external scripts designed for reverse shells, replaces IP and port placeholders, and executes the scripts in the background depending on the OS. This indicates clear malicious intent to establish unauthorized remote access. The setup function misleadingly appears as a normal package setup but is used here to distribute malicious code. No legitimate functionality or benign behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code designed to establish reverse shells on target machines, indicating high malicious intent. It fetches and executes external scripts to gain remote control, making it highly dangerous. The overall security risk score is very high, and the malware score confirms malicious behavior.",
