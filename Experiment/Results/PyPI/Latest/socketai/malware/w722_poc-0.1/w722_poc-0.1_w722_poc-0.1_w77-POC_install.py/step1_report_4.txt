  "purpose": "The code executes a subprocess to run a curl command that makes an HTTPS request to a specific URL.",
  "sources": "The command array containing the URL, which is hardcoded into the script.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run executes the command, potentially sending data to the specified URL.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded URL is used as the target for the curl command, which is invoked via subprocess.run.",
  "anomalies": "The URL points to webhook.site, commonly used for testing or capturing HTTP requests; no other unusual or obfuscated code detected. The script makes a network request without user input, but the intent depends on context.",
  "analysis": "The script imports subprocess and defines a function run_command that executes a curl command targeting a specific URL. The command uses verbose mode and ignores SSL certificate validation. No user input is used, and the URL appears to be a test webhook endpoint. While the code itself is straightforward, its purpose could be benign testing or data exfiltration. Given the URL is a webhook testing service, it may be used for monitoring or testing purposes, not necessarily malicious. However, if used without context or authorization, it could be suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a network request to a known testing webhook URL using subprocess. It does not contain malicious code by itself but could be used for tracking or data collection depending on context. No malware or obfuscated code detected.",
