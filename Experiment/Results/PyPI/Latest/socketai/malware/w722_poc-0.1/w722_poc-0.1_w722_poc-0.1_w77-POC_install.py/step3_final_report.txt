{
  "purpose": "Execute an HTTPS request to a specified webhook URL using curl via subprocess.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded URL in the command list, subprocess.run call.",
  "sinks": "External network connection to webhook.site, potentially leaking data or signaling external server.",
  "flows": "Source: hardcoded URL and command; sink: subprocess executing curl; flow: command executes outbound request to the URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '-k' to disable SSL verification, silent outbound request, no input validation, no response handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward subprocess call to curl with verbose and insecure SSL flags targeting a webhook URL. No obfuscation, payloads, or dynamic input are present. The main security concern is the use of '-k', which disables SSL verification, potentially exploitable in malicious contexts. The request to a webhook site is typical for testing but could be used maliciously for data exfiltration. Malware score is low (0) due to absence of malicious payloads; security risk is moderate (~0.3) because of insecure SSL and silent network activity. No suspicious control flow or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation, primarily used for testing or monitoring. The main risks involve insecure SSL verification and silent outbound requests, which could be exploited if misused. No evidence of malicious payloads or obfuscation is present. Scores should reflect low malware risk (0) and a modest security risk (~0.3).",
