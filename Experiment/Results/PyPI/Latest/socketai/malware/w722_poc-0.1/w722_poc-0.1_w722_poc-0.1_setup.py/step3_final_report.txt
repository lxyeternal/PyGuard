{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools, with no embedded commands or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description; package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no execution of external commands or network activity.",
  "flows": "No command execution or data flow from sources to sinks; setup process is static.",
  "anomalies": "Discrepancy between description claiming execution of a curl command and the actual code, which contains none.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no embedded or executed commands. The description's claim about executing a curl command is not reflected in the code, indicating a misleading or incomplete documentation. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate, considering the discrepancy but lack of actual malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The package code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The description's claim is likely misleading or incomplete. Overall, the code poses a very low security risk, and the scores are consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
