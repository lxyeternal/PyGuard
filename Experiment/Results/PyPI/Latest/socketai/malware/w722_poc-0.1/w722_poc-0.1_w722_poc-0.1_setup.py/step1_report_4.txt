{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for a Python package named 'w722-poc'.",
  "sources": "Code reads package metadata, version info, and reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data output or execution points.",
  "flows": "Reads metadata and README content during setup; no data flows leading to potentially harmful actions.",
  "anomalies": "Potential concern: the description states the package executes a curl command upon installation, but no such command or execution logic is present in this setup script. The setup script itself does not execute or include malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports setuptools, defines package metadata, and reads the README file for description. There is no code executing external commands or handling untrusted input. The description mentions executing a curl command, but no such command is present in this code. The script appears standard for package configuration. No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified in this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup configuration with no embedded malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. The mention of executing a curl command is only in the description and not reflected in actual code, thus no malicious activity is present.",
