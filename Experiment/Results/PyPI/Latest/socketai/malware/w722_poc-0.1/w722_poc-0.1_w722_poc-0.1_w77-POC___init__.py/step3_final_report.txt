  "purpose": "The code imports and executes run_command from a local module, potentially executing arbitrary commands.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .install module, execution of run_command()",
  "sinks": "Execution of run_command() which could perform system calls or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Import -> run_command() execution",
  "anomalies": "Immediate execution of imported function without validation; no input validation or error handling shown",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing run_command and executing it immediately. The behavior depends entirely on the implementation of run_command. Without inspecting run_command, we cannot determine if it performs malicious actions. The pattern is common but potentially risky if run_command executes untrusted code or system commands. The scores assigned in reports are generally moderate, reflecting uncertainty. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. The main risk stems from the unknown behavior of run_command, which warrants further review of the install module. The code itself is straightforward and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern is potentially risky but not malicious by itself. The primary concern is the implementation of run_command. Current scores are appropriate given the lack of implementation details. Further review of run_command is necessary to assess actual security risk.",
