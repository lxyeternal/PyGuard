{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes a function called run_command, likely to perform some installation or setup task.",
  "sources": "The source is the imported run_command function from a local module install.",
  "sinks": "The sink is the invocation of run_command(), which may execute arbitrary commands.",
  "flows": "The imported run_command() function is called immediately after import, potentially executing code that could be malicious depending on its implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code directly executes a function from a local module without any input validation or safeguards; the function's behavior is unknown. The module and function name are generic, providing no clear context or restrictions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports run_command from a local module and immediately calls it. Since run_command's implementation is not provided, its behavior could range from benign to malicious (e.g., executing system commands). The lack of validation or context raises concern, especially if the module or function can execute system commands or perform sensitive operations. This pattern could be exploited if run_command is malicious or compromised. The code is minimal but potentially dangerous depending on the implementation of run_command.",
  "conclusion": "The code's simplicity masks potential security risks, as it relies entirely on an external function whose behavior is unknown. Without further context, there is a moderate concern that run_command could perform malicious actions. This pattern warrants further review of the run_command function's implementation to assess risks.",
