{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes a function called run_command from a local module named install.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'install' to import run_command.",
  "sinks": "The code executes run_command(), which may execute system commands or code; the potential sink is the execution of this function, which could run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The source is the import of run_command from install; the sink is the call to run_command(), which may execute system commands or code.",
  "anomalies": "The code directly calls run_command() immediately after import without validation, which could be suspicious if run_command executes arbitrary or malicious system commands. The code is minimal and lacks context, which raises concern about what run_command does.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal: it imports a single function from a local module and executes it. The security implications heavily depend on the implementation of run_command in the install module. Without inspecting that function, we cannot definitively determine malicious intent. The pattern is simple but potentially dangerous if run_command executes system commands or performs malicious actions. The code structure is straightforward but sparse, which could be a sign of obfuscation or malicious intent, although it might also be legitimate. Due to the lack of additional context or code, the overall assessment is limited.",
  "conclusion": "The code calls a function from a local module immediately after import, which could be malicious depending on run_command's implementation. No external inputs or malicious indicators are visible here, but the pattern warrants review of the run_command function for potential malicious behavior.",
