  "purpose": "Invoke the run_command function from a local install module",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.install' and the call to run_command()",
  "sinks": "The run_command() function execution could be a sink if it executes untrusted commands or scripts",
  "flows": "Import of run_command() -> execution of run_command()",
  "anomalies": "Lack of context about what run_command() does; potential risk if run_command executes arbitrary or malicious commands",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function run_command from a local module '.install' and immediately executes it. Without the implementation details of run_command, it's uncertain what actions it performs. This pattern could be benign if run_command performs a safe, predefined operation, but it also could be malicious if run_command executes arbitrary code, system commands, or malicious payloads. The minimal code provides no safeguards, validation, or context to evaluate its safety. Relying solely on this fragment, there is a potential concern about malicious activity, especially if run_command executes untrusted inputs or system commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code's safety depends entirely on the implementation of run_command. Given only this snippet, there is a potential risk that run_command may execute malicious commands, but no definitive malicious behavior can be confirmed without further details. Caution is advised.",
