{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes a function named run_command from a local module named install.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.install' and execution of run_command()",
  "sinks": "Execution of run_command() as a sink where untrusted input could potentially be processed or executed",
  "flows": "Import from '.install' -> run_command() execution",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; the code directly calls an imported function without additional context. The content of run_command() is unknown, which is a potential concern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports run_command from a local module, then calls it immediately. Without knowledge of the implementation of run_command(), it’s impossible to determine if it contains malicious code. The pattern suggests potential for malicious activity if run_command() executes arbitrary or harmful commands. There are no obfuscation indicators or suspicious code constructs visible here. Since the function's behavior is unknown, the risk depends entirely on its implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is simple and does not inherently contain malicious behavior, but the use of an externally imported function executed immediately warrants caution. The security risk depends on what run_command() does within the install module.",
