{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'run_command' from a local module 'install' and executes it. Its purpose is likely to perform some installation or setup operation.",
  "sources": "The source of data is the local module 'install' which provides the 'run_command' function.",
  "sinks": "The sink is the execution of 'run_command()', which could execute system commands if 'run_command' runs untrusted input or system calls.",
  "flows": "The flow is from importing 'run_command' from 'install' -> calling 'run_command()'. If 'run_command' internally executes system commands or untrusted input, this could lead to potential security issues.",
  "anomalies": "There are no apparent anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module and executes it. Without the implementation of 'run_command', it's impossible to determine if it contains malicious behavior. The act of calling 'run_command' is potentially risky if the function executes system commands with untrusted input, but the code itself does not provide such context. No obfuscation, malicious indicators, or anomalies are visible here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and by itself does not demonstrate malicious intent. Its safety depends entirely on the implementation of 'run_command'. Without additional context, there is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. It warrants review of the 'install' module's 'run_command' function for further security assessment.",
