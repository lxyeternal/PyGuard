{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes from local modules and defines an export list, likely for a package or module interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external effects are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only module imports and exports are defined",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an explicit __all__ list, which is standard for defining module exports. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or other behaviors that could indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python module patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module file with simple imports and export declarations. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code.",
