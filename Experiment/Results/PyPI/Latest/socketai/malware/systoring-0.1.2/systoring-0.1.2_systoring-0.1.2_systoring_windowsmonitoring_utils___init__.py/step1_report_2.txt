  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from local modules and defines an export list for a package or module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (.ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or output sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; merely importing modules and defining exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module imports and exports within a package. It uses relative imports to include classes from sibling modules, then exposes them via __all__. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code structure and content are typical for Python packages and do not raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module that solely manages imports and exports. No malicious or security-risk elements are identified.",
