{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer that imports specific classes from sibling modules and exposes them via the __all__ list for public API definition.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from sibling modules (.ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb). No external input or data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements and a definition of __all__, with no data processing, network activity, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
