  "purpose": "Import platform-specific monitoring modules and initialize monitoring components",
  "sources": "Reads system information via platform.system() to determine environment; imports modules based on system",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data leaks; no data transmission or external commands",
  "flows": "Checks system type, then conditionally imports modules relevant to the environment",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected; conditional import appears standard",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system to conditionally import system-specific modules, which is a common pattern. It imports monitoring classes and initialization functions, but no execution of untrusted data, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is identified. The import logic appears straightforward and related to environment setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard environment-specific module imports for system monitoring; no malicious behavior, no anomalies, and no security risks identified.",
