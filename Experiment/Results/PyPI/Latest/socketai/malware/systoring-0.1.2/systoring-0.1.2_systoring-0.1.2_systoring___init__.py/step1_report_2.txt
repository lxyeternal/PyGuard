{
  "purpose": "The code imports system monitoring modules based on the operating system and exposes certain classes and functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Reads the platform.system() value to determine OS, and imports modules and functions from relative paths.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; imports are static and do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The platform.system() output influences conditional import; no data flows from external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import based on platform is normal; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports Windows-specific modules only when the platform is Windows, otherwise it imports macOS monitoring modules and other monitoring tools. It then exports these modules/functions for use elsewhere. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. The code structure is simple, standard, and unlikely to be malicious. It appears to be part of a system monitoring package tailored for different operating systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard platform-based imports for system monitoring, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a typical OS-dependent module loader with no suspicious activities.",
