  "purpose": "Initialize and start platform-specific system monitoring threads for Mac or Windows platforms.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call to determine OS, InputMonitor().start_monitoring() method, and the run methods of MacMonitor and WindowsMonitor classes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the start_monitoring() and run() methods could handle untrusted data or perform malicious actions depending on their implementations.",
  "flows": "platform.system() determines platform; input_monitor thread executes InputMonitor().start_monitoring(); system_monitor threads execute MacMonitor().run or WindowsMonitor().run based on platform.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or code that appears intentionally malicious. Use of threading for monitoring is common; no unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the operating system, then starts monitoring threads for input and system-specific monitoring. Imports are straightforward, and threading is used for concurrent execution. No evidence of malicious behavior or malicious data handling is visible. The monitoring functions' internal implementations are unknown, so potential malicious activities depend on those implementations, but this snippet itself does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard platform-dependent monitoring setup that initiates threads for input and system monitoring. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this fragment. It appears legitimate, assuming the imported classes behave normally.",
