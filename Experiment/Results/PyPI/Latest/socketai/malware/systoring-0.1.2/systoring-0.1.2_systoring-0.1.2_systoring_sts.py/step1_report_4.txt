  "purpose": "Initialize and start platform-specific system monitoring and input monitoring threads.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for OS detection; InputMonitor().start_monitoring() for input data; MacMonitor().run or WindowsMonitor().run for system monitoring.",
  "sinks": "InputMonitor().start_monitoring() potentially reads user input; MacMonitor().run and WindowsMonitor().run potentially access system info or sensors.",
  "flows": "platform.system() → conditional branch → starts input_monitor thread and platform-specific system_monitor thread.",
  "anomalies": "Use of threading for monitoring without any validation or access control; no visible data sanitization or security checks; dynamic import based on platform is typical, but could hide malicious modules if modules are compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the OS and starts two monitoring threads: one for user input and another for system-specific monitoring. The modules imported (MacMonitoring and InputMonitor) are from trusted-sounding paths, and no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data flows are present. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are apparent. The use of threading is standard for monitoring tasks. There are no signs of obfuscated code, data leakage, or malicious intent in this fragment. Overall, the code appears straightforward and benign, focused on system monitoring setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code initializes platform-specific monitoring threads with no evident malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose of system and input monitoring. No security risks or malware are detected in this fragment.",
