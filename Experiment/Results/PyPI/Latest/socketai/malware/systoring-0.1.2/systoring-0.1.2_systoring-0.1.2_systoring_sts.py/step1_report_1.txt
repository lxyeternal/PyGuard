  "purpose": "Initialize system monitoring for Mac or Windows platforms and start input monitoring in separate threads.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for OS detection; InputMonitor().start_monitoring() in a thread",
  "sinks": "Threads running monitoring functions; potential for indirect impact if monitoring functions are malicious",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> input_monitor thread -> system_monitor thread",
  "anomalies": "Use of threading for monitoring; dynamic import of platform-specific monitoring classes; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system, initializes input monitoring in a separate thread, and conditionally starts platform-specific monitoring threads. Imports appear standard for monitoring purposes. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The monitoring classes are assumed to be legitimate but depend on external implementation. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for platform-specific system and input monitoring using threading, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical monitoring setup without malicious intent.",
