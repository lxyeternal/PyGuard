  "purpose": "Initialize platform-specific system monitoring by starting threads for input and system monitoring based on OS.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call for OS detection, creation of InputMonitor and OS-specific monitor instances.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; code starts threads that invoke monitor methods.",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> OS-specific condition -> thread start of monitor methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system and starts threads for input monitoring and system monitoring accordingly. Uses standard threading and platform detection. No suspicious data handling, no external data sources, and no evident malicious actions. It appears to be a straightforward monitoring setup with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for platform-specific system monitoring initialization. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
