  "purpose": "Initialize platform-specific system and input monitoring via threading based on detected OS.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for OS detection; InputMonitor().start_monitoring() for input data; platform-specific monitor classes (MacMonitor or WindowsMonitor) for system monitoring.",
  "sinks": "Threads executing monitor methods; no direct untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "OS detection flows into starting input monitoring thread and platform-specific system monitor thread; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward OS detection and initiates monitoring threads accordingly. Imports are from external modules presumed legitimate. No malicious or suspicious patterns are evident. The threading approach is standard for such tasks. The internal behavior of imported classes is unknown but assumed benign. No signs of obfuscation, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate platform-specific monitoring setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the low security risk score (~0.15) is appropriate given the benign analysis. External modules should be verified separately, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe.",
