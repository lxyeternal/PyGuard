  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate platform-specific monitoring setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the low security risk score (~0.15) is appropriate given the benign analysis. External modules should be verified separately, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe."
