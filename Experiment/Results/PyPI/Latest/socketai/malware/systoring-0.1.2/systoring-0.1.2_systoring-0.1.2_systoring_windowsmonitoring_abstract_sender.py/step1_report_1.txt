  "purpose": "Template class for sending monitoring data, designed for extension.",
  "sources": "Config object (SenderConfig), MultipartFormDataEncoder instance, and method parameters (zip_name, data, preview).",
  "sinks": "SSL context modification to disable SSL verification, potentially affecting secure connections.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly defined in this code snippet; likely flow involves calling __get_sender_data, __send_archive, and run methods in subclasses.",
  "anomalies": "Disabling SSL verification via _create_unverified_https() is a security concern; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class for a sender with methods to get data and send archives, including a static method to disable SSL verification. The disabling of SSL certificate validation can compromise security if used improperly, but it is a common practice in certain testing or internal scenarios. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. Usage of external modules is benign, assuming their integrity. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign template class for data sending, with a potentially insecure SSL setting that should be used cautiously. No malicious intent or malicious code detected.",
