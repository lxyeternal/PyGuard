{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an initialization or import module that consolidates and exports specific classes and enums for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (.windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils), which indicate data sources are the modules being imported.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system commands are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to importing and re-exporting symbols; there are no direct data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of local module imports is standard for package structure.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs import statements and defines __all__ for exports, serving as an index module. No runtime data processing, input handling, or potentially malicious behavior is present. It references local modules, which are common in package design, with no indication of malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initializer for packaging purposes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
