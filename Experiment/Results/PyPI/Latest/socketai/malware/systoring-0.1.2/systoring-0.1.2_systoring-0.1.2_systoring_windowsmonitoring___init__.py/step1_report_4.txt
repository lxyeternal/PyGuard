{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports classes and enums from other modules and defines its public interface.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data output present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; primarily import statements and __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enums from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or untrusted input handling. The structure is straightforward and standard for Python package modules. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident. As it is purely import and declaration statements, it provides no apparent attack surface.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initializer that manages imports and exports. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
