  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a package's __init__.py file, used to import and expose specific modules and classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling or processing occurs here",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable as this code only performs imports and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard package initialization pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and variables from local modules, then defines __all__ for namespace control. No data processing, user input, or network interactions occur here. The code structure is typical for Python package initialization files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package __init__.py file that facilitates module exports. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
