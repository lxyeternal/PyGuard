  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple module initializer, importing classes and constants from internal modules and defining `__all__`.\n- No data flows, user input, network activity, or external data handling are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code structure is standard for Python package `__init__.py` files.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None of the reports identify any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports confirm the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk:** All assign a risk score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0, indicating no malware activity detected or suspected.\n- **Confidence levels:** All are high (1), indicating strong agreement.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- Since the code is purely import/export with no data processing, no external interactions, and no anomalies, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n- The detailed reasoning supports that these are benign modules, likely part of a larger package.\n\n**Potential issues or overlooked points:**\n- No evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- The reports do not mention any indirect risks, such as supply chain issues via compromised dependencies, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores.\n- The code appears benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, benign module initializer with no signs of malicious or risky behavior.",
