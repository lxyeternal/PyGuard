  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or __init__.py file, importing specific classes and constants from internal modules and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely static import/export statements",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static import declarations only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup, importing classes and constants from internal modules and defining __all__ for exports. It contains no data processing, user input, network activity, or external interactions. The code structure is typical for Python package __init__.py files. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are consistent with its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reviews correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
