  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module import and export setup.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or security issues are identified.\n- The code is standard for Python package initialization (__init__.py) files.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets only perform import statements and define `__all__`.\n- There are no data flows, network activity, or untrusted input handling.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious constructs.\n- The reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Score evaluations:**\n- The malware score is correctly 0 across all reports; no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- Security risk is 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- Since the code is purely import/export, the risk scores could be considered very low or zero.\n- However, if the context of the larger project involved supply chain concerns, even benign code could be scrutinized for indirect risks. But based solely on this snippet, the risk remains minimal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores.\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n**Final note:**\nWhile the reports are correct, always consider that in a real-world scenario, context matters. If this code were part of a supply chain attack, the entire package's behavior should be analyzed. But based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
