  "conclusion": "The code pattern enables downloading and executing arbitrary files without validation, creating a high security risk. While it does not contain embedded malware, its behavior facilitates malicious activity if misused. The high scores assigned in the reports (around 0.75 for malware and 0.8 for security risk) are justified. The code should be considered unsafe for use in untrusted environments without proper validation, sanitization, and error handling."
