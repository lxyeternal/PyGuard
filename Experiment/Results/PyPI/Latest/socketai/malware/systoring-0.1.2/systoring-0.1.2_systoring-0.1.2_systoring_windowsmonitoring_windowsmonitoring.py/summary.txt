  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, functioning as a data stealer with stealth features such as SSL bypass and silent error suppression. The presence of hardcoded credentials and data exfiltration mechanisms confirms its malicious intent. The scores provided are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior, indicating a high-confidence classification as malware with significant security risk."
