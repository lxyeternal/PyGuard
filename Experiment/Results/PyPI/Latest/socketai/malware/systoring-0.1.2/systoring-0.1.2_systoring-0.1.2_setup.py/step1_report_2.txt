{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'systoring', intended for monitoring system events across platforms, primarily for educational purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; gathers package information and dependencies from the setup() function arguments.",
  "targets": "Uses the 'setup()' function to configure package installation, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "flows": "Reads external README.md file -> processes package setup parameters -> installs specified dependencies based on platform.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for long description, then defines package metadata, dependencies, and platform-specific extras. All code is straightforward and typical for package setup scripts. No suspicious or malicious code, data leaks, or security issues identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is designed solely to configure and package the 'systoring' project for distribution.",
