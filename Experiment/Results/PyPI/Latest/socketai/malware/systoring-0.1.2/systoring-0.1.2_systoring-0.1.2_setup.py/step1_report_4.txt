{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a cross-platform system monitoring library called 'systoring'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; user-specified dependencies in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data affects system or leaks data; setup configuration typically does not execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; the code only reads a local file and specifies dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The description mentions educational use only but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README file for description and specifies dependencies, including platform-specific extras. No code execution, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The dependencies are common for system monitoring tools and do not indicate malicious intent. The code structure and functions are typical and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It simply configures a package with specified dependencies and metadata.",
