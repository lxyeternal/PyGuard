  "purpose": "Standard package setup script for 'systoring' library, defining metadata, dependencies, and optional platform-specific requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, package metadata, dependencies, and extras.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no runtime data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> package setup configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, follows typical setup.py pattern, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools-based setup script. It reads a README file, specifies package info, dependencies, and optional extras for Windows and macOS. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. All dependencies are common, and the code structure is clear and conventional. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected. The code's simplicity and transparency support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is legitimate, benign, and free of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify it as a standard package configuration with no suspicious elements. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
