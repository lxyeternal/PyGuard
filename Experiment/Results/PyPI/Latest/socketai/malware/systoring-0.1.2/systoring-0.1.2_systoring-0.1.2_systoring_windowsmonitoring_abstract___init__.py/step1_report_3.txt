{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a module that exports an abstract sender class, likely intended for message or data sending functionality.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement: 'from .sender import AbstractSender'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. The code is very minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named AbstractSender from a local module named sender and then exposes it via __all__. There are no complex operations, no dynamic code execution, no data handling, and no evidence of malicious intent. It is a standard module definition with no apparent security risks or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module export with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears benign and intended for standard use in a larger project.",
