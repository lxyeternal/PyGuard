{
  "purpose": "The code exports the AbstractSender class from the sender module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing AbstractSender from a relative module 'sender'. No other input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths; the code solely performs a module export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module export statement. It imports AbstractSender from a local module and defines __all__ for explicit export. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external communication present. The code's simplicity suggests it's part of a larger project where AbstractSender likely defines some communication or sender logic, but this snippet alone does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as a straightforward module export. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues in this minimal snippet.",
