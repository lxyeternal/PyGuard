  "purpose": "Defines package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point for the Python package 'hhxy'.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; hardcoded author info; references external function 'install_and_run' in 'hhxy.main'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows within this script.",
  "flows": "Setup configuration references external function 'install_and_run' which may execute code when invoked, but not during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script. The invocation of 'install_and_run' could execute arbitrary code, but only when the CLI command is run, not during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no malicious or obfuscated code. It reads local files and defines package metadata and entry points. The only potential concern is the external function 'install_and_run', which could perform malicious actions if implemented maliciously. However, the script itself does not contain or execute such code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is minimal, around 0.1-0.2, reflecting the potential risk if the external function is malicious. Given the evidence, the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The risk is low, primarily dependent on the implementation of the external 'install_and_run' function, which is outside the scope of this script. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1-0.2 are justified and appropriate.",
