  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The risk is low, primarily dependent on the implementation of the external 'install_and_run' function, which is outside the scope of this script. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1-0.2 are justified and appropriate."
