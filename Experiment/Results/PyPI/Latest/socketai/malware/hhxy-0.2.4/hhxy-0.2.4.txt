The risk is low, primarily dependent on the implementation of the external 'install_and_run' function, which is outside the scope of this script. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1-0.2 are justified and appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing remote scripts without validation, representing a severe security risk. The behavior is consistent with malicious activity, warranting a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1. The code should be considered highly dangerous and avoided or modified to include validation steps."
