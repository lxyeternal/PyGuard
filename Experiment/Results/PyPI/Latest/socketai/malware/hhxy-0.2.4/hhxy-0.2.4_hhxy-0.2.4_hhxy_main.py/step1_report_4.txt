{
  "purpose": "The code downloads, sets permissions, and executes an external shell script.",
  "sources": "The URL from which the shell script is downloaded, and the current directory where the script is executed.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run commands executing the downloaded shell script, which could potentially perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Download shell script from external URL -> Change permissions -> Execute the script",
  "anomalies": "No validation or verification of the downloaded script's integrity or content; reliance on external URL without checks.",
  "analysis": "The code uses wget to download a shell script from an external server, then grants execute permissions and runs it. There is no validation or sanitization of the downloaded script, which could contain malicious commands. The script's source is an external URL, and executing it directly introduces high risk if the source is compromised or malicious. The code is straightforward but lacks safeguards such as checksum verification or access restrictions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is potentially malicious because it automatically downloads and executes a remote shell script without validation, posing a high security risk. It could execute any malicious commands contained within the script.",
