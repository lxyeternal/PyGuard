  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local 'info' module in the package.",
  "sources": "The line 'from .info import *' reads the 'info' module in the current package.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if 'info' contains malicious code, the imported symbols could be used maliciously later in the code.",
  "flows": "The import brings all symbols from 'info' into the current namespace; subsequent code may invoke these symbols, but no direct flow is observable here.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import '*' can hide imported symbols, potentially concealing malicious code if present in 'info'. No other anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of all symbols from the 'info' module. No malicious code or obfuscation is present in this line. The use of '*' is discouraged as it can hide imported symbols, but it is not inherently malicious. Without inspecting the 'info' module's contents, no definitive conclusion about malicious behavior can be made. The scores for malware and obfuscation are zero, which aligns with the benign appearance. The security risk score is low, reflecting the potential risk associated with wildcard imports but not indicating actual malicious activity. Confidence in benignity is high, given the simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and standard, with no evidence of malicious activity. The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which warrants review of the 'info' module's contents, but based solely on this line, the code is safe.",
