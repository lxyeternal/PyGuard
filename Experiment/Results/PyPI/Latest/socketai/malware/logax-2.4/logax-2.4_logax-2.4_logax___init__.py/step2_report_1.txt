  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Content:** Basic import of all symbols from `info`.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no anomalies.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high confidence that this is benign).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The import line itself is benign, and the high confidence aligns with that.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Content:** Import of all symbols from `info`.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of wildcard import can obscure what is imported.\n- **Findings:** No direct malicious activity, but the wildcard import is discouraged.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6 (moderate confidence).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The score for malware remains 0, which is appropriate since the line alone doesn't indicate malicious code. The securityRisk is slightly elevated due to the wildcard import, which can be risky if the imported module contains malicious code. The overall risk score of 0.1 seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Content:** Import of all from `.info`.\n- **Anomalies:** Importing everything with '*' can hide malicious code.\n- **Findings:** No direct malicious activity, but the style is risky.\n- **Confidence:** 0.3 (low confidence).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The malware score is 0, which is correct given the code. The securityRisk of 0.2 is justified because the wildcard import could hide malicious code if present in `info`. The low confidence is appropriate due to the inability to assess the imported module's contents.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Content:** Import all from `.info`.\n- **Findings:** Standard import, no anomalies.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 (high confidence that it's benign).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No indication of malicious activity or security risk. The high confidence is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Content:** Import all from `.info`.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The import line alone is benign, and the high confidence aligns with that.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement.\n- The use of wildcard import (`*`) is flagged as a potential concern, which is valid.\n- No report indicates actual malicious code, malware, or obfuscation.\n- Scores for malware are consistently 0, which is correct.\n- Security risk scores are slightly elevated in some reports due to the wildcard import, which is justified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Remain at 0 across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, since the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Keep low (around 0.1-0.2) for reports mentioning wildcard import, as it can hide malicious code if present, but the import itself is not malicious.\n\n### Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the wildcard import concern)\n\nThe reports are consistent with these assessments. No changes needed unless further context about the `info` module contents is provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe import statement is benign, but the use of wildcard import warrants cautious review of the `info` module. The scores are appropriate, and no evidence suggests malicious activity.",
