  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'info'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module, 'info'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling in this line.",
  "flows": "No data flows; this line only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can obscure what is being imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code, but by itself does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement using a relative import syntax. It imports all symbols from the 'info' module. Without additional context or code, this line alone does not exhibit malicious behavior. The use of wildcard import is generally discouraged as it can hide imported elements, but it is not inherently malicious. No further suspicious activity is detectable from this single line.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evident malicious intent or security risks based solely on this line. However, the use of wildcard import warrants cautious review of the 'info' module's contents for any malicious code.",
