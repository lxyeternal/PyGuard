  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import all symbols from local `info` module.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies this as a basic import with no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The import is straightforward, and the report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Notes that wildcard import can obscure what is imported, which is true, but does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, but warrants caution.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.6, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, which is reasonable given the wildcard import. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis:** Highlights that importing everything can hide malicious code if present in `info`.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity in this line but recommends caution.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.3, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The low confidence is justified because the line itself is benign, but the use of wildcard import warrants attention. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; no malicious activity, standard import.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.8, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** High confidence is acceptable here; the code is benign. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states it's a straightforward import with no anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Very high confidence is justified given the simplicity of the line.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the line is a simple import statement.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated in some reports due to wildcard import concerns, which is appropriate.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- Since the import line itself is benign, the main concern is the use of `*`, which can hide malicious code if present in `info`. However, without inspecting the actual `info` module, we cannot determine if malicious code exists there.\n\n### Final judgment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should stay at 0, since the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for hidden malicious code in the imported module, a cautious but justified risk score could be around **0.2** to **0.3** if considering the import style alone, but since the report scores are mostly at 0 or very low, and no actual malicious code is shown, a **0.1** or **0.2** seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (to reflect cautiousness due to wildcard import but no actual evidence)\n\n**Final note:** The import statement alone is not malicious, but the use of `*` warrants review of the `info` module contents. Without further code or context, the current scores are reasonable.",
