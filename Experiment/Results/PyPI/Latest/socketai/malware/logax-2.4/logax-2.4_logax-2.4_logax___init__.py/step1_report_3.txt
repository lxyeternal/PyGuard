  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the 'info' module within the same package.",

  "sinks": "None explicitly present in the code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with this single line; depends on imported module's behavior",
  "anomalies": "Importing everything with '*' can obscure the source of variables and functions, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal import statement that pulls in all public attributes from the 'info' module in the same package. Without inspecting the 'info' module itself, it's impossible to determine if malicious code resides there. The import style is risky because it obscures which components are imported and can inadvertently include malicious or unsafe code. The code itself does not perform any malicious actions but could be part of a larger, potentially malicious package depending on the contents of 'info'.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code alone is not inherently malicious but uses a risky import style that could hide malicious code if present in the 'info' module. Without inspecting 'info', confidence is low that this line alone is malicious, but it warrants caution.",
