  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the context provided.\n\n---\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- This is a relative import, importing all symbols from the `info` module in the same package.\n- The use of `*` (wildcard import) is generally discouraged because it obscures what is imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code.\n- The code itself is benign and standard in Python, but the security implications depend heavily on the contents of `info`.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No malicious activity or security risks detected; a standard import.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high certainty)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues identified. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Uses wildcard import; recommends cautious review of `info`.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The use of `*` can hide malicious code if present, but the import itself is not malicious. The slight security risk score is appropriate, considering the potential for hidden issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Highlights the risky nature of wildcard import; suggests caution.\n- **Confidence:** 0.3\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly conservative. The low confidence reflects uncertainty about the contents of `info`. The security risk score is appropriate given the potential for malicious code hiding in the imported module.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** No inherent malicious behavior; standard import.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The import line itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Simple import; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The line is straightforward and poses no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Scores and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as the import line alone does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- **Risk Score:** Most are 0 or very low, which aligns with the fact that this line alone is not risky unless the imported module contains malicious code.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- The import statement itself is standard and not malicious.\n- The use of `*` warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent by itself.\n- The primary concern should be inspecting the `info` module's contents, which cannot be determined from this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to wildcard import, but not inherently dangerous)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the analysis that this code is benign but warrants cautious review of the `info` module due to the use of wildcard import. No changes to scores are necessary based on the information provided.",
