  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their accuracy, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** Confirms that the import is benign, standard, and no malicious activity is evident.  \n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0  \n- **Assessment:** This is accurate. The import statement is straightforward, and without additional context, no issues are apparent.  \n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Recognizes the use of wildcard import, which can obscure imported symbols but does not inherently indicate malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** confidence=0.6, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the potential risk associated with wildcard imports. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate given the information.  \n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Highlights that importing everything with '*' can hide malicious code if present in 'info', but the import itself isn't malicious.  \n- **Scores:** confidence=0.3, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.2  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly emphasizes the risk of obscurity. The low confidence reflects uncertainty about the actual contents of 'info'.  \n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** States that this is a simple, non-malicious import with no apparent security issues.  \n- **Scores:** confidence=0.8, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The high confidence aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.  \n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, considers this a standard import with no malicious implications.  \n- **Scores:** confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The confidence level is high, given the simplicity of the statement.  \n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking the Scores and Content:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code snippet. The import line itself does not perform any malicious actions.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear.  \n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation (0.1, 0.2, 0.0) based on the use of wildcard import, which can be risky but not necessarily malicious. This is reasonable.  \n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable in their assessments.  \n- The use of wildcard import is correctly flagged as a potential concern but not inherently malicious.  \n- No report claims or implies actual malicious code or behavior beyond potential obscurity.  \n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the use of wildcard import, a slightly higher risk score (e.g., 0.2) is justified but not more.  \n\n### My own estimate:  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to wildcard import potential)  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippet is a standard import statement with no inherent malicious activity. The primary concern is the use of wildcard import, which warrants cautious review of the 'info' module but does not constitute a security threat by itself. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
