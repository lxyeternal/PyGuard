  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports analyze the same code: `from .info import *`.\n- The code is a relative import that imports all symbols from the 'info' module.\n- No actual malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior is visible in this line alone.\n- Use of wildcard import ('*') is generally discouraged because it can hide imported symbols, but it is not inherently malicious.\n- Without inspecting the 'info' module itself, we cannot determine if malicious code resides there.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct; straightforward import, no malicious activity.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Recognizes the wildcard import as potentially hiding malicious code but concludes no malicious activity from this line alone.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1 (due to wildcard import), confidence=0.6.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable; the risk score is low but acknowledges the potential danger of wildcard import.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, notes the risky nature of wildcard import but no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.3.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly higher risk score is justified, considering the import style. Confidence is low, which is appropriate given lack of evidence.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Repeats that this is a simple import with no apparent malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, confidence=0.8.\n- **Verdict:** Correct; high confidence in the benign nature of this line.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Correct; high confidence in safety.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence:** The code `from .info import *` is present and correct.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; all reports agree.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low, with some acknowledgment of the wildcard import's potential to hide malicious code.\n- **Confidence levels:** Appropriately assigned, reflecting the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Should stay low but consider that wildcard imports can be risky if the imported module is malicious. Since the module's content isn't visible, a small risk (0.1-0.2) is justified.\n- **Confidence:** High confidence (above 0.8) can be justified if the context is limited to this line alone, but since the 'info' module's contents are unknown, slightly lowering confidence to around 0.7-0.8 could be more cautious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** ~0.1 to 0.2 (due to wildcard import potential)\n- **Confidence:** 0.7-0.8\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign based on the provided snippet. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, though the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at zero, and the risk score should stay low, reflecting the potential danger of wildcard imports but not indicating actual malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** For a definitive security assessment, inspecting the 'info' module's contents is necessary. If it contains malicious code, the risk could be higher. However, based solely on this import statement, the current scoring is appropriate.",
