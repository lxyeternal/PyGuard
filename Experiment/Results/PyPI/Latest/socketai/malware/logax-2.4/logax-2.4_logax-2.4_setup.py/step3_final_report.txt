  "purpose": "A Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; package metadata fields; dependencies specified in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network activity or code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields are unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with no dynamic code, network activity, or malicious patterns. The only minor concern is missing author info, which does not impact security. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0 and obfuscated=0. Risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1), justified by missing author info but not indicating any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The package is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score is appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
