(2022)\n#\n# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n# You may obtain a copy of the License at\n#\n#     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n#\n# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n# limitations under the License.\n\nfrom streamlit_gsheets.gsheets_connection import GSheetsConnection  # noqa\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code contains only licensing comments and a single import statement.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or network activity is present.\n- The imported class `GSheetsConnection` is from an external module, likely used elsewhere in the project.\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1-5:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple import statement with licensing comments.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- No data flows, sinks, or potential vulnerabilities are present.\n- The reports correctly conclude that the code is benign and part of a larger project.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The reports are accurate: there are no malicious behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no active data flows.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning?**  \n  No. The analysis correctly identifies the benign nature of this code snippet.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid speculation and stick to observable facts.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity or code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code is only an import statement, the actual behavior and potential risks depend on how `GSheetsConnection` is used elsewhere.  \n- Without further context, there's no reason to assign higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code snippet is benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
