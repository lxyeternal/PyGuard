  "purpose": "The code imports a class GSheetsConnection from a module within the streamlit_gsheets package, likely for establishing a connection to Google Sheets.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing GSheetsConnection from streamlit_gsheets.gsheets_connection",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data leaks or system effects are evident",
  "flows": "N/A - only an import statement; no data flow or execution flow observable",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only an import statement with no additional logic, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a licensing comment and a single import statement. The import references a class that could potentially connect to Google Sheets, but no usage, credentials, or network activity is present in this snippet. The licensing comment is standard and does not introduce any malicious behavior. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with licensing comments, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project, but in its current form, it is benign.",
