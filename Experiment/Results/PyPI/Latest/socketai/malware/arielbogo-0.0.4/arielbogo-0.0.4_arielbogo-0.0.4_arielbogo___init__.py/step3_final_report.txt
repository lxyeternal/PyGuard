{
  "purpose": "This code snippet contains licensing comments and a single import statement for GSheetsConnection from the streamlit_gsheets module, likely used elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "The import statement from streamlit_gsheets.gsheets_connection, which may read or utilize external data or network resources when used in context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include the instantiation or use of GSheetsConnection that might connect to external services or handle sensitive data, but none are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this isolated code; the import alone does not execute any data or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and an import statement. There is no executable logic, data processing, or network activity visible. The import references a class that could facilitate Google Sheets interactions, but in this context, it is inert. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with licensing comments. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
