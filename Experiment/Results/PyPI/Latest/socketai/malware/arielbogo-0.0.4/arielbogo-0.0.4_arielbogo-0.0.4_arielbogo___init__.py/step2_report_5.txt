  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\n# Copyright (c) Streamlit Inc. (2018-2022) Snowflake Inc. (2022)\n#\n# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n# You may obtain a copy of the License at\n#\n#     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n#\n# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n# limitations under the License.\n\nfrom streamlit_gsheets.gsheets_connection import GSheetsConnection  # noqa\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is a simple import statement with licensing comments. No executable logic, no data handling, no secrets, and no network activity are visible.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected. The import is standard and appears to be part of a larger project.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Data flow or sink:** No data flows, no sinks, no external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** None. The code is straightforward.\n\n### Review of individual reports:\nAll five reports essentially state the same: the code is just an import statement with licensing comments, with no suspicious activity or security concerns. They all assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0, which seems appropriate.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. Since the code is only an import statement with licensing info, the malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores should all be zero.  \n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The class `GSheetsConnection` might be used elsewhere for connecting to Google Sheets, but this snippet alone doesn't reveal any malicious intent.\n- The import could be part of a malicious package if the package itself was compromised, but based solely on this code, there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (benign)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard import statement with licensing comments. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks in this snippet. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code snippet is safe and does not pose any security concerns.",
