{
  "purpose": "Import the GSheetsConnection class from the streamlit_gsheets.gsheets_connection module, likely for establishing a connection to Google Sheets.",
  "sources": "The import statement is the primary source of data reading, importing a class from an external module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are explicitly present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs within this code fragment; it only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a standard license header and a single import statement; no anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides licensing information, which is standard practice, followed by a single import statement importing a class from an external module. There are no inputs, no processing, no data manipulation, or untrusted data handling present. The import appears legitimate and typical for a module that would interface with Google Sheets via a third-party library.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign and appears to be part of a normal, well-structured project. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this fragment.",
