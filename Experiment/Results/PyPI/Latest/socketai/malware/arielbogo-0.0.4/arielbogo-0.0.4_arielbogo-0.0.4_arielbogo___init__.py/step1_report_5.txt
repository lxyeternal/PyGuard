  "purpose": "The code imports a class GSheetsConnection from a module within the streamlit_gsheets package, likely to facilitate connection and interaction with Google Sheets.",
  "sources": "The import statement from streamlit_gsheets.gsheets_connection import GSheetsConnection.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this code snippet; no untrusted data handling or sensitive operations are visible.",
  "flows": "Since the code only imports a class, there are no active data flows or source-to-sink paths demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns are present. The import appears standard and harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license header and a single import statement for a class from a module related to Google Sheets connections. No executable logic, data processing, or external communication is shown. The imported class may be used elsewhere in the project but in this snippet, it does not pose any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, serving only as an import statement with proper licensing information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
