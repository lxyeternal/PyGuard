  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports describe a code snippet consisting solely of licensing comments and a single import statement:\n     ```python\n     from streamlit_gsheets.gsheets_connection import GSheetsConnection\n     ```\n   - There is no executable logic, data processing, or network activity in the provided snippet.\n   - The import references a class that could facilitate Google Sheets connections, but in this isolated fragment, it is inert.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious Activity**:\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or code that could be exploited are visible.\n   - The code is standard for a module that might be used elsewhere, but in this form, it is benign.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Data Flows**:\n   - No data flows, sinks, or sources are observable in the snippet.\n   - The absence of runtime logic or external communication reduces risk significantly.\n\n4. **Score Justification**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: No obfuscation detected.\n   - **Malware Score (0)**: No malicious activity or intent evident.\n   - **Risk Score (0)**: Given the above, the overall security risk is negligible.\n\n5. **Critical Evaluation**:\n   - The reports are consistent: all identify the code as benign, with no suspicious activity.\n   - The assumption that importing a class from a module could be malicious is unfounded in this context, as import statements are standard and inert without subsequent usage.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The code snippet is a simple, benign import statement with licensing comments.\n   - No evidence supports any security concern or malicious intent.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature. No changes are necessary; the current scores are appropriate.",
