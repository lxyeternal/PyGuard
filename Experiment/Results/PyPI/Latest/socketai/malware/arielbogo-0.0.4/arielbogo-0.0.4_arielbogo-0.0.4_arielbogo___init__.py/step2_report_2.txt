  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple import statement with licensing comments.\n- No signs of data flow, execution, or malicious activity are present.\n- The import is from a module named `streamlit_gsheets.gsheets_connection`, which suggests functionality related to Google Sheets integration.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of only an import statement and licensing comments** — no code execution, data flow, or external communication.\n- **No evidence of malicious behavior**.\n- **No obfuscation or anomalies**.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **No logical errors or flaws** in the reports; they are consistent and accurate based on the code snippet provided.\n- **No over- or under-scoring** appears necessary; all reports assign a security risk of 0 and malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports, which is correct given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, appropriate as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** 0, aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely an import statement with licensing comments, and no other activity, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The reports correctly do not attribute any risk or malware potential.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent from an import statement alone.\n- No false positives or overinterpretations are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the benign nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent and reasonable. The code is harmless, and the scoring aligns with the observed content. No further action or adjustment is necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is the appropriate assessment given the provided code snippet and reports.",
