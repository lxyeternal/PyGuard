  "purpose": "Detect and evaluate potential malicious behavior in the setup script, specifically the external network request during import.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.run call executing 'curl' to an external webhook URL during module import.",
  "sinks": "External network communication that could lead to data exfiltration, remote control, or tracking.",
  "flows": "Code execution flows from import to subprocess.run, contacting the external URL immediately upon module load.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of an external network request during package setup, which is unusual and suspicious; no obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a straightforward subprocess call to 'curl' with a hardcoded URL during import, which is highly unusual for a setup script and suggests potential malicious intent. The code is otherwise standard for package configuration. The external request could be used for data exfiltration, command-and-control, or tracking. The scores assigned in the reports (confidence ~0.8-0.9, malware 0.6-0.8, security risk 0.75-0.85) are justified, but given the high suspicion, they should be slightly increased. The external contact during setup is a red flag indicating high risk and malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior with a high likelihood of malicious intent due to the external network request during package setup. The scores should be adjusted upward to reflect the severity, with malware score at 0.8 and security risk at 0.9. It warrants further investigation or rejection in security-sensitive contexts.",
