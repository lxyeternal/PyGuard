  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The report correctly describes the code's functionality—interacting with Google Sheets via gspread, pandas, and duckdb, with caching and data manipulation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Use of duckdb is standard for in-memory SQL querying.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment of legitimacy and safety is consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Malware score: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (due to general data handling, but minimal).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on restrictions on public sheets (exceptions raised for write operations). Correctly notes the use of exceptions to prevent modifications.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no backdoors, no malicious URL manipulations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is legitimate, with appropriate access restrictions.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Malware score: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The code supports both public and service account access, with standard data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. Proper error handling and restrictions are in place.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The implementation is standard and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Malware score: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to above, with standard data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The use of duckdb is typical for SQL querying.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Malware score: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The code is a typical client for Google Sheets, with standard data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. Restrictions on public sheets are correctly implemented.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears safe and standard.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Malware score: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0.1 due to data handling and external API interactions, but nothing indicating a serious security risk.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- Network activity appears standard (Google Sheets API, CSV download, pandas, duckdb).\n- Restrictions on public spreadsheet modifications are correctly implemented.\n- Use of caching and exception handling is appropriate.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for interacting with Google Sheets, with no evident security risks or malicious behavior.",
