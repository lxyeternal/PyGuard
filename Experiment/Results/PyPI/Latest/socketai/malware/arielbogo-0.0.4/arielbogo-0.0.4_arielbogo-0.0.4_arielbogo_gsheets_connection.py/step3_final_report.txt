  "purpose": "Client classes for interacting with Google Sheets via gspread, pandas, and duckdb, supporting read, query, create, update, and clear operations with caching and access restrictions.",
  "sources": "Secrets dictionary for credentials, URL parsing for public sheets, method parameters for spreadsheet and worksheet identifiers, external API calls (gspread, pandas, duckdb).",
  "sinks": "DataFrame outputs from read/query methods, data written into sheets via set_with_dataframe, exceptions raised for restricted operations.",
  "flows": "Secrets and parameters flow into client initialization, URL validation and parsing lead to data download or API calls, data flows into dataframes and back into sheets, SQL queries executed on in-memory duckdb database.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious URL manipulations or network activity, proper exception handling for access restrictions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Google Sheets API interactions with appropriate access controls, data handling, and caching. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected. Use of well-known libraries and standard practices indicates a legitimate, safe implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured client for Google Sheets with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical external API interactions. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
