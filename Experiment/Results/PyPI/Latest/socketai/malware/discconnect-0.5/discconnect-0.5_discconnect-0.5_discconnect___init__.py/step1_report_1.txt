  "purpose": "This code appears to be a typical Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, file reads, and network requests (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmissions, file writes, subprocess executions, or sensitive data exposures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment, files) to sinks (network, files, subprocesses).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual code patterns or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard libraries and patterns. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. All dependencies and functions appear legitimate. No obfuscated or dynamically generated code was found. The code structure is clean, with no hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign script performing standard operations, with no suspicious behaviors or anomalies identified.",
