  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, network activity indicators, dynamic execution points (eval/exec), hardcoded strings or URLs.",
  "sinks": "Data leaks via environment variables or network, file modifications, system commands, or dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into eval/exec or network calls, potentially leading to malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (eval/exec, obfuscated variable names), lack of comments, suspicious URLs or strings, dynamic code execution, absence of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits varying levels of obfuscation and dynamic execution features. Reports 1, 4, and 5 show no code or benign code with low suspicion. Report 2 shows some opacity and potential for hidden behavior, warranting cautious suspicion; the malware score could be slightly reduced from 0.2 to 0.1. Report 3 contains obfuscated code with eval/exec and suspicious strings, justifying higher obfuscation (0.7) and a slightly increased malware score (from 0.3 to 0.4) due to the potential for malicious intent. No concrete malicious payloads are confirmed, but features suggest possible misuse. Scores are consistent with the described features, with adjustments made to better reflect suspicion levels.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign or low risk, with Report 3 showing notable obfuscation and dynamic features that elevate suspicion. Adjusted malware score for Report 2 to 0.1 and confirmed scores for others are appropriate. Overall, the code exhibits no confirmed malicious activity but warrants cautious monitoring where obfuscation and dynamic execution are present.",
