  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign or low risk, with Report 3 showing notable obfuscation and dynamic features that elevate suspicion. Adjusted malware score for Report 2 to 0.1 and confirmed scores for others are appropriate. Overall, the code exhibits no confirmed malicious activity but warrants cautious monitoring where obfuscation and dynamic execution are present."
