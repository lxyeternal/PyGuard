{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.Request and urllib.request.urlopen for fetching external data; environment variable 'LOCALAPPDATA' for determining download path.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded file via ctypes.windll.shell32.ShellExecuteW, which runs the downloaded executable.",
  "flows": "Code constructs a URL request, downloads a file to a local directory, then executes that file immediately after download.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and automatically executing a remote file during package installation; hardcoded URL pointing to an external server; execution is only supported on Windows systems; no user confirmation.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'install' command to perform additional actions post-installation. It downloads a file from a remote URL and executes it automatically, which is suspicious behavior. The URL points to an external resource that could host malicious payloads. The process leverages environment variables and system calls to execute the downloaded file silently on Windows, indicating intent to run potentially malicious code without user interaction. No security checks, validation, or signature verification are performed on the downloaded file. The code does not contain obfuscated elements, but its behavior is highly suspicious due to silent download and execution of external content during installation.",
  "conclusion": "This package includes potentially malicious behavior by automatically downloading and executing an external executable during installation. It poses a significant security risk, especially since there is no validation or user consent. The code demonstrates clear malicious intent, making the package unsafe to use.",
