  "purpose": "A Java code linter that checks class declarations, method naming, and variable naming conventions.",
  "sources": "Input code string provided to the lint method; reading lines of code for pattern matching.",
  "sinks": "Appending to self.errors list when pattern mismatches are found.",
  "flows": "Code lines are analyzed line-by-line; pattern matching results determine error messages added to self.errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behavior observed; the code performs straightforward pattern checks without any data exfiltration or system modification actions.",
  "analysis": "The script uses regular expressions to verify Java code syntax conventions related to class names, method names, and variable names. It scans each line for pattern mismatches and logs errors accordingly. The code does not contain any network activity, system modifications, or external data handling. The code is a standard static analysis tool focused on code style enforcement. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions are simple and explicitly geared toward syntax validation, with no malicious intent or harmful effects.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign Java linter for coding style checks. It does not contain malware or security risks, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
