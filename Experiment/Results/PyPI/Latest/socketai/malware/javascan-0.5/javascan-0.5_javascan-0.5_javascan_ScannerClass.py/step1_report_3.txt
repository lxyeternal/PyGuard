  "purpose": "A Java code linter designed to enforce naming conventions and proper class declaration syntax.",
  "sources": "Reads code input as a string and processes line-by-line to identify class declarations, method definitions, and variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "Errors are collected and stored; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input code is split into lines; regex checks flow from source (code lines) to validation (regex matching), then to error logging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code performs straightforward pattern matching for style enforcement.",
  "analysis": "The code performs pattern matching to verify class names start with uppercase, method names follow camelCase, and variables follow camelCase. No dynamic execution, network access, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The regex checks are standard and not obfuscated. No external libraries or suspicious imports are used. The logic is simple and solely for style enforcement, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign style linter for Java code, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply enforces coding standards via regex checks.",
