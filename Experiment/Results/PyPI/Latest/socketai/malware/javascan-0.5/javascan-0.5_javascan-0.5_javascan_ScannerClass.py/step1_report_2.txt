  "purpose": "A Java code linter that checks for proper class declaration, method naming, and variable naming conventions.",
  "sources": "Reads input Java code as a string, splits it into lines for analysis.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code primarily reads and analyzes code text without executing or processing untrusted input beyond pattern matching.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex patterns for code validation; no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and focused on style checking.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static code linter for Java code that performs style checks for class, method, and variable naming conventions using regex. It processes input code as a string, examines each line for pattern matches, and records errors accordingly. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious instructions are present. The logic is purely for style enforcement and does not manipulate or execute untrusted data beyond pattern matching.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static analysis tool aimed at enforcing coding style conventions in Java code. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely performs pattern-based validation without side effects or unsafe operations.",
