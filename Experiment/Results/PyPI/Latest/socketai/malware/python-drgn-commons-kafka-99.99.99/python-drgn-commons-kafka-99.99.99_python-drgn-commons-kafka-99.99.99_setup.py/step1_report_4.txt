  "purpose": "This code customizes the installation process of a Python package to collect system information and send it to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "os.popen calls for 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'whoami', 'hostname'; os.system call for sending data via curl to Slack webhook.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a curl command that posts data to an external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system commands (sources) flows into the curl command (sink) via string formatting, resulting in an HTTP POST request to an external service.",
  "anomalies": "The script gathers detailed system info and transmits it unconditionally to an external webhook during installation, which is unusual behavior. The URL appears hardcoded and is a Slack webhook, potentially used for exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during the install process, executes system commands to gather OS-specific info, hostname, username, and public IP address. It then constructs a detailed message including filename, hostname, user, public IP, current directory, OS info, and IP info. This message is sent via a curl command to a specified Slack webhook URL. The commands used reveal sensitive system information and are executed without any validation or user consent. The data flow from system info collection to external HTTP POST is direct and unencrypted, indicating potential for malicious data exfiltration. The hardcoded webhook URL further suggests this may be intended for covert data collection, especially since it occurs automatically during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting detailed system information and transmitting it to an external server without user consent. The unprompted data exfiltration during installation is suspicious and indicates a potential backdoor or tracking mechanism. Overall, the script's actions are malicious, and the package should not be trusted.",
