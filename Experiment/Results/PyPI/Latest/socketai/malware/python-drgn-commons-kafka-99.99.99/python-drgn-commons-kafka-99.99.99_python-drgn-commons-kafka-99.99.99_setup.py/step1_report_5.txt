  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process of a Python package to gather system information and send it to a specified Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Input sources include system commands such as 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'whoami', and 'hostname'. Data is read from these commands to collect system info, user info, and network details.",
  "sinks": "The untrusted data (collected info) is sent via an HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook URL using 'os.system'. The data is embedded into a JSON payload directly in the command line.",
  "flows": "System information obtained from system commands flows into the 'os.system' call, where it is interpolated into a curl command that transmits the data to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes multiple system commands to collect sensitive system information, including potentially sensitive details like hostname, user, OS info, and IP configuration. It then transmits this info externally without user consent or encryption. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which is suspicious, and the use of 'os.popen' and 'os.system' for data collection and transmission could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, during installation, gathers detailed system info based on the platform. It uses 'popen' to execute system commands and retrieve data, which is then printed and sent to a remote webhook via 'curl' in an 'os.system' call. The data collected includes hostname, current user, OS details, network configuration, and the public IP. All this information is sent to a Slack webhook URL, which is hardcoded into the script. The collection and transmission of sensitive system information to an external service without clear user consent constitute a privacy risk. The code employs multiple system commands to gather info, which could be misused for reconnaissance or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects extensive system information and transmits it externally to a Slack webhook without user consent or encryption. The hardcoded webhook URL and use of system commands to gather potentially sensitive info suggest malicious or at least privacy-invasive behavior. The behavior aligns with malicious data exfiltration and reconnaissance tactics. It should be considered high risk.",
