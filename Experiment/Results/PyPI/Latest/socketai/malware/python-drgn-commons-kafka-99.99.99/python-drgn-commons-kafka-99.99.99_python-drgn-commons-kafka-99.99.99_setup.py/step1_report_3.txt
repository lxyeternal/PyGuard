  "purpose": "Custom installation process that gathers system information and reports it to a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls for 'uname', 'ifconfig', 'curl', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'whoami', 'hostname'; os.system() call to send data via curl to Slack.",
  "sinks": "os.popen() and os.system() executing system commands; the curl command in os.system() sending data to an external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info collected via os.popen() calls flows into the string formatting in os.system() which then transmits the data to the Slack webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional collection of system information on every install without user consent; sensitive info such as hostname, current directory, user identity, and system configuration are transmitted externally; use of a hardcoded Slack webhook URL; use of os.popen() and os.system() for executing shell commands, which can be risky if inputs are manipulated (though inputs here are static).",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during installation, collects various system details depending on the platform. It then sends this information to a specified Slack webhook URL via an HTTP POST request. The information collected includes system configuration, user info, hostname, current directory, and network details. The data transmission occurs automatically during each package install without explicit user consent or notification, and the webhook URL is hardcoded. The use of shell commands and network transmission suggests potential for privacy violations or malicious data exfiltration. No code injection or reverse shells are present, but the collection and external transmission of system information could be considered malicious if done without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates detailed system information to an external service during package installation, which is a malicious behavior in the context of supply chain security and privacy. This behavior is likely intended for tracking or unauthorized data collection purposes. There are no clear signs of traditional malware such as code damaging or system control mechanisms, but the privacy invasion and unconsented data exfiltration classify this as malicious behavior.",
