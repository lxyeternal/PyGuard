{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (OS details, hostname, user, IP addresses, current directory) during package installation and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL without user consent, potentially for malicious tracking or privacy invasion.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls for 'uname -a', 'systeminfo', 'ifconfig', 'ipconfig', 'whoami', 'hostname', 'curl ifconfig.me'; os.getcwd() for current directory.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing curl command to send JSON payload to external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered via os.popen() and os.getcwd(), then assembled into a JSON string embedded in a curl command executed by os.system(), which transmits the data externally.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data collection and exfiltration during package install without user notification; use of hardcoded webhook URL; no validation or encryption; straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs system info collection via platform-specific commands, constructs a JSON payload, and sends it to an external URL during installation. It does so unconditionally, with no user consent or validation. The behavior is privacy-invasive and resembles covert data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or destructive payloads. The data transmission to a hardcoded webhook is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially in supply chain contexts. The malware score is high due to the exfiltration nature, and the security risk score is also high. The code's intent appears malicious, acting as a backdoor or privacy violation mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The code is performing covert, unconsented collection and transmission of sensitive system information during package installation, constituting a serious security and privacy concern. It should be classified as malicious or compromised, with high malware and risk scores justified by its exfiltration behavior.",
