  "purpose": "Custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls to execute system commands ('uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'whoami', 'hostname'), os.getcwd() to get current directory.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing a curl command to send data over the network to a Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System commands' outputs (system info, IPs, user info) are collected via os.popen() and passed as formatted data to os.system() which sends an HTTP POST request to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, user identity, network configurations, and sends it unencrypted to an external URL. It uses hardcoded URL for Slack webhook. No clear user consent or safeguards are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code hooks into the installation process of a package, then gathers detailed system information based on OS type. It retrieves system configuration, IP addresses, user info, and hostname via command-line calls. It then constructs a JSON payload containing these details and sends it via a curl command to an external Slack webhook URL, potentially leaking sensitive information. No validation, encryption, or anonymization is performed. This behavior could be malicious, aiming to exfiltrate system data during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The script secretly collects system details and transmits them to an external service without user consent. This behavior resembles data exfiltration and could be malicious. The code does not contain typical obfuscation but performs suspicious data collection and transmission actions.",
