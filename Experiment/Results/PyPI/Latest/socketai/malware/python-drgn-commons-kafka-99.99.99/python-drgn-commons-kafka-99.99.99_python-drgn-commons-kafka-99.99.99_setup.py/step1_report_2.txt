  "purpose": "Custom installation script that collects system information and posts it to a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "System commands executed via os.popen and os.system, including 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'whoami', 'hostname', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist'.",
  "sinks": "The Slack webhook URL in os.system call receiving a POST request with collected system data embedded in the payload.",
  "flows": "System commands gather data -> data assigned to variables -> variables interpolated into JSON payload -> payload sent via curl to Slack webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of system commands to gather potentially sensitive system info; hardcoded Slack webhook URL, which could lead to data exfiltration if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, executes various system commands based on the platform to gather system details such as OS info, current directory, IP addresses, username, hostname, and process list. It then constructs a JSON message including this info and sends it via a curl POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. No input validation or environment checks are performed, and the webhook URL is hardcoded. The data collection occurs every time the package is installed, potentially leaking system information to an external service. The code does not appear to perform malicious actions beyond data collection and transmission, but the hardcoded URL and unprotected info gathering represent a privacy concern and potential data exfiltration vector.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects detailed system information and transmits it to an external Slack webhook during package installation. Although it does not perform destructive actions or concealment, the unsolicited data exfiltration and hardcoded webhook URL are security and privacy concerns. The behavior suggests a privacy violation rather than malicious sabotage, but it could be exploited for malicious purposes if the webhook URL is controlled by an attacker.",
