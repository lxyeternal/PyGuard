  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for use in a larger Python application, likely related to task execution or environment validation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their __init__ methods; no external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code consists solely of class declarations and exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains straightforward exception class definitions with no data input, external data reading, or suspicious behavior. The comments suggest future refactoring or modularization but do not indicate malicious intent. There are no indications of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior. The classes are standard custom exceptions used for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is simple, clean, and focused on exception definitions. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. It appears safe and intended solely for error handling within a larger application.",
