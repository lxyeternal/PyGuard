  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the underlying code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Content:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or any malicious payloads.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no external data handling, I/O, or complex logic.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears well-structured and typical for defining custom exceptions.\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the logic or implementation.\n   - The comments suggest possible future refactoring but do not impact security.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign assessment.\n   - The reasoning in each report is consistent and sound.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly challenge any assumptions of malicious intent, clarifying that these are just exception classes.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities that are based on assumptions; the analysis is cautious and accurate.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is purely definitional, with no operational or security-sensitive components.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and aligned with the content.\n   - No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I concur with the assessments.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n- The confidence level remains at **1**, as the analysis is definitive.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or security-sensitive content.\n- The scores and reasoning in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
