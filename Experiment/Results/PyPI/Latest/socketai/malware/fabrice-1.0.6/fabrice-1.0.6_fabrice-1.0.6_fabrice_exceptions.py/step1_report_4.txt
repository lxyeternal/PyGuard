  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to task management and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no dynamic code execution, external input handling, or data processing. It includes standard exception classes with minimal logic, primarily constructors and docstrings. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or network activity are present. The classes are straightforward and serve as part of a larger application context, likely related to task management or environment validation in a fabric deployment setting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as exception class definitions without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
