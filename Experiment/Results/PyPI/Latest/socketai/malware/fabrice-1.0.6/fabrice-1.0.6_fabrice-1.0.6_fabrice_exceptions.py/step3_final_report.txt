  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with no external data input or output; no data flows.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow; only class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three exception classes with minimal logic, no external interactions, and no obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. Confidence is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as exception definitions. There are no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The current scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
