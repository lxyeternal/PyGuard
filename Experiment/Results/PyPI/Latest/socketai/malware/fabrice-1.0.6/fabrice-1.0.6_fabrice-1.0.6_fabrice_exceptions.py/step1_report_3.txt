  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application, possibly related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted sources or potential vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with no data input, external communication, or complex logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. The comments suggest the classes are part of a larger framework but do not exhibit any malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. It appears to be standard application code intended for error handling.",
