{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application, likely related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; exception classes are defined without external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; this code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward and standard; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no data processing, network, or security-sensitive operations. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The classes are typical and well-structured, intended for error handling, and do not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of exception class definitions for managing errors in a larger application. There are no signs of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation.",
