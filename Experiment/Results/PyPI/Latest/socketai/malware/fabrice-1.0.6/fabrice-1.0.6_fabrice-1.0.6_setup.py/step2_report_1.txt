  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the use of `exec()` on the `_version.py` file as a potential security concern. This is a common pattern in setup scripts but can be risky if the version file is compromised.\n- No reports indicate actual malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with dynamic configuration based on environment variables and directory checks.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.2-0.3), reflecting the concern about `exec()` but acknowledging the overall benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Consistency:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The `exec()` on `_version.py` is the only notable concern. All reports agree on this point.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors or mistakes in logic are identified beyond the `exec()` usage, which is a known pattern but not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** The scores are reasonable. The malware score is 0, consistent with no malicious activity. The security risk scores are slightly above zero, which is appropriate given the `exec()` concern.\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports; no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2-0.3), reflecting the `exec()` usage without evidence of malicious intent.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The reports correctly identify the main security concern and assign appropriate scores.\n- No adjustments needed for the scores; they are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** ~0.2 — the use of `exec()` introduces a minor security concern but not a significant threat.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a typical, well-structured setup script with a minor security concern due to the use of `exec()` to read version info. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and their scoring reflects the actual security posture of the code. The main point of caution is the `exec()` on `_version.py`, which should be validated or replaced with safer alternatives (e.g., importing or parsing). However, as it stands, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
