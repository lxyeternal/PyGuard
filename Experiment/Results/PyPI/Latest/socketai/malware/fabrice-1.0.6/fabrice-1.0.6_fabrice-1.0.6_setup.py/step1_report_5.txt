  "purpose": "Configure and set up the packaging for a Python project named 'fabrice' with optional support for 'fabric' and 'fabric2' directories, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get, os.path.abspath, os.path.dirname, os.path.isdir, open('README.rst'), open(os.path.join(package_name, '_version.py'))",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup, exec(fp.read()), open('README.rst')",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences package name; directory checks influence package selection; reading _version.py to determine version; reading README for long_description; setup configuration is built from these variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The code is straightforward package setup code, with standard practices for version reading and package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing standard modules and reads an environment variable to decide package variant. It performs directory existence checks to determine package variant. It reads version information from a file using exec, which is a typical pattern in setup scripts. The long_description is built from a README file. Dependencies and package metadata are specified explicitly. The setup function uses these parameters to configure packaging. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious data flows. All data reads are from local files or environment variables, and no untrusted input is processed directly. The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It reads configuration data from local files and environment variables to set up the package. There are no suspicious data flows, backdoors, or malware indicators.",
