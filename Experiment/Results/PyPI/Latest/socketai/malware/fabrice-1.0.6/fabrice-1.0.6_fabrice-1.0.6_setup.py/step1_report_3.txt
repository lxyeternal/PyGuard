  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package for distribution, including dependencies, versioning, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2), filesystem (checking directories and reading files), open() calls (reading README and version file).",
  "sinks": "exec() call on the _version.py content, file reads for README and version, and setting up package metadata.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks influence package naming; reading version info from file; executing content of _version.py; reading README; setup function uses these values to configure package.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on contents of _version.py without validation could be risky if _version.py contains malicious code. Reading files directly and executing their contents can be dangerous if files are compromised. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment checks, filesystem checks, and reads files to configure package setup. The use of exec() to evaluate _version.py is potentially risky, as it can execute malicious code if the file is tampered with. However, this is a common pattern in setup scripts for version extraction. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is evident. All third-party libraries are standard for setup scripts. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with minimal security risks. The main concern is the use of exec() on version files, which could be exploited if the version file is maliciously modified. Otherwise, no malicious behavior or malicious code is detected.",
