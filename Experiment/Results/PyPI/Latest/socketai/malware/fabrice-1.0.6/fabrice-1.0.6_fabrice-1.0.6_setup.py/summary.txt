  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with a minor security concern due to the use of exec() on a version file. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the overall security posture is low risk. To enhance security, consider replacing exec() with safer methods such as importing the version module directly or parsing the version string without execution."
