  "purpose": "Configure and set up the Python package 'fabrice' with optional v2 support, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', filesystem checks for directories 'fabric2' and 'fabric', reading '_version.py', and 'README.rst' file.",
  "sinks": "Executing code from '_version.py' via exec(), reading 'README.rst' content, and setting up package configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and filesystem checks influence package name and binary; reading '_version.py' provides version info; reading 'README.rst' supplies long description; setup() configures package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute contents of '_version.py' without sanitization. No other suspicious or malicious code detected; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package configuration with dynamic naming based on environment variables and directory checks. It uses exec() to read version info from a local file, which could be risky if the file contents are malicious. However, this is a common pattern in setup scripts. Files read ('_version.py', 'README.rst') are typical for setup scripts. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious behaviors are present. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are detected. Overall, the script appears standard for a Python package setup, with a potential minor concern about exec() usage for version reading.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with dynamic configuration based on environment and filesystem. It uses exec() to load version info, which is common but could be risky if the file is malicious. No malware or malicious intent detected. Security risk is minimal.",
