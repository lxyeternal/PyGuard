The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the overall security posture is low risk. To enhance security, consider replacing exec() with safer methods such as importing the version module directly or parsing the version string without execution."

The only minor security consideration is the hardcoded sudo password, which is acceptable in controlled testing environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.1-0.2, consistent with the minimal risk posed by the testing context."
