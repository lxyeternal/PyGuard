  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is just import statements in a __init__.py file, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is sound; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes the code as a straightforward module exposer.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard import pattern, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are consistent.\n- **Note:** The comment `# flake8: noqa` is benign here, merely disabling linting.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns; the report's reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others; standard import statements with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1—slightly above zero, but still very low.\n- **Justification:** No dynamic code, no external data handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk score could be lowered to 0, as there's no evidence of security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely import statements, with no malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- The risk scores are very low; however, in Report 5, a risk of 0.1 might be slightly overestimating given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk score:** For Reports 1-4, 0 is justified. For Report 5, it should be adjusted down to 0, as there's no indication of security issues.\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**This aligns with the evidence: the code is standard, safe, and not malicious.**",
