{
  "purpose": "Import statements for various modules and classes within a Python package, likely to provide package functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules such as ._version, .connection, .runners, .group, .tasks, and .executor.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external effects; purely import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible; code only imports internal modules and classes.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any executable logic, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements to internal modules of a package. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modification. All imports are from relative internal modules, which is standard for Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The code's purpose appears to be to make internal classes and functions available for external use. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module import statement block, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is typical for package initialization files. The risk level is very low.",
