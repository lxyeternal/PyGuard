      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant security concern. The scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate, but a higher malware and risk score better reflect the danger of untrusted code execution during installation."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behavior characteristic of covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive intent. While it lacks destructive payloads, its purpose aligns with malware-like activity. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is significant. The minimal encoding does not constitute obfuscation, so the obfuscation score remains low."
