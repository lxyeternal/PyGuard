  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to external URLs encoded in base64, potentially for tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading network interface details, random.randint() for generating a number, and the URLs containing network requests.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending data to external domains, including encoded MAC addresses and other system info in URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) collected and encoded; then sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs; no user input is directly used, but system info is transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of multiple suspicious external domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') that may be used for data exfiltration or command & control; encoding MAC addresses in base64 and transmitting over HTTP. The URLs appear to be non-standard and possibly malicious. No explicit data validation or security measures around data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system information such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses via system-specific commands. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, potentially obfuscating raw data. The code constructs URLs pointing to external domains and sends system info via HTTP GET requests without encryption or authentication. The external URLs are suspicious, possibly used for data collection or malicious tracking. The code does not include any malicious payload execution or backdoor behavior but facilitates data exfiltration. It appears designed to stealthily collect and transmit system identifiers, which could be used maliciously. No signs of code injection, code obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present, but the data collection and transmission pattern are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be collecting system information and transmitting it to external domains, likely for tracking, reconnaissance, or data exfiltration purposes. The use of suspicious URLs and encoding MAC addresses suggests malicious intent or at least malicious potential. While no payload execution is observed, the behavior aligns with covert data collection tactics.",
