  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it encoded to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current working directory.",
  "sinks": "Constructed URLs are accessed via urllib.request.urlopen, sending data to external servers.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered, encoded in base64, included as URL parameters, and sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domains (oast-cn, oast.fun) associated with security testing or malicious activities. Encoding MAC addresses and transmitting without user consent may indicate data exfiltration. No user input validation or authentication observed. The URL patterns suggest data collection for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system-specific identifiers such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. MAC addresses are encoded in base64 and sent as URL parameters to three external domains. The code uses platform-specific commands to retrieve MAC addresses, which could be exploited to fingerprint devices. The URLs appear suspicious and potentially malicious, as they are custom domains often used for command and control, testing, or data exfiltration. The data flow involves gathering device info and transmitting it over HTTP GET requests, which can be exploited for unauthorized data collection. There are no obvious signs of malicious code execution beyond data collection, but the presence of these domains and the method of data transmission suggest malicious intent or at least malicious utility, especially if deployed without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for covertly collecting device information and sending it to external servers. While it does not perform destructive actions or malicious code execution, its data collection and transmission pattern, combined with suspicious domains, pose security risks. It should be reviewed further for intent and legitimacy, but current analysis indicates potential malicious behavior.",
