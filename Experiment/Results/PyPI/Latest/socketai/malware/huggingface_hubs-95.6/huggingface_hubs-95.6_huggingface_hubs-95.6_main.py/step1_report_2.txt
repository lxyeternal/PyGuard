  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple external URLs encoded in Base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network interfaces, base64.b64encode() encoding MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending HTTP GET requests with system data as URL parameters to external domains.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) is collected, encoded, and appended as URL parameters, then sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain names, including one with a known malicious or malicious-sounding domain, possibly for data exfiltration. Data (MAC addresses) are base64-encoded before transmission, potentially obfuscating content. The code silently ignores exceptions during network requests.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system-specific data such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses from system network interfaces across Windows, Linux, and macOS. It then encodes the MAC addresses using base64. The data is sent via HTTP GET requests to three specified URLs, which appear suspicious due to their domain names and structure, suggesting potential malicious intent like data exfiltration. The code does not process or verify responses, and exceptions are silently caught, preventing detection of errors or malicious activity. The use of base64 encoding may be to obscure the data being transmitted. No user input is involved, and the network activity is directed toward external servers without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects and transmits system information to external URLs, possibly for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. The suspicious domain names, silent error handling, and encoding of system data indicate malicious behavior with high confidence. It does not contain obfuscation beyond encoding and appears intentionally designed to send system identifiers to remote servers covertly.",
