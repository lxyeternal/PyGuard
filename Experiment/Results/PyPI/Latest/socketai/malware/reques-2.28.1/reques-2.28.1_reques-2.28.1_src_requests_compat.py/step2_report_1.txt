  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a typical compatibility layer for the `requests` library, managing imports across Python 2 and 3.\n   - It performs conditional imports, handles import errors gracefully, and sets up version flags.\n   - It includes optional imports like `simplejson` and character detection libraries (`chardet`, `charset_normalizer`).\n   - No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network operations are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The code serves a standard purpose: ensuring compatibility across Python versions.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports describe the code as standard, benign, and typical for compatibility purposes.\n   - No suspicious logic, data leaks, or malicious behavior is identified.\n   - The analysis in each report aligns with the code's purpose and implementation.\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 reflects the lack of security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The only possible concern might be the dynamic import of optional libraries, but this is a common pattern and not malicious.\n   - No evidence suggests that these imports are used maliciously or that the code could be exploited.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a benign compatibility utility.\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n   - No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, well-understood compatibility layer with no security concerns.",
