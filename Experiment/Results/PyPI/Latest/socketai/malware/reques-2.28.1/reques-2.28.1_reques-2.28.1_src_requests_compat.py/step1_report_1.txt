  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, particularly for the requests library.",
  "sources": "import statements (importlib, sys, simplejson, json, collections, http, io, urllib)",
  "sinks": "None observed; no use of untrusted input processing or data leaks",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; standard compatibility code",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical compatibility layer managing imports and version differences. It conditionally imports modules, handles import errors gracefully, and sets up compatibility aliases. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All imports and functions serve standard purposes for backward compatibility. The code avoids executing untrusted data or performing insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign compatibility module without malicious intent or security risks.",
