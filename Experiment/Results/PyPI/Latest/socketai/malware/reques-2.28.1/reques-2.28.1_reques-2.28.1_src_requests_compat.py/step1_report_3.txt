{
  "purpose": "This module handles import compatibility and character detection for the requests library, providing backward compatibility for Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', and optional import of 'simplejson'.",
  "sinks": "Imports from standard modules; no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports from external modules to internal variables; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation observed. The dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' is standard for character detection, and optional 'simplejson' import is common.",
  "analysis": "The code performs compatibility checks for Python 2 and 3, attempts to import optional modules like 'simplejson' and character detection libraries, and defines some type aliases. All operations involve standard library imports and straightforward conditional logic. No user input handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing present. The code appears to be boilerplate compatibility and utility code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard compatibility and utility code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manages imports and type definitions, following common practices.",
