{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility handling for Python 2 and 3, managing imports and version detection for the requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version info checks, conditional imports of optional modules (simplejson, chardet, charset_normalizer).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only performs safe import operations and variable assignments.",
  "flows": "Import attempts and exception handling flow into version flags and optional dependency assignments; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with redundant 'str = str' assignment but no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, performing conditional imports and setting version flags. It handles optional dependencies gracefully without executing untrusted code or network operations. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present. The import patterns and variable assignments are typical for such utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a compatibility purpose without security risks or malicious intent. All signals indicate a safe, standard implementation.",
