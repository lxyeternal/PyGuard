{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility support for different Python versions and imports various utility functions and modules used elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (importlib, sys, json, collections, http, io, urllib), and internal functions like _resolve_char_detection().",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data sources or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily initializes imports and configuration variables without processing external input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The function _resolve_char_detection() conditionally imports 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' without any obfuscation. Variable assignments are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly setup and compatibility support for different Python versions and JSON libraries. It performs safe import operations, assigns version flags, and defines basic data types. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The imports are standard and well-understood, with no suspicious logic or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and utility module without any malicious intent or security risks. It is purely for environment setup and library imports, with no indicators of malware or malicious behavior.",
