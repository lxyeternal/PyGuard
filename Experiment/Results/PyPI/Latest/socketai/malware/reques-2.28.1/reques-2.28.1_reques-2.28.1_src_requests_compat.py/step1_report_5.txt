{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling different Python versions and character detection libraries, primarily for backwards compatibility in requests.",
  "sources": "Import statements, particularly dynamic imports for 'chardet' and 'simplejson', and version info from sys.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported modules and dynamic imports; no direct data sinks or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Import and conditional module import flows, with no untrusted data flow or external network/data interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. The dynamic import of optional libraries is standard practice for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version checks, attempts to import optional libraries ('chardet' and 'simplejson') with exception handling, and defines compatibility variables. The use of dynamic imports is typical for handling optional dependencies and does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as obfuscation, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The code focuses on compatibility and setup, with no evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and import setup module, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is typical of a library maintaining backward compatibility across Python versions.",
