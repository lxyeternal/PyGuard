{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and resolves character detection libraries.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, conditional import resolution, and dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code primarily sets up compatibility and import resolution; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' is standard for compatibility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses on backward compatibility, dynamic library resolution, and import statements. It attempts to import optional libraries ('simplejson', 'chardet', 'charset_normalizer') and fallback to standard modules if unavailable. It defines some utility variables for Python version detection and standardizes data types. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. All operations are standard and well within typical compatibility handling routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward compatibility utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It primarily manages imports and defines some compatibility variables without executing any harmful actions.",
