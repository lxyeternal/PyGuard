  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by importing specific modules ('urllib3', 'idna', and optionally 'chardet') and aliasing them under the 'requests.packages' namespace through dynamic sys.modules manipulation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet'; access to sys.modules for aliasing modules.",
  "sinks": "sys.modules entries being overwritten or aliased under 'requests.packages' namespace.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are assigned to sys.modules entries; these entries are then aliased under 'requests.packages' namespace, enabling legacy import paths.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional use of dynamic sys.modules manipulation for compatibility; no malicious code or external data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific packages and manipulates sys.modules to alias these modules under a different namespace for backward compatibility. It does not perform any network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The technique, while unusual, is a known pattern for legacy support and not inherently malicious. No suspicious signals such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The manipulation could be exploited if malicious modules are inserted beforehand, but in this context, it appears benign. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is detected. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the unconventional pattern that could be misused but is not malicious here.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a compatibility shim, employing dynamic module aliasing without malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate, with low malware and obfuscation scores, and a modest security risk score due to the technique's potential for misuse in malicious contexts. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with the reports' assessments.",
