  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes for the Requests library; no data processing or external input.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Comments:** The code is purely class definitions with no malicious behavior. The high confidence and no obfuscation or malware are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard exception classes, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Comments:** No issues; the code is straightforward.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes and warnings, standard patterns, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Comments:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard exception class definitions, no data leaks or malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Comments:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with a note on the `__reduce__` method for pickling, which is standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero)\n- **Comments:** The only notable point is the `__reduce__` method, which is typical for pickling. The slight increase in security risk score seems to be a conservative measure; there's no indication of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code contains only class definitions with no external code execution, network activity, or data handling. There are no signs of malware or malicious payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear, straightforward, and follows standard patterns.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.1. Given the nature of the code—just exception class definitions—any risk is negligible. The slight increase in report 5's risk score due to the `__reduce__` method is overly cautious but not unjustified.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- No changes are necessary; the code is benign.\n- The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in report 5 is acceptable given the use of pickling, which can sometimes be exploited if misused, but in this context, it is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\n**Overall malware score:** **0**  \n**Overall obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Overall risk score:** **0** (or at most 0.1 for conservative caution)\n\nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security issues.",
