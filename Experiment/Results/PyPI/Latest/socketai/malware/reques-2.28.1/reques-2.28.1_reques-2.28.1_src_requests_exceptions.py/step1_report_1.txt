{
  "purpose": "This module defines various exception classes for handling errors in the Requests library, including network, decoding, and HTTP errors.",
  "sources": "None. The code primarily consists of class definitions and imports, not data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None. There are no functions or code that process untrusted data or perform actions that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Not applicable. The code contains class definitions without any executable flows involving data input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code adheres to standard exception class definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions and defines custom exception classes for the Requests library. Each class is a straightforward subclass of built-in exceptions or other classes, with no dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity. The structure and content follow standard patterns for defining exceptions, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The import statements are standard, and the class definitions are typical for an error-handling module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions for the Requests library. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks within this code. It appears to be purely for error handling and does not perform any harmful actions.",
