  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of exception class definitions, imports, and docstrings.\n   - No dynamic code, data processing, or external data handling is present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is standard, well-structured, and typical for an exception module.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious content.\n   - Security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report noting 0.1—this is acceptable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any behavior that warrants a high risk score.\n   - The highest noted security risk is 0.1, which is reasonable for a standard exception module.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports agree on a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, so this is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No suspicious claims or assumptions are present.\n   - The analyses are cautious and consistent with the code's content.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the content and purpose of the code.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable adjustments are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a straightforward, standard set of exception class definitions for the Requests library.**  \n**No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements are present.**  \n**The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.**\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0 (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.05, to account for minimal security risk due to the nature of the code)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is benign, well-structured, and safe. It serves a clear purpose in error handling without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
