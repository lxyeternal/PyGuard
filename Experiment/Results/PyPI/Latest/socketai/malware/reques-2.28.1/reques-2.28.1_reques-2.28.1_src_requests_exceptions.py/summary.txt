  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for error handling in the Requests library. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is 0. The minimal risk score of 0.1 noted in one report is acceptable but can be conservatively lowered to 0, given the benign nature."
