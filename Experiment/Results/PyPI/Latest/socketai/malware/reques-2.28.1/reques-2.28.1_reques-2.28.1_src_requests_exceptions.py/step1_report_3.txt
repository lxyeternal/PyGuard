{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes and warnings related to HTTP request handling in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; defines custom exception classes and imports from other modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; exception classes could be used to handle errors in data processing.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and handling flow, but no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. Exception classes are standard. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a hierarchy of exception classes and warnings used within the Requests library for handling various HTTP errors and conditions. It imports exceptions from urllib3 and compat modules. No code executes external commands, network calls, or data leaks. The exception classes include typical HTTP and connection errors, with no unusual or hidden behavior. The code appears standard, well-structured, and serves a clear purpose without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward exception and warning class definitions for a networking library. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. It appears to be a standard, safe component of the Requests package.",
