{
  "purpose": "This code provides the core classes and functions for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses within the Requests library, enabling users to send HTTP requests and process responses.",
  "sources": "User inputs such as method, URL, headers, data, files, json, cookies, and hooks; internal functions that parse URLs, encode parameters/files, and manage request preparation.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission of prepared requests, response data processing, and handling of response content, headers, and status codes.",
  "flows": "User provides request data -> Request class constructs request -> PreparedRequest encodes data and sets headers -> Request sent over network -> Response received -> Response processed and data extracted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code uses standard libraries and functions for HTTP request handling without hidden or obfuscated logic. No code executes external commands, modifies system files, or performs network connections beyond the expected request/response cycle.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and methods for building and processing HTTP requests and responses. It employs standard practices for URL encoding, header validation, cookie management, JSON serialization/deserialization, and streaming response handling. No embedded or dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or network connections other than standard HTTP communication are present. The code is well-structured with clear separation of concerns, and all imports and functions appear legitimate and consistent with the Requests library's functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code functions as part of the Requests library's core request/response handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms. There are no signs of supply chain attacks or harmful code. Overall, it appears to be legitimate and secure code supporting HTTP communications.",
