{
  "purpose": "This module defines core classes and utilities for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Data sources include user-provided input such as URL, headers, data, files, JSON, and cookies; and internally used modules for encoding, URL parsing, and cookie management.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission (raw stream, request body, headers), file reading (e.g., in prepare_files), and JSON decoding, which could be misused for data exfiltration or injection if data is maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (e.g., URL, headers, data, files, cookies) flows into request preparation functions, which encode, validate, and assemble the request body and headers, then send over network via raw stream or request body. Response content and headers are processed for potential leaks or misinterpretation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. The code performs encoding, URL parsing, and request preparation securely. No backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution is present. Usage of exception handling is standard. The handling of JSON and stream data appears conventional, with no hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically constructs HTTP requests, encodes parameters and files, manages cookies, and prepares headers and authentication. It decodes response content, detects encodings, and provides methods for iterating response data. All functionalities follow standard practices without suspicious logic. No signs of malicious code, such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden behaviors, are evident. The code is well-structured and adheres to expected behaviors for an HTTP client library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an HTTP request/response handling module within the Requests library, with no detectable malicious intent or security risks. It handles user input securely and performs expected request/response operations without anomalies.",
