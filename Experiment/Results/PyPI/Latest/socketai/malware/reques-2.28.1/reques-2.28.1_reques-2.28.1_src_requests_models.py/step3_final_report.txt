{
  "purpose": "The code implements core classes and functions for constructing, encoding, and handling HTTP requests and responses within the Requests library, facilitating request preparation, URL encoding, header management, cookie handling, JSON serialization, and response parsing.",
  "sources": "User-provided input such as method, URL, headers, data, files, JSON payload, cookies, and hooks; internal functions like parse_url, to_key_val_list, and encoding detection libraries.",
  "sinks": "Request components (headers, body, URL), response decoding, JSON parsing, and hook invocation; potential data flows from untrusted input to network transmission and response processing.",
  "flows": "Input data (method, URL, headers, data, files, JSON, cookies) flows into request construction, encoding functions, and hook processing; response content flows into decoding, JSON parsing, and header analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected; standard library usage and well-understood patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an HTTP client, handling request and response lifecycle with proper encoding, header validation, cookie management, and streaming. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External libraries used for encoding detection are standard and do not introduce security concerns. The code structure and logic follow best practices, with no signs of sabotage or hidden behaviors. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified given the code's purpose and lack of vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, secure, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1) are consistent with the detailed analysis. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
