{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities and classes for handling cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, management, and conversion functions.",
  "sources": "Reads request URL, headers, and cookies; accesses response headers; reads cookie attributes and cookie jar data structures.",
  "sinks": "Generates and sets cookie headers; modifies cookie jars; potentially raises exceptions on invalid input.",
  "flows": "Request URL/headers → cookie extraction functions → cookie jar modifications → cookie header generation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code primarily handles cookie parsing and management. No suspicious network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mock classes for requests and responses to facilitate cookie handling, as well as functions for extracting cookies from responses, generating cookie headers, and managing cookies within a jar. It uses standard libraries and well-known patterns for cookie handling. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system damage, or unauthorized access are detected. All functions perform expected operations related to cookie management, with no obfuscated code or unusual logic. The handling of exceptions and cookie attributes appears standard. The code relies on the standard cookiejar and request handling patterns without introducing hidden or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie management utilities used for compatibility and handling within the requests library. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It is a safe, expected part of cookie handling infrastructure.",
