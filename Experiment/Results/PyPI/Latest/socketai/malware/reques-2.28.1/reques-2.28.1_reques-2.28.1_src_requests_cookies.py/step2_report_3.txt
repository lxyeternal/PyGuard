  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects: presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, security risks, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources**: Standard cookie management utilities, reading request/response headers and cookie data.  \n- **Sinks & Flows**: Cookie header creation, extraction, and management.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No suspicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses standard patterns.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Clearly benign, high confidence (0.95), malware score 0, security risk 0.2 (due to typical cookie handling).  \n\n**Score assessment**:  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity) — **appropriate**  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — **appropriate**  \n- Risk: 0.2 — acceptable, as cookie handling can be misused if misconfigured but not inherently risky here.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard cookie handling, no suspicious behavior, high confidence (0.95), malware 0.  \n- Security risk is 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.  \n\n**Score assessment**:  \n- Malware: 0 — **appropriate**  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — **appropriate**  \n- Risk: 0 — consistent with the description  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- Focuses on compatibility utilities, standard functions, no malicious activity.  \n- High confidence (1), malware 0, security risk 0.  \n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.  \n\n**Score assessment**:  \n- Malware: 0 — **appropriate**  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — **appropriate**  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- Describes standard cookie management, no suspicious code, high confidence (1), malware 0.  \n- No obfuscation, no malicious behavior.  \n\n**Score assessment**:  \n- Malware: 0 — **appropriate**  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — **appropriate**  \n- Risk: 0 — consistent  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- Similar to previous reports, utility functions for cookie handling, no suspicious activity, confidence 0.9, malware 0.  \n- No obfuscation, no malicious behavior.  \n\n**Score assessment**:  \n- Malware: 0 — **appropriate**  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — **appropriate**  \n- Risk: 0.2 — acceptable, standard cookie handling  \n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis**:  \n- All reports consistently identify the code as standard, benign cookie management utilities.  \n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious network activity.  \n- Malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports.  \n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting typical cookie handling concerns but no specific vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**Estimated scores for the entire code:**\n\n- **Malware**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated**: **0** — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation patterns.  \n- **Risk**: **0.1 to 0.2** — Slightly elevated due to cookie handling, but generally low risk.\n\n**Justification**:  \nThe code is a well-structured, standard implementation of cookie utilities, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The small security risk score accounts for the potential misuse of cookie management if misconfigured, but nothing in the code indicates active vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion**:  \nThe code is safe, legitimate, and well within expected behavior for cookie management utilities used in the requests library. The current scores are appropriate; I would recommend keeping malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and risk around 0.1–0.2.",
