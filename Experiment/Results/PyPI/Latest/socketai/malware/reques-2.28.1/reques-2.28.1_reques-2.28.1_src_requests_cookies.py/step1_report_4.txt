  "purpose": "Provides compatibility and utility functions for managing cookies in the 'requests' library, including a dict-like interface for cookie jars.",
  "sources": "Reads request URL, headers, cookie attributes, and input parameters such as cookie name, value, domain, path, and cookie dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Creates cookies, updates cookie jars, extracts cookies from responses, and produces cookie headers for requests.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (cookie names, values, request URLs, headers) flow into cookie creation and manipulation functions; cookie jars are updated or queried; cookies are extracted from responses and set in jars; cookie headers are generated for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No suspicious external calls or obfuscated code. Usage of threading is standard and safely handled.",
  "analysis": "The code offers cookie management utilities compatible with 'http.cookiejar' and 'requests'. It includes functions to create cookies, convert Morsel objects, manipulate cookie jars, and extract cookies from responses. All functions are standard and focus on cookie handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or data exfiltration. No insecure code patterns or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is structured clearly, with proper handling of expected inputs and exceptions. No external network connections, reverse shells, or privacy leaks are evident. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate utility module for cookie handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate utility module for managing cookies within the 'requests' library, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
