  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of cookie management utilities used in HTTP client libraries. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
