{
  "purpose": "Provides cookie management utilities, including classes and functions for extracting, creating, merging, and manipulating cookies within HTTP request/response workflows.",
  "sources": "Request headers (e.g., 'Cookie', 'Host'), response headers (e.g., 'Set-Cookie'), cookie dictionaries, and request/response objects.",
  "sinks": "Cookie headers sent in requests, cookie jars storing cookies, and functions modifying or removing cookies.",
  "flows": "Cookies are extracted from response headers into cookie jars; cookie headers are generated from cookie jars for requests; cookies can be added, removed, or merged within jars.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. The code uses standard patterns and libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie handling utilities compatible with http.cookiejar and requests. It includes classes like RequestsCookieJar, MockRequest, and MockResponse, as well as functions for cookie extraction, creation, and removal. No suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The functions perform expected operations such as header parsing, cookie creation, and jar management. The code is clear, well-structured, and relies on standard libraries, indicating benign intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misuse of cookies if misconfigured, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of cookie management utilities used in HTTP client libraries. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
