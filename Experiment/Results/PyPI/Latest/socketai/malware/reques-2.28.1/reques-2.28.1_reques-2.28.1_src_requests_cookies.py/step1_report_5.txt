  "purpose": "Provides utility classes and functions to handle cookies, including compatibility wrappers for use with requests, and methods for managing cookie jars.",
  "sources": "Reading request URL, headers, and response headers; accessing cookie attributes; creating and manipulating cookies.",
  "sinks": "Adding headers to requests; setting or deleting cookies in cookie jars; extracting cookies from responses.",
  "flows": "Request URL and headers → cookie jar extraction/updates → request headers set with cookies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or hidden malicious code detected. The code performs standard cookie management tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for handling cookies within the requests library, including wrappers for request and response objects, and methods for cookie extraction, setting, removal, and merging. The functions use standard Python modules like calendar, time, copy, threading, and the standard cookie handling via http.cookiejar.CookieJar. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious network activity are present. The code maintains a focus on managing cookies safely and compatibly, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The overall design appears to be standard for cookie handling in HTTP client libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for cookie management in the requests library with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It handles cookies properly and safely, focusing on compatibility and correctness.",
