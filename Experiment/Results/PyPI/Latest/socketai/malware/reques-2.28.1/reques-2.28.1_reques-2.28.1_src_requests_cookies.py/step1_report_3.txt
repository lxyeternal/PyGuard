  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies with the requests library, including cookie extraction, creation, management, and conversion between different formats.",
  "sources": "Reads cookie headers, request URL and headers, environment variables, and response headers.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies headers with 'add_unredirected_header'; accesses and manipulates cookies via internal methods; constructs cookie headers; interacts with cookie jars.",
  "flows": "Extracts cookies from responses into cookie jars; creates cookie headers for requests; sets, deletes, and updates cookies within cookie jars; converts cookies from different formats; reads request URLs and headers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious domain references. Uses standard cookie management patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code comments and structure are consistent with legitimate cookie handling utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions to manage cookies in a manner compatible with Python's http.cookiejar. It includes mock request/response wrappers, cookie extraction, creation, deletion, and merging functions. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or backdoor behaviors are detected. Functions primarily interact with cookie data structures, headers, and request/response objects in a standard manner. There are no hidden or malicious behaviors; the code appears to serve as a utility for cookie handling within the requests library.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard cookie management utilities for the requests library, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malicious behavior. It handles cookie creation, extraction, deletion, and merging securely and transparently. No malware or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
