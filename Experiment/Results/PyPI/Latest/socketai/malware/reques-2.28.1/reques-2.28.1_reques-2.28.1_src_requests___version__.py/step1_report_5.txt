  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static metadata values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated elements detected. The code consists solely of straightforward metadata variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of straightforward variable assignments containing static metadata about the package. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The variables define package information such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and custom metadata. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package metadata declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a legitimate open-source library setup. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
