  "purpose": "Defines metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Reads static metadata variables assigned in the script (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points leading to external systems or untrusted data processing identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical points; only static assignment of package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present. All code is straightforward metadata assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of variable assignments containing package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright. There are no inputs, outputs, external data flows, or executable logic that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external network interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign and serves as package metadata declaration. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
