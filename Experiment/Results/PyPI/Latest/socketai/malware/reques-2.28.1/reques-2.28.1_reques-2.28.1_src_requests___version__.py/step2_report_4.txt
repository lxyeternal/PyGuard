  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely static metadata assignment with no dynamic or malicious elements.\n- The code contains only variable definitions with string and numeric literals, including some Unicode characters used decoratively.\n- No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code is typical for package setup or documentation purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  **Yes.** The code only assigns static variables; no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- **No.** The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, consistent with the straightforward code.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is correct.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since the code is purely static metadata with no dynamic or external activity, any score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n### Potential assumptions and claims:\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about hidden behavior or obfuscation; they rely on code inspection, which is sufficient here.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is entirely benign, serving only as package metadata declaration. No security concerns are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious content.\n- The scores assigned are accurate and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
