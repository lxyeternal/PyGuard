  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library",
  "sources": "Assignment of string and numeric literals to metadata variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; no sinks present",
  "flows": "Initialization of variables with static values; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code solely assigns static metadata variables with no dynamic or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code only sets metadata variables such as __title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, etc. All values are static strings or numbers. No input handling, no network connections, and no execution of untrusted data. The code is typical for package setup or metadata declaration, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package metadata declaration for the 'requests' library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
