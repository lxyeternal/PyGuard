  "purpose": "Package metadata declaration for the 'requests' library, including descriptive information and author details.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments containing package info (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is static with no dynamic execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative Unicode characters in __cake__ are harmless; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. There are no functions, input/output, network activity, or dynamic behaviors. Unicode characters are decorative and do not indicate obfuscation. Multiple reviews correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, harmless nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, static declaration of package metadata with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
