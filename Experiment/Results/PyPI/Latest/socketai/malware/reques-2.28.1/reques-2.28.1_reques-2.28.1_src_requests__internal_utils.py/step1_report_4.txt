{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions for the Requests library, mainly for string handling and header validation.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input directly; header validation regexes process header strings, but not from untrusted sources within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "The 'decode' method in 'to_native_string' could process external data, but only if the input is untrusted. No direct external data sinks such as network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data could flow from external sources into 'to_native_string', which decodes byte strings. The validation regexes could be used to validate headers, but no malicious flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or hidden behavior present. The regex patterns are standard for header validation. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code provides string conversion and header validation functions for internal use within the Requests library. Regex patterns are standard and used for header validation. The 'to_native_string' function converts input to native strings, decoding bytes if necessary. The 'unicode_is_ascii' function checks if a string contains only ASCII characters. There are no external data sinks or malicious code. The code appears to be straightforward utility functions with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code used internally within a library for string handling and validation. There are no malicious behaviors, supply chain risks, or suspicious anomalies detected.",
