{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions for the Requests library, mainly for handling headers and string conversions.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily from the function parameters: 'string' and 'u_string'. External data could influence function inputs if used externally.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from functions 'to_native_string' and 'unicode_is_ascii'. No external sinks such as network, file, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'string' flows through 'to_native_string' which may decode bytes; 'u_string' is checked for ASCII in 'unicode_is_ascii'. No external flows or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The regex patterns and functions are standard; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior. No obfuscation or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for validating HTTP headers and provides functions for string conversion and ASCII checks. The functions operate solely on input parameters without side effects. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The code appears to be standard utility functions without external calls or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of utility functions for string handling and validation within the Requests library. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
