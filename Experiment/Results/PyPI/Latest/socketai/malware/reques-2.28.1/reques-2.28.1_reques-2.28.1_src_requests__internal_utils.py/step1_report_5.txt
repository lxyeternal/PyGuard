  "purpose": "Utility functions for internal use in the Requests library, primarily for header validation and string handling.",
  "sources": "Input data is processed through function parameters such as 'string' and 'u_string'.",
  "sinks": "The functions perform data transformation and validation, with no evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through type checks, decoding, and encoding functions, with no external system interaction or unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The code strictly performs validation and string handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides regex-based validation for HTTP headers and string conversion functions. It uses safe practices like type assertions and try-except for encoding checks. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded secrets are present. The functions are straightforward utility implementations without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for string and header validation in the Requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
