{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for internal use within the Requests library, mainly for handling headers and string conversions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'string' parameter in to_native_string and from 'u_string' parameter in unicode_is_ascii.",
  "sinks": "The decode method in to_native_string writes data to a string output; encode in unicode_is_ascii checks for ASCII compliance.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings or bytes) is decoded or checked for ASCII compliance; no external or untrusted sources are explicitly handled.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The functions are straightforward utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for header validation, which are standard and safe. The to_native_string function converts bytes to strings using ASCII encoding if needed; it relies on the built-in decode method, which is safe here. The unicode_is_ascii function checks whether a string contains only ASCII characters by attempting to encode it as ASCII, which is a common and safe operation. There are no dynamic code executions, external data fetches, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be standard utility functions for string and header validation without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, intended as utility functions for internal processing in the Requests library. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
