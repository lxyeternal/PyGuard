  "purpose": "Utility functions for header validation and string conversion within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: 'string' in 'to_native_string', 'u_string' in 'unicode_is_ascii'. Regex patterns used for header validation.",
  "sinks": "None; functions do not write to external systems or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation regexes and conversion functions without external or malicious effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward regex patterns and string handling functions, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides regex patterns for header validation and two utility functions for string conversion and ASCII checking. It operates solely on input parameters, with no external system interaction, network activity, or data exfiltration. Regex patterns are standard for header validation. Functions are simple, safe, and intended for internal use. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score should be 0, reflecting the benign nature of these utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard utility functions with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores in the reports are appropriate, but the risk score should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy, especially in reports 1 and 2 where it was overestimated. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
