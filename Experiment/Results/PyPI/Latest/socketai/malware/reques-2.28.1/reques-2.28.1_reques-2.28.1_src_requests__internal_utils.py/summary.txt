  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard utility functions with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores in the reports are appropriate, but the risk score should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy, especially in reports 1 and 2 where it was overestimated. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent."
