  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence and behavior**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code imports `certifi.where` and prints its value. The code is minimal, straightforward, and intended solely to output the CA bundle path. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n\n2. **Potential issues or anomalies**:  \n   None of the reports find any anomalies, secrets, or malicious behavior. The code does not accept untrusted input, perform network operations, or include any hidden logic.\n\n3. **Scores assessment**:\n   - **Malware score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, transparent code.\n   - **Security risk score**: All assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the script.\n\n4. **Logic and reasoning**:\n   - The reports are consistent and correct in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code's purpose is informational, with no security risks.\n   - No report overstates or underestimates the risk or malware potential.\n\n5. **Conclusion and recommendations**:\n   - The overall assessment is accurate: the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate** after reviewing all reports:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score**: 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**Final note**: The code is a simple utility to display the path to the CA bundle from `certifi`. It does not pose any security threat and is correctly scored as such.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.  \n- The scores are appropriate.  \n- No changes needed.",
