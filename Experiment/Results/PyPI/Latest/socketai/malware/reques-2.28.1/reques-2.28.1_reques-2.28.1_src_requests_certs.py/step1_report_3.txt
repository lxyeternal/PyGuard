  "purpose": "The code provides a simple utility to print the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the path to standard output using print().",
  "flows": "The data flows from certifi.where() to the print() function, which outputs the result.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses standard library functions without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the certifi package, then prints its result when executed as a main module. The purpose is to display the default CA bundle path. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or suspicious code constructs. No input or untrusted data processing occurs. The code is simple, well-structured, and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility script that outputs the path to the certifi CA bundle. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
