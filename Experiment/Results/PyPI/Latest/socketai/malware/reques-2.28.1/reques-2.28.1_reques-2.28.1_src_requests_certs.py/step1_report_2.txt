  "purpose": "To provide the default CA certificate bundle path used by requests, based on the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import statement for certifi.where and the print statement calling where()",
  "sinks": "The output of the where() function is printed to standard output",
  "flows": "The code imports certifi.where as a data source, then calls and prints its result; this data flow is straightforward and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, hidden backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code simply exposes the path to a CA bundle.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a well-known, reputable library (certifi) to obtain the path to a CA certificate bundle and prints this path when executed as a script. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data manipulation, and no network activity or other potentially malicious operations. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to SSL certificate management. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility that outputs the path to a trusted CA bundle. It performs no malicious actions or security risks. The implementation is simple and transparent.",
