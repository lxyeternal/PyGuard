{
  "purpose": "Provides the default CA certificate bundle path using the certifi package",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from certifi; calling 'where()' function in main",
  "sinks": "Printing the result of 'where()' to standard output",
  "flows": "Import -> Function call -> Print output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for fetching CA bundle path",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the 'certifi' package, which returns the path to the trusted CA bundle. In the main block, it simply prints this path. There are no input sources other than the standard import, and the output is a benign print statement. No data leaks, no network activity, no secrets or credentials are involved. The code is simple and aligns with typical usage for obtaining CA certificates.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility script that outputs the CA bundle path; there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a harmless function with no suspicious activities.",
