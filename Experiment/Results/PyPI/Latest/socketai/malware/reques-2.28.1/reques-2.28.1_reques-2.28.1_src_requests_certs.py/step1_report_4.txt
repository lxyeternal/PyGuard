  "flows": "Import certifi.where -> Call where() -> Print result",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected; straightforward use of a well-known package.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function 'where' from the certifi package and prints its output when executed directly. The certifi package is a reputable library providing SSL CA certificates. The script's purpose is to inform users of the CA bundle location, which is standard behavior. No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The code is minimal, clear, and intended for informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simply providing the path to the default CA bundle. No signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility script.",
