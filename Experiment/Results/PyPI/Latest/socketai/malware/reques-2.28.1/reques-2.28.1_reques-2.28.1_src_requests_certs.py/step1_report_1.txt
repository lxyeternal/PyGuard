  "purpose": "To return the default CA certificate bundle path using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The source ('where') provides the CA bundle path, which flows into the print statement and is output to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints its value if run as main. The purpose is to display the CA bundle path. There are no input sources that accept untrusted data, no sinks that transmit data over networks, and no unusual code patterns. The code is minimal and conventional, serving a benign purpose. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to display the default CA bundle path from 'certifi'. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks present.",
