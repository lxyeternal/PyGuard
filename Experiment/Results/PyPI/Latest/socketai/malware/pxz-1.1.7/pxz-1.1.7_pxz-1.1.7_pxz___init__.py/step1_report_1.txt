{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for data processing or manipulation, but without specific context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly present; the code does not contain functions that read external input or data from files, network, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are limited to standard output (print statements) or variable assignments; no direct data leaks or external data transmissions are evident.",
  "flows": "The code performs internal variable assignments and computations; no flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks is detected.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward variable assignments, mathematical operations, and control flow. It does not include any suspicious functions or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code's structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. Lack of external input handling reduces the likelihood of injection or data leakage. However, without additional context or comments, the full intent is uncertain.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a simple, transparent script without suspicious or malicious elements.",
