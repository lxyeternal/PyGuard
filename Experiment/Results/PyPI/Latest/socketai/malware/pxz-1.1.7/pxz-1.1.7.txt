      "conclusion": "The code exhibits privacy-invasive behavior by silently collecting and exfiltrating system information during package installation. It does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation. The activity is suspicious and potentially malicious in terms of privacy violations, but not overt malware. The scores are appropriate; malware score should be around 0.2-0.3, and security risk should be high (~0.8). It warrants caution and further review before use."
