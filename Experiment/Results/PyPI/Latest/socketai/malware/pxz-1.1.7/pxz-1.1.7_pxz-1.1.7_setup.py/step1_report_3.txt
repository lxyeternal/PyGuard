  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to a specified server during package installation.",
  "sources": "URLError when attempting to connect to the server, urlopen requests for system info and data transmission, os.uname() and os.getcwd() for system info, environment variables if any are indirectly involved, and input data via URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "Network request to http://35.170.187.220:8080/ with system data, potentially exposing sensitive system info to an external server.",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() gathers system data, encodes it into URL parameters, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to the specified server when on_install() is triggered during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code actively collects detailed system info and transmits it to a remote IP address without user consent or clear disclosure, which is suspicious behavior. No user input validation or consent prompt is present. The server URL is hardcoded. The data sent includes hostname, IP, current directory, and current time, which can be used for fingerprinting or tracking.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function collect_system_info() that retrieves public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, and timestamp. It then encodes this info into URL parameters and sends an HTTP GET request to a fixed IP address. This occurs during the package's on_install() function, which is linked via entry points, meaning it runs during installation. The behavior resembles covert data exfiltration or fingerprinting, especially given the hardcoded server URL and detailed system info collection. There are no obvious code injection or obfuscation techniques, but the code performs privacy-invading actions without user notice. The presence of network communication during installation is suspicious. No malicious payload such as reverse shells or file damage is detected, but the data collection and transmission are privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly collects and transmits system information to an external server during package installation, which constitutes malicious privacy-invading behavior. The code does not appear obfuscated or malicious in the traditional malware sense but is highly suspicious for malicious intent due to data exfiltration without user consent.",
