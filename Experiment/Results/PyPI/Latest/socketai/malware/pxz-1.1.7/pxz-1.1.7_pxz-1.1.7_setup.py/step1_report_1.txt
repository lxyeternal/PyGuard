{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information and send it to a specified remote server, likely as part of a package installation process.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, home directory, current directory, current time, and makes HTTP requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to external server with collected system data; potential data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() gathers data -> encodes it into URL parameters -> sends GET request to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Automatically collects and transmits system IP, hostname, directories, and current time without user consent; triggers on package install via entry point. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected. The server URL and data transmission could be used for tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for network communication and system info. It defines a function collect_system_info() that retrieves public IP address, hostname, user home directory, current working directory, and current time. It then constructs a GET request to a specific server URL, appending the data as URL parameters, and sends the request. The function is invoked during package installation via the 'pxz-on-install' console script entry point. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious system modifications. The code performs data collection and exfiltration silently at install time, which could be used maliciously to track or harvest user info without explicit consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function appears to be gathering and transmitting system information during installation. While technically not malware, it exhibits behavior characteristic of potential privacy-invasive tracking or data exfiltration. It warrants caution, especially if the user did not explicitly consent to data sharing. No malicious system modifications or backdoors are detected, but the data transmission is suspicious.",
