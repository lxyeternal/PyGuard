{
  "purpose": "Collects system information (public IP, hostname, directories, current time) and sends it to a specified remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system info such as public IP via URL, hostname via os.uname(), directories via os.path, and current time via datetime.now().",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://35.170.187.220:8080/).",
  "flows": "System info is collected and formatted into URL parameters, then transmitted over the network to the specified server.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes network communication during package installation without user consent. It does not validate or restrict the destination URL. The collection and transmission of system info appear to be done surreptitiously. The IP address and server URL are hardcoded. The code runs automatically upon installation via entry point, which can be considered suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers various system data, including public IP, hostname, user home directory, current directory, and timestamp. It then constructs a GET request URL with these parameters and sends this data to a remote IP address. The use of urllib to perform network operations during setup indicates potential malicious intent, especially since it transmits data without user knowledge. No user prompts or consent mechanisms are present. The data collection is straightforward but appears designed for covert data exfiltration. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration, and the URL is hardcoded, which can be malicious if intended for malicious data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform covert system information exfiltration during package installation. It collects and sends data to an external server without user consent, which is suspicious. There are no signs of more complex malicious behaviors such as malware payloads, backdoors, or data theft beyond system info transmission. The overall behavior suggests a potentially malicious activity focused on user tracking or surveillance.",
