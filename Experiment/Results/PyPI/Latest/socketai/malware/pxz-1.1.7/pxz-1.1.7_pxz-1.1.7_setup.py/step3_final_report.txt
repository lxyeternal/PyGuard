  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data collection of system info and transmits it to a hardcoded external server during package installation, triggered via an entry point. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or system modifications. The behavior is privacy-invasive and resembles covert tracking or exfiltration, but lacks malicious payloads such as code injection or destructive actions. The data sent includes sensitive system info, which could be used for fingerprinting or surveillance. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.2-0.5, security risk 0.4-0.75) are consistent with this behavior. Given the absence of malicious payloads, the malware score should be low, but the privacy invasion warrants a high security risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits privacy-invasive behavior by silently collecting and exfiltrating system information during package installation. It does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation. The activity is suspicious and potentially malicious in terms of privacy violations, but not overt malware. The scores are appropriate; malware score should be around 0.2-0.3, and security risk should be high (~0.8). It warrants caution and further review before use.",
