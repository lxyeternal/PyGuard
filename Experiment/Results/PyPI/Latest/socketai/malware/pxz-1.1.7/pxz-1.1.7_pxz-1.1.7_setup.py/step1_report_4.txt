{
  "purpose": "Collects and sends system information (public IP, hostname, directories, current time) to a specified remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "URL request to 'https://api.ipify.org' for public IP, os.uname() for hostname, os.path.expanduser() and os.getcwd() for directories, datetime.now() for current time.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to a remote server ('http://35.170.187.220:8080/') with system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() gathers data from sources and sends it via HTTP GET request to the server URL, triggered during package installation via on_install().",
  "anomalies": "The code collects system info and transmits it to an external server without explicit user consent or obvious benign purpose. Uses hardcoded server URL, and the collection is performed during installation which may be unexpected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to collect system info such as public IP, hostname, directories, and current time. It then sends this info via an HTTP GET request to a fixed external IP address. This behavior occurs during package installation through an entry point 'pxz-on-install'. The code does not contain obfuscation, encryption, or concealment mechanisms. While the network activity is straightforward, it performs unsolicited data exfiltration, which is suspicious for a package intended for benign purposes. No malicious payload like code injection or destructive actions is present, but the data collection and transmission are privacy-invasive and could be malicious if done without user knowledge. The server URL is hardcoded and remote, indicating potential tracking or data collection beyond typical package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system data collection and exfiltration during installation, which is suspicious and could constitute privacy invasion or malicious tracking. It does not execute malicious payloads but leverages standard libraries for potentially covert data transfer. Overall, the activity raises security concerns due to unconsented data transmission, despite the lack of overt malware.",
