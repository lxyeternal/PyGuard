      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious-like behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation without user consent. While it lacks destructive payloads, its privacy-invasive nature warrants high security concern. The malware score should be increased to approximately 0.85, and the overall security risk should be rated around 0.9. The behavior is consistent with malicious activity, and the scores should reflect this elevated threat level."
