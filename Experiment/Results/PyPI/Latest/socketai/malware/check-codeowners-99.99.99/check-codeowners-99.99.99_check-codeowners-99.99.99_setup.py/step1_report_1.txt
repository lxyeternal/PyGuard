  "purpose": "This code customizes the installation process of a Python package, performing system information collection and sending data to a Slack webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "os.popen('uname -a'), os.popen('ifconfig'), os.popen('curl ifconfig.me'), os.popen('systeminfo'), os.popen('ipconfig'), os.popen('tasklist'), os.popen('whoami'), os.popen('hostname')",
  "sinks": "os.system('curl -X POST ...')",
  "flows": "Sources (system info and user info) are collected via os.popen calls; data is then formatted into a JSON payload and sent via a system call to a remote Slack webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "The script collects detailed system information and immediately posts it to an external URL during installation, which could be used for malicious data exfiltration. The use of os.popen and os.system for executing commands and transmitting data without user consent is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'run' method of the install class to gather system details such as OS info, network configuration, and user identity. It then constructs a JSON message embedding this data and sends it to a specified Slack webhook URL using an os.system call with curl. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious as it exfiltrates sensitive system information without explicit user approval. The code does not perform any malicious actions beyond data collection and transmission but does so in a manner that violates typical privacy expectations. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are present, but the automatic data exfiltration is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information gathering and transmits this data to an external webhook during installation without user consent. This behavior indicates potential malicious intent, specifically data exfiltration. While it doesn't perform destructive actions, the silent collection and sending of sensitive system data is suspicious and should be flagged for review.",
