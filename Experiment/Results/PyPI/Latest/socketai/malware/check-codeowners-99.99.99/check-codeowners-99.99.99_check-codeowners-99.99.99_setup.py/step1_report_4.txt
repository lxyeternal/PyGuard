{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it via a Slack webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "Input data from system commands ('uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'whoami', 'hostname', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist') and environment (platform).",
  "sinks": "Uses os.popen and os.system to execute commands and send data via an HTTP POST request with curl to a Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system commands (sources), stored in variables, formatted into a JSON payload, and sent over the network to a Slack webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The script collects potentially sensitive system information and sends it unconditionally during installation, which could be considered privacy-invasive. The use of os.popen and os.system for executing system commands is potentially dangerous if inputs are manipulated, though in this case, the commands are static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon running, gathers system info such as OS details, IP addresses, hostname, user info, and process lists using system commands. It then constructs a JSON payload with this data and sends it via curl to a Slack webhook URL, potentially exposing sensitive system data. The data collection occurs unconditionally during installation, which can be privacy-invasive or malicious if the package is used without user consent. The code does not perform any validation or obfuscation, and the commands used are standard but sensitive. No hardcoded credentials are evident apart from the webhook URL, which is publicly visible in the code, indicating a security risk. Overall, the code exhibits behavior consistent with data exfiltration during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The script secretly collects detailed system information and transmits it to an external Slack channel during installation, which is malicious behavior. It appears designed to exfiltrate data without user awareness or consent, representing a significant security concern.",
