{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to gather system information and send it via a webhook, likely for monitoring or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Data sources include 'os.popen' commands for 'uname', 'ifconfig', 'curl', 'whoami', and 'hostname'.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call executes a curl command that sends collected system info to an external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info collected via 'os.popen' and 'os.system' commands are concatenated into a JSON payload and sent over the network through the 'curl' command.",
  "anomalies": "The code unconditionally collects detailed system information across different OS platforms and then sends this data externally without any apparent user consent or control. The webhook URL is hardcoded and appears to be a Slack integration, which could be used maliciously to exfiltrate data.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, during the 'run' method, executes system commands to gather environment and system information depending on OS platform. It then constructs a payload with this data and posts it to a Slack webhook URL using 'curl' via 'os.system'. This action is performed every time the package is installed, without any user prompts or safeguards. The data sent includes hostname, username, public IP, OS info, and process list, which could be considered sensitive. The use of hardcoded webhook URL is suspicious, as it indicates external data exfiltration. The code does not perform any validation or user control over this data collection and transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly collecting detailed system information and exfiltrating it to an external webhook during installation without user consent. This behavior poses security and privacy risks, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
