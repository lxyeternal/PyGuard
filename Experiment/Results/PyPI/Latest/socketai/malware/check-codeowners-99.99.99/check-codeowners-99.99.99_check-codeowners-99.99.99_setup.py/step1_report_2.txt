{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that gathers system information and sends it via a POST request to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls to retrieve system info, username, hostname, and network configuration; os.system() executing curl command with system info.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing a curl command with a payload containing system info; os.popen() calls retrieving sensitive system data.",
  "flows": "System information collected via os.popen() flows into the payload of the curl POST request sent to the Slack webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects detailed system information and sends it externally without user consent or obvious purpose; no validation or obfuscation; use of hardcoded webhook URL; potential privacy violation.",
  "analysis": "The script hooks into the installation process of a Python package, gathering OS details, network info, user, and hostname data via os.popen(). It then constructs a JSON payload containing this data and transmits it to a Slack webhook URL using os.system(). The collection and transmission of detailed system info without user awareness is suspicious and can be classified as data exfiltration. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and lack of any user notification or consent increases the risk. No malicious code execution or malware behavior is evident, but the behavior is highly privacy-invasive and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly collects and transmits system information during package installation without user consent, posing significant privacy and security risks. It does not contain malicious payloads like system damage or backdoors, but its data exfiltration behavior makes it suspicious and potentially malicious.",
