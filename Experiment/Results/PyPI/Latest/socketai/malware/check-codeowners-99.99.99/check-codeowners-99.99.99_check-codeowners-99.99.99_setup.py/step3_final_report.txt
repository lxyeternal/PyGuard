{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information during installation and sends it to a specified Slack webhook URL without user consent, acting as a covert data exfiltration mechanism.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls retrieving system info, hostname, whoami, and public IP; static command execution during setup run.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing curl command to external webhook URL, transmitting collected data.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered via os.popen() and passed into a JSON payload, which is then sent via os.system() to the external URL during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data collection and transmission during install without user notification; hardcoded webhook URL; use of os.popen() and os.system() for external communication; no obfuscation or encryption.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward system info collection and exfiltration during package installation, which is suspicious and privacy-invasive. It does not contain malicious payloads like destructive commands or backdoors but silently transmits sensitive data to an external service. The behavior is consistent across reports, with the primary concern being unconsented data exfiltration. The use of static commands and hardcoded URL indicates malicious intent or at least malicious privacy violations. The malware score should be adjusted upward to reflect this high suspicion, and the security risk score remains high due to privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious-like behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation without user consent. While it lacks destructive payloads, its privacy-invasive nature warrants high security concern. The malware score should be increased to approximately 0.85, and the overall security risk should be rated around 0.9. The behavior is consistent with malicious activity, and the scores should reflect this elevated threat level.",
