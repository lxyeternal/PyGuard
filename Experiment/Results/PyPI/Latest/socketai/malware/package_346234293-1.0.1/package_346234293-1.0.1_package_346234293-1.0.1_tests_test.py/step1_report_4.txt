  "purpose": "Unit testing the 'add' function from the 'package_346234293' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'pytest' and 'add' function from the package.",
  "sinks": "The code executes assertions on the 'add' function, which is a sink for test validation.",
  "flows": "The source is the import of 'add'; the sink is the assertions testing 'add' with various inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework and a function from a package, then defines a straightforward test function that asserts expected outputs for the 'add' function with different inputs. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The package name 'package_346234293' appears non-descriptive but does not imply malicious intent. The test code is typical for Python unit testing and does not contain malicious or security-risk behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test for a simple addition function with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
