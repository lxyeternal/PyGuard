{
  "purpose": "A simple pytest unit test for the 'add' function imported from package_346234293.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'add' function from the package; no external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only performs assertions on the 'add' function output.",
  "flows": "Input values (1, 2), (-1, 1), and (0, 0) flow into the 'add' function, with results checked via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard unit test with no malicious or suspicious elements. It imports a function and asserts expected outputs with static inputs. No external data flows, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The package name is non-descriptive but does not imply malicious intent. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no anomalies or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test with no malicious intent or security issues. The package name alone does not suggest malicious activity. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, reflecting the harmless nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
