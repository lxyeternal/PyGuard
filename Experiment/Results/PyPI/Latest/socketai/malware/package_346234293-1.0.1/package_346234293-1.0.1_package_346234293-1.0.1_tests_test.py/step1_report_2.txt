{
  "purpose": "The code is a test script using pytest to verify the functionality of the 'add' function from 'package_346234293'.",
  "sources": "The code reads test input values directly within the test cases.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to send or process untrusted data or produce side effects such as data leakage or network communication.",
  "flows": "Input values are passed directly to the 'add' function; there are no complex data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The import 'package_346234293' could be suspicious if malicious, but from code perspective, it is a normal package import.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a package and tests a simple addition function with three assertions. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code strictly performs unit testing and does not include network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. The package name might be suspicious if the package is malicious, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test script for an addition function. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident within this code snippet.",
