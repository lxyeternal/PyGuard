  "sources": "Import statement for 'pytest' and 'add' from 'package_346234293'.",
  "sinks": "Assertions that verify the output of 'add' function; no untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Input values (1, 2), (-1, 1), and (0, 0) passed to 'add' function; outputs are checked via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward pytest-based test suite for a simple addition function. It imports the testing library and the function under test, then performs assertions to verify correctness. No user input, network access, or sensitive data handling is present. No suspicious or malicious code segments detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard unit testing without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for a testing environment.",
