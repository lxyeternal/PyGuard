  "sources": "Import statement importing 'pytest' and 'add' from 'package_346234293'.",
  "sinks": "Assertions testing the 'add' function's output.",
  "flows": "Input values (1, 2), (-1, 1), and (0, 0) flow into the 'add' function; results are checked via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code is straightforward and typical for a test script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pytest framework and the 'add' function from a package with a numeric identifier. It defines a test case that asserts the correct functionality of the 'add' function with simple input values. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard unit test, with no suspicious logic or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic unit test for a function and contains no malicious or security-threatening code. It performs standard testing procedures with no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
