  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that customizes installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The custom run() method in CustomInstallCommand class, specifically subprocess.check_output() calls executing system commands.",
  "sinks": "System commands that interact with the filesystem and system information, such as 'touch /tmp/pwn', 'cat /etc/hostname', and 'ls -al'.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the run() method executes, executing commands that create a file, read system hostname, and list directory contents.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of system commands ('touch /tmp/pwn', 'cat /etc/hostname', 'ls -al') during installation is suspicious; these could be used to gather system info or cause side effects. The print statements output command results but are not inherently malicious, yet their presence during install indicates potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that overrides the default install process. During installation, it prints a message and executes system commands that create a file, read system hostname, and list directory contents. The commands can be used for reconnaissance or to cause side effects on the system. These actions are unusual for a typical setup script and indicate a potential backdoor or malicious behavior. The commands executed are not malicious per se but their execution during package install without user consent is suspicious and could be leveraged for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior in the form of executing system commands during package installation, which could be used for reconnaissance or malicious side effects. This behavior is suspicious and indicates a potential security risk. The overall intent appears malicious or at least suspicious, warranting caution.",
