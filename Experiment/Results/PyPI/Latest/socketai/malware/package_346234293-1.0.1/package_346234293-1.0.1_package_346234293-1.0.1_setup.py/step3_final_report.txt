{
  "purpose": "The code executes system commands during package installation, including creating a file, reading system hostname, and listing directory contents, which are suspicious behaviors indicative of reconnaissance or malicious setup activities.",
  "sources": "Unconditional execution of subprocess.check_output() calls within the run() method of CustomInstallCommand during setup",
  "sinks": "System commands executed via subprocess during install; outputs are printed, but commands could be used for system info gathering or backdoor setup",
  "flows": "Code execution flow starts at run(), executes commands (touch /tmp/pwn, cat /etc/hostname, ls -al), outputs printed, then proceeds with standard installation",
  "anomalies": "Execution of system commands during package setup without sanitization, unconditionally, and creating a marker file (/tmp/pwn) suggest malicious reconnaissance or backdoor activity",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that runs multiple system commands during package installation, which is highly unusual and suspicious. The commands include creating a file, reading hostname info, and listing directory contents, all unconditionally. This behavior can be used for reconnaissance, establishing backdoors, or system manipulation. The commands are straightforward, not obfuscated, and executed without validation. The reports correctly identify this as suspicious, assigning high malware (0.9) and security risk (0.9) scores, justified by the potential malicious intent. The confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9). The behavior aligns with malicious activity, warranting caution and flagging the package as highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious-like behavior by executing system commands during installation, indicative of reconnaissance or backdoor setup. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious, and such behavior warrants strict review or avoidance.",
