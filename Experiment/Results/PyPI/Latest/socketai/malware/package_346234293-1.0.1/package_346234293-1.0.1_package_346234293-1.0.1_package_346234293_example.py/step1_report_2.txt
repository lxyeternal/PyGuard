{
  "purpose": "Define functions with an 'evil' decorator that adds a print statement upon invocation, wrapping basic math operations.",
  "sources": "Function calls to 'add' and 'cos' which are decorated by 'evil_function'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks leading to data leaks or harmful actions; print statement is benign.",
  "flows": "Calls to 'add' or 'cos' pass through the 'evil_function' wrapper, which outputs a message before executing the original function.",
  "anomalies": "The decorator is named 'evil_function' and prints a message indicating malicious intent; however, it does not perform any malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator named 'evil_function' that wraps the 'add' and 'cos' functions. When these functions are invoked, a message 'Evil function called!' is printed, but the functions perform their normal operations. The naming and message suggest malicious intent, but functionally, the code only logs calls and does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration. There are no suspicious behaviors like network access, data leaks, or malicious modifications. The code appears to be intentionally deceptive in naming but does not contain malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The 'evil_function' decorator is used for logging purposes only. The overall security risk is minimal, as there are no harmful actions performed.",
