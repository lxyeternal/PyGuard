{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator that wraps functions with an additional print statement, then applies this decorator to two mathematical functions (add and cos).",
  "sources": "Function definitions and the decorator application; no external data sources or input reads.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "The decorator adds a print statement when the functions are called, but does not alter the core logic or data flow significantly.",
  "anomalies": "The 'evil_function' decorator is suspiciously named, and its purpose seems to be to log or mark function calls. However, it does not perform any malicious actions like data exfiltration, code injection, or network activity. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a simple wrapper decorator that prints a message each time the decorated functions are called. The functions 'add' and 'cos' are straightforward mathematical functions from the math library, decorated with 'evil_function'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data theft, network communication, or obfuscation. The naming of the decorator ('evil_function') is potentially misleading but does not by itself indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign, with no security risks or malware observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is not malicious; it only logs calls to specific functions with a print statement. The decorator name is suspicious but does not correspond to malicious behavior. There are no security risks or malware present.",
