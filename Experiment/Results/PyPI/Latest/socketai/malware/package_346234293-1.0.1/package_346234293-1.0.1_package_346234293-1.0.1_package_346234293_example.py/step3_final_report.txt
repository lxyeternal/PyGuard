{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator that logs a message before executing functions, applied to simple mathematical functions.",
  "sources": "The decorator 'evil_function' wrapping 'add' and 'cos' functions.",
  "sinks": "The print statement in the decorator; no data leaks or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "The decorator intercepts function calls, printing a message before executing the original functions.",
  "anomalies": "The decorator's name 'evil_function' and message 'Evil function called!' are suspicious and misleading, but do not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with a benign decorator that logs calls. No malicious payloads, network activity, or harmful system modifications are present. The naming and message are suspicious but only produce output without harm. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign behavior. The suspicion stems solely from misleading naming, not actual malicious intent. Overall, the code is harmless but potentially misleading if misused in a larger context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with misleading naming that could be used for obfuscation or playful deception. No malicious activity is present. The current low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, with a minimal security risk score (~0.1) reflecting suspicion due to naming. No adjustments are necessary.",
