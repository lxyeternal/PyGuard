  "purpose": "Define functions with an 'evil' wrapper that prints a message before executing the original functions.",
  "sources": "Function definitions and decorator application.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to 'add' and 'cos', which execute normal operations.",
  "flows": "Calling 'add' or 'cos' triggers the 'evil_function' wrapper, which prints a message and then calls the original function.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a decorator named 'evil_function' that outputs a message indicating malicious intent, but only prints text and does not perform harmful actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'evil_function' that wraps other functions to add a print statement. It applies this decorator to 'add' and 'cos'. The wrapper simply prints 'Evil function called!' each time the functions are invoked. There is no malicious activity such as data exfiltration, system modification, or harmful network behavior. The naming ('evil_function') and print statement could suggest malicious intent, but functionally, the code only outputs a message and proceeds with normal calculations. The code appears to be intentionally misleading or humorous rather than malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It merely wraps functions with a decorator that prints a message, which is harmless. The use of 'evil' in naming is likely meant as a joke or for illustrative purposes.",
