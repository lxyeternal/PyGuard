{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator that prints a message and applies it to functions for addition and cosine calculation.",
  "sources": "Function definitions, decorator application",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input leading to data leak or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Decorator wraps the add and cos functions, executing print statement before calling original functions",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a decorator that adds a print statement labeled as 'Evil function' without any malicious payload, but the naming could suggest malicious intent. No actual malicious activity or harmful behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces a decorator 'evil_function' which outputs a message before invoking the wrapped function. The functions 'add' and 'cos' are decorated with it. No external data input, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The print statement may be intended to simulate malicious activity or obfuscate, but it does not execute any harmful operations. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code flow detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign example of function decoration with a humorous or suspicious label. There is no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks identified. The 'evil_function' does not perform any harmful operations; it only prints a message. Overall, the code is safe but may be intended as a demonstration or a joke.",
