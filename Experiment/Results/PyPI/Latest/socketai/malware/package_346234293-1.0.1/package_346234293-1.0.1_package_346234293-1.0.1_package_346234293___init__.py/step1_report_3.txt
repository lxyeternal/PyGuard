{
  "purpose": "This module appears to import functions 'add' and 'cos' from a local module named 'example' and prints a message indicating execution of code in an __init__.py file.",
  "sources": "The source of input/data is the module import statement, which loads code from a local file 'example'. The print statement also executes during import.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to the console; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Code executes upon import, with data flowing from the import statement (loading code from 'example') and the print statement to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable feature is the printed message 'evil code execution in __init__.py', which appears suspiciously self-deprecating or possibly malicious. There are no other anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a local module and prints a message indicating execution. The message itself is unusual but does not constitute malicious activity. There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The import may have security implications if 'example' is malicious, but based solely on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard import and print operations, with an unusual message that may be a placeholder or an indicator of test code. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this snippet.",
