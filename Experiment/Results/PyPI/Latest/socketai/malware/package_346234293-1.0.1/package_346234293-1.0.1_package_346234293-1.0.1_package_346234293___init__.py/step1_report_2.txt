  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment 'evil code execution' which appears to be sarcastic or misleading, but no actual malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a local module and outputs a print statement. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious operations. The comment about 'evil code execution' seems to be a joke or placeholder rather than an indication of malicious intent. The code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The comment may be misleading but does not reflect actual malicious behavior.",
