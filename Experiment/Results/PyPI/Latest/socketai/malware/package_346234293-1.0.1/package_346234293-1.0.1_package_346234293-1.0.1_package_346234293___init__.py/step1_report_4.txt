  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions from a local module and prints a message indicating code execution.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .example import add, cos",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to the console; no other sinks are present",
  "flows": "Imported functions are not used further; the print statement executes normally, with no data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "The print statement explicitly states 'evil code execution,' which appears suspiciously intended as a joke or misdirection; no actual malicious behavior is present",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions add and cos from a local module, which is standard practice. The print statement outputs a message indicating 'evil code execution,' which could be intended as humorous or misleading. No data is read from external sources, nor are there any functions or code that perform malicious actions such as network communication, file modifications, or data exfiltration. The message seems to be a placeholder or a joke, not evidence of malicious intent. There are no obfuscated elements, backdoors, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be a placeholder or joke message without malicious intent or security risks.",
