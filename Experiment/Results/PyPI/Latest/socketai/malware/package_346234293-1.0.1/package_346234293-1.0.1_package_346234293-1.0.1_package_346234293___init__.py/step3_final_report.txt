{
  "purpose": "This code imports functions from a local module and prints a misleading message indicating malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .example module, print statement output",
  "sinks": "Console output (print), no external data or network activity",
  "flows": "Static import and print; no untrusted data flow or external sinks",
  "anomalies": "The message \"evil code execution in __init__.py\" is suspicious and potentially misleading but not operationally malicious",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and outputs a message. The message suggests malicious intent but appears to be a joke or placeholder. No network activity, data leaks, or code execution beyond standard import and print. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk near zero, obfuscated=0) are consistent with benign code. The suspicion arises solely from the message, not from actual malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign; the message is misleading but not indicative of malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate and should be maintained. The risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to the misleading message.",
