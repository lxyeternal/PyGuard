{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a module and imports functions 'add' and 'cos' from a local example module, then prints a message indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The print statement at the end acts as an output source.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The source (print) outputs a message indicating execution of malicious intent, but there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The message 'evil code execution in __init__.py' explicitly suggests malicious intent or at least an attempt to deceive, but the code itself is minimal and simple. The print statement is unusual if the code's purpose is purely functional.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a local module and then prints a suspicious message implying malicious activity. The import statements are standard and harmless by themselves. The printed message is unusual and may be a hint or joke, but it does not execute any malicious behavior. There are no external data sources, no network connections, or other typical malicious behaviors. The code is minimal and could be used as a placeholder or for testing. Overall, the code does not perform any malicious actions but hints at malicious intent through its message.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no actual malicious behavior but explicitly indicates malicious intent through the printed message. It appears more as a placeholder or joke rather than functional malicious code. No security risks are present beyond the misleading message.",
