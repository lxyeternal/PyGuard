{
  "purpose": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'web2' with a custom install command that conditionally executes encrypted code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, environment variables (os.name), and imports modules (requests, fernet, os). It also accesses a hardcoded encrypted string and decrypts it during the install process.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decrypted code via exec(), which can run arbitrary code within the environment. No other obvious sinks are present.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the flow involves reading environment info, then decrypting and executing embedded code via Fernet, which could perform malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated and nonsensical long strings for description and author info. The class name is also nonsensical. The use of exec() on decrypted content is suspicious, especially since the decrypted code is not visible and is encrypted, indicating possible malicious payload.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, when run on Windows, imports requests and Fernet, decrypts an encrypted string, and executes it dynamically. This is a common pattern for hiding malicious payloads, such as backdoors or remote code execution. The encrypted string is hardcoded, and the code relies on the presence of 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, which are declared as setup requirements. The overall structure appears designed to conceal malicious activity, especially given the obfuscated strings and execution of decrypted code without visibility into its content.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious potential due to the use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution during installation, which can lead to arbitrary code execution and compromise. The obfuscated strings and conditional execution on Windows are suspicious. This package should be considered malicious or at least highly risky without further analysis of the decrypted payload.",
