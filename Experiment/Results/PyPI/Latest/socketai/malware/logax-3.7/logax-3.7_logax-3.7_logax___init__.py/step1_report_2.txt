{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'info'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'info' module from the current package or directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from this single import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement is straightforward; no unusual syntax or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a relative import from a module named 'info'. This is a common Python pattern for importing local modules within a package. No code execution, data handling, or network activity is involved. Since the code is minimal and standard, there are no signs of malicious behavior. However, the 'info' module's content is unknown, which could contain malicious code, but that cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a simple module import, which is normal in Python packages.",
