  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly defined in this fragment",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can hide malicious code within the imported module, but no direct malicious code is visible here",
  "analysis": "The code simply performs a local import of all contents from the 'info' module. Without inspecting the 'info' module itself, it's impossible to determine if malicious code exists. The import statement itself is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. No other code or data handling is present to evaluate for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The potential security concern depends entirely on the contents of the 'info' module, which is not provided. Therefore, the code fragment itself appears benign, but further review of 'info' is necessary.",
