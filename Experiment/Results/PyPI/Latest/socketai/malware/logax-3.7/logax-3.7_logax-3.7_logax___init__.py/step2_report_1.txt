  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings, scores, and reasoning.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports analyze the same code: `from .info import *`.\n- The core concern is the use of `import *`, which can obscure imported contents and potentially hide malicious code.\n- None of the reports provide the content of the `info` module, so the actual risk depends on its contents.\n- The code snippet itself is benign: a simple relative import statement with no direct malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code is syntactically correct and performs a standard import.\n- No direct malicious behavior is observable from this line alone.\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues are directly present in the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- All reports correctly identify that the import is from a local module.\n- They acknowledge that `import *` can be risky but do not claim it is malicious by itself.\n- Some reports assign confidence scores that seem somewhat inconsistent with the benign nature of the code (e.g., confidence of 0.4 or 0.6).\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent in their reasoning, emphasizing that the risk depends on the `info` module's content.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis that the code itself is not malicious.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is reasonable since the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk scores:** Range from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minor concern due to `import *`.\n\n**Suggestion:** Given the code alone, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk could be slightly higher if the imported module is untrusted, but since no evidence suggests malicious intent, scores of 0.1–0.2 are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports correctly state that the risk hinges on the `info` module's content, which is unknown.\n- No report claims that the import line itself is malicious, only that it could be risky if the module is compromised.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the reasoning provided.\n- The confidence scores vary but are generally moderate, reflecting uncertainty about the module's contents.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is benign in isolation.\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which can be problematic if the imported module is malicious or contains malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (small risk due to `import *`, but no evidence)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code itself is benign.\n- The security concern depends entirely on the `info` module's contents.\n- The current scores are reasonable, but given the lack of context, I would keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and the security risk at around 0.1.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code snippet is safe, but caution should be exercised if the `info` module is from an untrusted source.",
