  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their accuracy, the scoring, and any potential issues.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple relative import statement: `from .info import *`.\n- They consistently note that this pattern alone does not indicate malicious behavior.\n- They correctly identify that the actual risk depends on the contents of the 'info' module, which is not provided.\n- The use of `import *` is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution and potential obfuscation, but it is not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code is just an import statement; there are no observable malicious actions, data flows, or external communications in this snippet.\n- The 'import *' pattern can be risky if the imported module contains malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Accuracy of analysis:** All reports correctly state that the import statement itself is benign but highlight the potential risks associated with `import *`.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the limited context.\n  - Security risk scores vary between 0.1 and 0.2, which seems reasonable considering the use of `import *`.\n  - Confidence levels range from 0.4 to 0.8; higher confidence in the absence of malicious behavior is justified.\n- **Potential inconsistency:** Report 1 has a confidence of 0.6, while Report 2 has 0.8, despite similar reasoning. This is acceptable but could be standardized.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- The risk scores are mostly below 0.3, which is reasonable because the code is minimal and standard.\n- The highest risk score is 0.2, which aligns with the cautious stance about `import *`.\n\n### Malware score:\n- All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports appropriately state that without inspecting the 'info' module, malicious content cannot be ruled out.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are made about malicious intent; the analysis remains cautious and accurate.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The caution about `import *` is justified but does not warrant a high risk or malware score unless further context indicates malicious content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (nothing indicates obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (use of `import *` warrants mild caution but is not inherently dangerous)\n\n**Overall,** the code snippet is benign, but the use of `import *` should be flagged for review of the 'info' module contents in a real security audit.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and cautious.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed unless additional context about 'info' is provided.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions, emphasizing that the security concern hinges on the 'info' module's content, which is not available here.",
