{
  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from the 'info' module within the same package, likely for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module ('info')",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; merely a package import statement",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' can be considered a coding anomaly, as it reduces clarity and may hide malicious or unintended behavior if the imported module contains malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing all definitions from the 'info' module within the same package. This pattern alone does not indicate malicious intent. However, the use of 'import *' is discouraged because it obscures the namespace and can inadvertently include malicious or unwanted code if the 'info' module is compromised. There are no direct data flows, external communications, or suspicious operations in this line. Without examining the 'info' module itself, it is not possible to determine if it contains malicious code. Overall, this code snippet is minimal and typical for Python projects, with no explicit malicious or security-related behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple package import statement with no inherent malicious behavior. The use of 'import *' warrants caution but is not suspicious by itself. No malware or security risks are evident from this single line. Further review of the 'info' module would be needed to rule out malicious content within it.",
