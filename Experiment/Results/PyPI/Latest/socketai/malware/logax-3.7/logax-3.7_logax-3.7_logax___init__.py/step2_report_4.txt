  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the issues, reasoning, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .info import *`.\n- They correctly identify that this is a relative import of all symbols from the 'info' module.\n- None of the reports provide the contents of 'info', so the actual risk depends on that module.\n- The primary concern raised is the use of `import *`, which can obscure malicious code if 'info' is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues in the code:\n\n- The code **does** perform a relative import of all contents from 'info'.\n- **No** malicious behavior or code execution is observable from this line alone.\n- **No** data flows, sinks, or external communications are present here.\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reported issues are accurate; the code itself is benign but potentially risky depending on 'info'.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- The reports generally avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge that malicious activity depends on 'info'.\n- They correctly note that 'import *' reduces clarity and can hide malicious code.\n- **No significant logical flaws** are present in the reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Score review and suggestions:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\n- All reports assign **malware = 0**, which is appropriate given the code.\n- **Obfuscated** scores are 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk scores** vary between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero concern due to the use of `import *`.\n\n**Suggestion:** Since the code is minimal and standard, a risk score of **0.1** or **0.2** is reasonable. The lowest (0.1) might be more appropriate unless the context indicates a higher threat.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- The scores are all well below 0.5, indicating low risk.\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged but not inherently dangerous.\n- Without knowledge of 'info', no malicious activity can be confirmed.\n\n**Conclusion:** No scores should be higher than 0.2 based on this snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency with the reports:\n\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment.\n- The scores align with the analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, low risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (I recommend 0.1 for minimal risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code performs a simple relative import.\n- No malicious activity is evident from this line.\n- The primary concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious code if 'info' is compromised.\n- The scores in the reports are reasonable, but I suggest slightly lowering the risk score to **0.1** for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThis reflects a benign code snippet with a minor caution due to coding style rather than security threat.",
