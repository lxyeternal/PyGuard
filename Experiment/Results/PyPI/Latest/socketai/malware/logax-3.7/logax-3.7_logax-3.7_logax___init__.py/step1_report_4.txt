{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a module named 'info' within the same package, likely for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'info' module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks for untrusted data or operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this single import statement; it only imports symbols from 'info'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; it uses a relative import, which could sometimes be misused to obfuscate code, but on its own, it appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement importing all symbols from the 'info' module. No other code, data handling, or logic is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The import itself is a common Python practice, though using 'import *' is generally discouraged for clarity, not for malicious intent. Since no additional code or context is provided, the snippet appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is minimal and appears standard, with no harmful actions detected.",
