{
  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'info' to the current namespace.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'info' module located relative to this file.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink or data output/transfer points present in this single line.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible from this single import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure imported contents, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code, but the line itself does not execute code.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a relative import from a module named 'info'. There is no malicious behavior directly observable. However, 'import *' can be risky if 'info' contains malicious code or hidden backdoors, but that cannot be determined from this line alone. No other context or code is provided to analyze further.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple relative import. While 'import *' is generally discouraged for clarity and safety, this line alone does not indicate malicious activity. Additional context is needed to evaluate the contents of 'info'.",
