  "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign; the main security concern hinges on the contents of 'info'. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but not inherently malicious. Current scores are appropriate; the overall security risk remains low, with a slight caution due to potential hidden malicious code within 'info'."
