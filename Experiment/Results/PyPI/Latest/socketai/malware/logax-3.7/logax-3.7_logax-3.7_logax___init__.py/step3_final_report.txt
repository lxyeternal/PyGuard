  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of the import statement 'from .info import *' in the context of supply chain security for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; the 'info' module being imported.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported symbols that could execute malicious code or cause unintended behavior if 'info' is compromised.",
  "flows": "Importing all symbols from 'info' into the current namespace, which could include malicious definitions or functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *', which reduces code clarity and can hide malicious or unintended code within 'info'. No content of 'info' provided, so actual risk cannot be fully assessed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from the 'info' module. No malicious behavior or code execution occurs in this line directly. The primary concern is that 'import *' can obscure imported contents, potentially hiding malicious code if 'info' is compromised. All reports correctly identify that the risk depends on the contents of 'info'. Malware scores are appropriately zero, and obfuscated scores are zero, reflecting straightforward code. Risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), consistent with minimal code but acknowledging the potential risk if 'info' is malicious. Confidence levels are moderate to high, given the lack of 'info' content. Overall, the code is benign in isolation, but caution is advised if 'info' is from an untrusted source.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign; the main security concern hinges on the contents of 'info'. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but not inherently malicious. Current scores are appropriate; the overall security risk remains low, with a slight caution due to potential hidden malicious code within 'info'.",
