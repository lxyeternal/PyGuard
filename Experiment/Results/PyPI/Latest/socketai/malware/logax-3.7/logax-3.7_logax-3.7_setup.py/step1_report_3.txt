{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'logax', including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description; uses 'find_packages()' to identify packages; specifies dependencies via 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is processed or executed in a way that can cause harm.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and defines package metadata; no untrusted data flows to potentially dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations for a Python package. It reads a README file for long description, configures package metadata, and specifies dependencies. All operations are typical for Python package distribution. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution. The code does not process or execute untrusted input, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
