  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library called 'logax' with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, obtaining package information, dependencies, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code primarily sets metadata and dependencies for package distribution.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> setting package metadata -> installing dependencies; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. No malicious behavior or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures using setuptools, reading a markdown file for description, defining package info, URLs, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are typical for a setup.py file. No suspicious code, obfuscated segments, or malicious logic detected. The dependencies are benign (requests), and the URLs point to legitimate repositories.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
