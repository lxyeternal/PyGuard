{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, collects system information and makes network requests to external URLs, including an open API and two webhooks, ostensibly for data collection or tracking purposes.",
  "sources": "Requests to external APIs (https://pokeapi.co and webhook URLs), system information retrieval (hostname, user, platform, CPU, memory, etc.), environment variables (via sys, platform, getpass, site, psutil).",
  "sinks": "Requests to external webhooks and URLs that send collected data, notably requests.post to Webhook.site and requests.get to Burp Collaborator URL with system info as parameters.",
  "flows": "During installation, system info is gathered and sent via POST to Webhook.site and via GET to Burp Collaborator URL, originating from the code execution during setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during package installation without user consent, sending system data to third-party URLs. It fetches data from a public API (PokeAPI) but uses the data only internally, which is benign in isolation. The primary concern is the unsolicited sending of system information to external servers during setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and third-party libraries, including requests and psutil, and overrides the install command to execute additional code during package installation. It fetches data from a public API (PokeAPI), then collects detailed system information including hostname, current directory, user, OS details, CPU, RAM, Python version, and site-packages directory. This data is sent to external URLs via HTTP requests without user knowledge or consent. The data exfiltration during installation poses privacy and security risks. There are no signs of code obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads beyond data collection. The requests to external URLs and the use of system info for network requests suggest potentially malicious intent, primarily for user tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized data exfiltration by sending detailed system information to external servers during package installation. While it does not contain payloads like reverse shells or file damage, its behavior aligns with tracking or reconnaissance activities. This behavior is malicious in the context of supply chain security, as it secretly collects user data without consent.",
