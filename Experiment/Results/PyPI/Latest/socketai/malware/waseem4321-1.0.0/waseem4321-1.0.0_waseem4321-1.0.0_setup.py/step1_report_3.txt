{
  "purpose": "Custom installation script that fetches data from an external API and sends system information to two remote endpoints during package installation.",
  "sources": "Requests to external APIs (https://pokeapi.co, https://webhook.site, and Burp Collaborator URL), reading system information (hostname, user, OS details, Python version, memory, CPU info).",
  "sinks": "Requests POST and GET to remote URLs with collected system data; potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "On install, fetch data from PokeAPI → collect system info → send info via POST to Webhook.site → send info via GET to Burp URL.",
  "anomalies": "Code performs network requests during package installation, which is unusual; no user consent prompts; sends detailed system info without apparent user awareness.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon execution, fetches data from a public API and immediately transmits detailed system information to external servers. This behavior occurs silently during package installation, which is suspicious. The data includes hostname, user, OS, hardware specs, Python environment, and API response data. The use of external network calls in a setup routine is unusual and may be used for tracking, reconnaissance, or malicious data exfiltration. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious system modifications are observed, but the network activity and data collection are potentially malicious in intent, especially if used without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unexpected and potentially malicious actions by collecting detailed system information and transmitting it to remote servers during package installation. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking, which is suspicious in a package distribution context. While no direct malware (like system damage or backdoors) is present, the network activity and data collection pose security and privacy risks.",
