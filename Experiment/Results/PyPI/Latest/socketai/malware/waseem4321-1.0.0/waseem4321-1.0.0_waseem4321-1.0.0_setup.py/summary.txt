  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during package installation, transmitting sensitive system information to external servers without user consent. While lacking destructive payloads, this activity is highly suspicious and warrants classification as malicious or highly risky. The scores provided are consistent with this assessment, and the behavior justifies high malware and security risk ratings."
