It fetches data from a public API (PokeAPI) and then compiles comprehensive system information including hostname, current directory, user, platform details, CPU, RAM, Python version, and site-packages directory. It then sends this data to external URLs, specifically a webhook and a Burp Collaborator server, without any user approval or obvious legitimate purpose. The network requests occur immediately after a successful API fetch, indicating possible data exfiltration behavior. The script’s structure and behavior are unusual for a setup script, which typically only handles package configuration. The data collection and network communication suggest malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior, especially considering the lack of transparency.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"This code exhibits potentially malicious behavior by collecting detailed system information and transmitting it to external servers during package installation. While the network requests themselves are straightforward, their purpose appears to be data exfiltration, which is inappropriate in a setup context. The script's behavior is suspicious and warrants further scrutiny for malicious intent.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0.75,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.8\n}",
