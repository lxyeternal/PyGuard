{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process to fetch data from an external API and send system information to specified webhooks, likely for data collection or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs: 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/charizard', 'https://webhook.site/...', and 'https://n8w9opnzx5tsdu9ypgkn8ftjnat3ht5i.oastify.com'. System information gathered via socket, os, getpass, platform, psutil, and sys modules.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external webhooks and URLs with system data, potential for data exfiltration; gathering system info like hostname, user, platform, CPU, RAM, and Python environment.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system and external API flows into JSON payloads sent via POST and GET requests to external URLs, potentially enabling remote data collection or tracking.",
  "anomalies": "Code performs silent data exfiltration of detailed system information during installation without user consent; uses third-party services possibly for malicious data collection; no explicit user notification or permission handling.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to perform additional network requests during package installation. It fetches data from a public API (PokeAPI) and then sends extensive system information to two external URLs (Webhook.site and Burp Collaborator), which can be used for reconnaissance or malicious data collection. The data sent includes hostname, current directory, username, system specs, Python version, and API data, which could be sensitive. No input validation or user consent mechanisms are present. The network requests are embedded directly into the install process, which is suspicious behavior, especially in open-source packages meant for distribution. The code does not perform any harmful actions like file modification or code execution, but it leaks system data to external servers without any warning or explicit permission. The usage of external tracking/webhook services during install constitutes malicious or at least highly intrusive behavior, likely for surveillance or exploitation.",
  "conclusion": "The package secretly collects detailed system information during installation and sends it to external servers without user consent, which is malicious behavior. Although it does not execute destructive code, its covert data exfiltration is highly suspicious and constitutes malicious intent.",
