  "purpose": "The code collects system information and fetches data from an external API during package installation, then exfiltrates this data to external servers without user consent.",

  "sinks": "requests.post() to Webhook.site URL, requests.get() to Burp Collaborator URL with system info as parameters",
  "flows": "Source: API fetch and system info collection -> Sink: POST/GET requests to external URLs during setup",
  "anomalies": "Network requests to external servers during package installation without user notification, collection of extensive system info, no user consent, no obfuscation, no payloads or destructive code",
  "analysis": "The code performs network requests to external URLs during setup, collecting detailed system information and sending it without user awareness. It fetches data from a public API but primarily exfiltrates system data to external servers, indicating covert data collection. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads, but the behavior resembles surveillance or data harvesting. The network activity during installation is suspicious and not typical for standard setup scripts. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.75, security risk around 0.8) are justified given the covert exfiltration activity. The code's behavior aligns with malicious intent, primarily for privacy invasion and potential reconnaissance, warranting high concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during package installation, transmitting sensitive system information to external servers without user consent. While lacking destructive payloads, this activity is highly suspicious and warrants classification as malicious or highly risky. The scores provided are consistent with this assessment, and the behavior justifies high malware and security risk ratings.",
