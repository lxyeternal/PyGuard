  "purpose": "Analyze Python package code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on source-to-sink data flows and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include network inputs, environment variables, user inputs, and file reads.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are network transmissions, file writes, environment modifications, and dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, especially where untrusted data influences network or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code segments, dynamic execution, hardcoded strings, or suspicious network activity are anomalies; in this case, obfuscation and dynamic code are notable.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits no malicious patterns in most reports, with benign data processing and network operations. Report 4 shows obfuscation and dynamic code, raising suspicion. Scores are consistent with observations: benign reports have zero malware and obfuscation scores, while Report 4's elevated scores reflect its suspicious nature. Confidence levels align with the clarity of code. No evidence of malicious payloads or security vulnerabilities outside the code context is present.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; Report 4 indicates moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution. Scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. Overall threat level is low, with specific attention needed for obfuscated segments in Report 4.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "malware": 0.2,
  "securityRisk": 0.3,
