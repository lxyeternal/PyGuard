  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be intended for data processing or utility functions based on the variable names and functions present.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources if present. Specific source points are not explicitly provided in the fragment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission points, file write operations, or printing/logging functions, if present. No explicit sinks are identified without further context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (outputs, network, storage), passing through processing functions. Specific source-to-sink paths are not fully detailed in the provided fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are explicitly visible. No backdoors, hidden code, or malicious strings are apparent. No suspicious network or system calls are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, with normal usage of functions, variables, and control flow. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code patterns, or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network attacks. The code's structure is straightforward, and no anomalies are observed that suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The code seems benign, with no malicious intent or malicious patterns detected.",
