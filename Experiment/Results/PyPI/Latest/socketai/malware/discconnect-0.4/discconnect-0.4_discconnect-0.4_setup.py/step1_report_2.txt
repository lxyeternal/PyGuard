  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to download and execute an external executable file during setup.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://filetransfer.io/data-package/MG85ggQt/download' from which the executable is downloaded.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file is saved to the local app data directory and immediately executed using WinExec.",
  "flows": "Download request from URL -> save to environment-specified path -> execute the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from an external URL during setup and executes it without validation, which is suspicious. Use of WinExec to run the file is potentially malicious. No validation, signature checking, or user confirmation is performed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, when run, downloads a file from an external URL and executes it immediately. It uses urllib.request with a custom user-agent to fetch the file and saves it as 'Driver.exe' in the local app data directory. The use of 'ctypes.windll.kernel32.WinExec' to run the downloaded file indicates malicious intent, especially since this happens during setup without any user consent or validation. The URL is obscure, and no checks are in place to verify the integrity or authenticity of the downloaded file. This pattern is characteristic of malware delivering malicious payloads via supply chain attack methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation, which could compromise the host system. This is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent.",
