  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external payload during installation without validation or user consent. This pattern is characteristic of malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The scores assigned (malware: 1, security risk: 1, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and justified. The package should be flagged as malicious and removed from distribution until reviewed and remediated."
