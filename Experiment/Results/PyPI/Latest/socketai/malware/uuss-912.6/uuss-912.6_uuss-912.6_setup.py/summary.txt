  "conclusion": "The setup script's behavior of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious. The pattern of running arbitrary code at install time poses a significant security risk, especially if 'main()' contains malicious code. The scores should be high, around 0.8 for malware and 0.8 for security risk, reflecting the high likelihood of malicious activity if 'main()' is malicious or compromised. This pattern should be flagged for further inspection of 'main.py' and the package's intent."
