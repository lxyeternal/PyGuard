      "conclusion": "The setup script's behavior of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious. The pattern of running arbitrary code at install time poses a significant security risk, especially if 'main()' contains malicious code. The scores should be high, around 0.8 for malware and 0.8 for security risk, reflecting the high likelihood of malicious activity if 'main()' is malicious or compromised. This pattern should be flagged for further inspection of 'main.py' and the package's intent."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a covert data exfiltration or tracking tool, transmitting system info to suspicious domains without user consent. While it does not contain malicious payloads, its behavior is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious. Malware scores should be increased to approximately 0.75 to accurately represent the threat level. The overall security risk is high, and the code should be flagged for further investigation or removal."
