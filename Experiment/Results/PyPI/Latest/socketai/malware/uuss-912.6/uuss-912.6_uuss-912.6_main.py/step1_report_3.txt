  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to remote URLs, possibly for tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd() - reading system hostname, username, and current directory.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() - sending data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, current directory) are encoded into URL parameters and sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple remote endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of multiple suspicious URLs with obfuscated or non-standard domains; sending system info without user consent; no clear user benefit or legitimate purpose; no validation or encryption of data.",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, and current working directory. It generates a random number and constructs URLs that include these details as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious due to their non-standard domains, suggesting possible command-and-control or data exfiltration servers. The code then makes HTTP GET requests to these URLs, transmitting system information potentially without user knowledge. No other malicious actions, such as file modification, privilege escalation, or persistence mechanisms, are present. The purpose seems to be tracking or exfiltration. The use of try-except blocks handles potential errors but does not mitigate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be used for collecting and transmitting system info to external, suspicious domains. It does not include overt malicious actions like code injection or destructive operations but does perform unauthorized data exfiltration, raising security concerns.",
