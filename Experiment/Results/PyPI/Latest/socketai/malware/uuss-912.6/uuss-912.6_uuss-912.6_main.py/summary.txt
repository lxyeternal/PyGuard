  "conclusion": "The code functions as a covert data exfiltration or tracking tool, transmitting system info to suspicious domains without user consent. While it does not contain malicious payloads, its behavior is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious. Malware scores should be increased to approximately 0.75 to accurately represent the threat level. The overall security risk is high, and the code should be flagged for further investigation or removal."
