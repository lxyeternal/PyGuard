  "anomalies": "Usage of multiple suspicious domains, sending system info including hostname, username, current directory, and a random number, without any apparent legitimate purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system-specific data such as hostname, username, and current directory, then constructs URLs to external servers. It sends this data via HTTP GET requests, with a random number parameter. The domains involved are unusual and potentially malicious, indicating tracking or data exfiltration intent. The use of exception handling suggests attempts to silently attempt contact without crashing. No input validation or user consent is present, and the code acts as a beacon or data collector. The URLs are suspicious and likely malicious. The code does not perform any malicious actions on the host system itself but exfiltrates data to external servers.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a data exfiltration or tracking component, sending system information to potentially malicious domains without user consent. No malicious payload or harmful system modifications are evident, but the behavior is suspicious and could be used for reconnaissance or privacy invasion.",
