  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current directory) -> URL with parameters -> HTTP GET request to external domains",
  "anomalies": "The code contacts multiple suspicious URLs, uses random numbers as query parameters, and gathers system info without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current directory, and generates a random number. It constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains with these parameters and sends GET requests. The use of external URLs with no clear purpose and gathering system info indicates potential data exfiltration. The code does not perform any validation, encryption, or user interaction, and logs responses. The URLs are not standard and seem designed for tracking or malicious purposes. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or complex logic, but the intent appears to be to secretly send system info to external servers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to silently gather system information and send it to suspicious external servers, indicating malicious intent or tracking activity. It does not appear to be benign and poses security and privacy risks.",
