{
  "purpose": "The code is a Python package for data processing, with no suspicious external sources or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, command-line arguments, files, or network sources; no suspicious or malicious data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, files, or network; no malicious sinks such as data exfiltration or system modification detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (environment, files, network) to outputs (console, files, network) without suspicious manipulation or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns observed; code appears straightforward and transparent.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals point to benign, standard data processing functions. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9-1). No suspicious flows or anomalies are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are conservative but justified given the minimal risk environment. Minor adjustments could lower the security risk score to 0, aligning more closely with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate, though the security risk could be conservatively lowered to 0 for a more accurate reflection of the code's safety.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
