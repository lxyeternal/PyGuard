  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package setup information including dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and dependencies for setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or external output are present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; standard setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard 'setuptools' functions to specify package name, version, dependencies, and package discovery. All code is typical for Python packaging and contains no dynamic code execution, obfuscated elements, or malicious patterns. There are no external data inputs, no network operations, and no code that manipulates untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python project. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration.",
