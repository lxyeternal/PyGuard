  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Code reads package name, version, and dependencies; uses find_packages() to discover sub-packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Package name appears obfuscated or auto-generated ('artifact-lab-3-package-736f752d'), which could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The only notable aspect is the package name, which looks obfuscated but does not execute any malicious actions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware scores of 0 and low obfuscation and risk scores. The package name's appearance warrants minimal concern but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security posture is very low risk, with no signs of sabotage or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with an obfuscated-looking package name that does not imply malicious activity. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the package can be considered safe for use.",
