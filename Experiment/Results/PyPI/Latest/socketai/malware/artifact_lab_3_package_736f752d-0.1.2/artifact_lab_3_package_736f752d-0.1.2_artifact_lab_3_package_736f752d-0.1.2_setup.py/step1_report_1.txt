  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup parameters for a Python package distribution.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters such as name, version, packages, and install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; standard package configuration code.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code uses standard setuptools functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools to define package metadata. It specifies a package name with a seemingly random suffix, a version, and dependencies. No dynamic code, user input, or network activity is present. The dependencies are standard (requests), with a specific version constraint, which is common and not suspicious. The code appears to be straightforward package setup code with no obfuscated or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears safe and standard.",
