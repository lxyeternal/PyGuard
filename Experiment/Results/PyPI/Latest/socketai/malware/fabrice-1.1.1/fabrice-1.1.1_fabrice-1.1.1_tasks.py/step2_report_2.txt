  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No explicit malicious code detected. The code mainly automates release tasks, with environment variable manipulations and some hardcoded secrets (passwords, gateway info).  \n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The report correctly notes the presence of hardcoded secrets and environment manipulations. It assigns a confidence of 0.7, which seems reasonable given the potential security implications.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code. Obfuscated is 0, which is correct. Risk score 0.4 is reasonable considering the secrets and environment manipulations.  \n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?**  \n  Not applicable; scores are consistent.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The report's reasoning is sound. No active malware, but security risks due to secrets.  \n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Hardcoded credentials ('sikrit', 'mypass', 'sudouser', 'admin') are present, which are security risks.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The report correctly identifies these secrets and notes they pose security concerns. It states no malicious code is present, which is accurate.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware score 0, appropriate. Risk score 0.4 matches the moderate security concern.  \n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?**  \n  Not warranted; scores are reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The analysis is appropriate. No malware, but insecure secrets.  \n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Hardcoded credentials ('env.password', 'env.gateway', 'env.user') and environment manipulations.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  Correctly identifies security risks but no evidence of active malicious activity.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware 0, consistent. Risk 0.45 is appropriate given the secrets.  \n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?**  \n  Not necessary.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Well-reasoned. No malware, but insecure practices.  \n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Hardcoded secrets ('sikrit', 'some-gateway', 'mypass') and environment manipulations.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The report notes these are security risks but no active malicious code.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware 0, appropriate. Risk 0.65 is slightly higher, but considering the secrets, it's justifiable.  \n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?**  \n  Yes, because of the secrets and potential for misuse if environment is compromised.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The reasoning aligns with the data.  \n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Hardcoded password ('sikrit') and gateway.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  Correctly notes these as security concerns but no malicious code.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware 0, appropriate. Risk 0.3, slightly lower, reflecting moderate concern.  \n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?**  \n  No.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Sound reasoning.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk Scores:** They range from 0.3 to 0.65, mainly driven by hardcoded secrets and environment manipulations, which are security concerns but not active malware.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent with reports)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation seen)  \n- **Risk:** Given the recurring presence of hardcoded secrets, environment manipulations, and potential for secrets exposure, I would set the overall risk score around **0.6**. This reflects moderate security concern due to secrets, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n**Final notes:**  \n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.  \n- The main security issue is the hardcoded secrets, which could be exploited if the code or environment is compromised.  \n- No evidence suggests active malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** ~0.6 (adjusted slightly upward from the reports' average to reflect consistent security concerns)",
