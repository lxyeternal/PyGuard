  "purpose": "Automation tasks for packaging, testing, documentation, and release processes in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, imported modules, hardcoded secrets (passwords, gateway info, credentials).",
  "sinks": "Command execution via c.run(), environment variable modifications, dynamic module imports, sys.path manipulation.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded secrets and environment variables influence command execution and environment setup.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded passwords ('sikrit', 'mypass'), gateway info, environment variable manipulations, dynamic imports, sys.path modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for build and release automation, with no evidence of malicious activity such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated malware. The main security concern is the presence of hardcoded secrets, which could lead to credential leaks if exposed. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected. The code structure is clear, and the secrets are directly embedded, indicating insecure practices but not active malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or obfuscation but exhibits insecure handling of secrets, posing a moderate security risk. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.5, reflecting the presence of hardcoded secrets without active malicious behavior.",
