  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application, specifically for signaling 'nothing to do', group errors, and missing environment data in Fabric 1.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definitions are static and serve as error indicators.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks; purely definitional classes.",
  "flows": "No data flows; exception classes are instantiated where errors occur but contain no data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with minimal logic and clear comments. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three custom exception classes with minimal logic, serving as error signals. There are no external data sources, network interactions, or dynamic code execution. The classes are standard and well-documented. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The comments suggest refactoring considerations but do not introduce any security concerns. The code's simplicity and purpose align with safe, conventional error handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent and appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
