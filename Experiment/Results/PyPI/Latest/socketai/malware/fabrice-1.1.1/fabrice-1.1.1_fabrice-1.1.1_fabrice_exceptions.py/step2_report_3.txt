  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the underlying code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:  \n   The code defines three custom exception classes:\n   - `NothingToDo`\n   - `GroupException`\n   - `InvalidV1Env`  \n   These are straightforward, standard Python exception classes with no logic beyond inheritance and documentation. There are no data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Elements or Obfuscation**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is purely for error handling, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The comments hint at refactoring considerations but do not introduce any suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Security Risks**:  \n   Given the nature of exception class definitions, they are inherently safe. They do not process external data, do not interact with external systems, and do not contain any code that could be exploited.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Security Risk**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Risk Score Consideration**:  \n   Since the code is purely definitional and contains no vulnerabilities, the risk score should be **0**. No part of the code warrants a higher score because it does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n6. **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Clear, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks present.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The reports are thorough and correctly identify the benign nature of this code.\n- No further action needed; the code is safe and standard.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThis code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
