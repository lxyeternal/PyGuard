  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data; it only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines exceptions without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class and exception definitions with comments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. These classes serve as error indicators within an application. There are no inputs, no data manipulation, and no external communications. No suspicious code structures, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The comments indicate intent to possibly move code elsewhere, but this does not affect security. Overall, the code is simple, standard, and does not pose any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only basic exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard and safe.",
