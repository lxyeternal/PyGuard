  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application, possibly related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are used or read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data is written to external systems, network, files, or other sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains only class definitions with no suspicious or unusual logic, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes with no additional logic or data handling. It uses standard Python practices for defining exceptions. No input/output, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. There is no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application structure for error handling.",
