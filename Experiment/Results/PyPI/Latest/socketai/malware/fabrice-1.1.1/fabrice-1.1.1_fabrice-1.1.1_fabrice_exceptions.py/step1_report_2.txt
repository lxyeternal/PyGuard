  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to task execution and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code only defines classes and exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions; no potential for data leakage or malicious data flow.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; code consists solely of class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs observed. The classes are standard exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes, which are common in Python for error handling. No external inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution present. No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or external calls are visible. No obfuscation, malware, or suspicious behavior detected. The purpose appears to be for error handling in a larger application context.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign and standard in nature, serving as custom exception definitions without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
