{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application, likely related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and exception raising points; no external input or data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns observed. The code is straightforward and only defines custom exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. They are used for error handling and do not perform any data processing, network communication, or file operations. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The comments indicate some refactoring considerations but do not introduce suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining exception classes for error handling with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard for a Python project.",
