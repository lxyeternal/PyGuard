  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a known pattern of version retrieval via exec(). No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The main concern is the potential for executing malicious code if '_version.py' is tampered with. The overall security risk is low, around 0.2, assuming the version file is trusted and validated."
