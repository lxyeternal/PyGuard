  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script configuring package name, version, dependencies, and entry points based on environment variables and directory structure.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', directory checks for 'fabric' and 'fabric2', and reading '_version.py' file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of '_version.py' via exec() to obtain version information.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and directory presence influence package configuration; version info is obtained by executing '_version.py'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on a local version file, which could execute malicious code if the file is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration with dynamic package naming and version retrieval. The primary security concern is the use of exec() to run '_version.py', which could be malicious if the file is tampered with. No network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors. The risk stems from executing external code without validation, but in controlled environments, this pattern is common. Overall, the code poses a low security risk with a potential vector if '_version.py' is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a known pattern of version retrieval via exec(). No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The main concern is the potential for executing malicious code if '_version.py' is tampered with. The overall security risk is low, around 0.2, assuming the version file is trusted and validated.",
