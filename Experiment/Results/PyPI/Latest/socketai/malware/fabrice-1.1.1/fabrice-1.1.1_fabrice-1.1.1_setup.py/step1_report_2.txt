{
  "purpose": "The script configures the setup process for the 'fabrice' Python package, determining package variants, reading version info, and setting up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', reads 'README.rst' file, reads '_version.py' within the package directory, and reads package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to potential data leaks or malicious effects; all data sources are either environment variables, local files, or hardcoded strings used for package configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences package name and binary name, version info is extracted via executing '_version.py', README content is read and formatted into long_description.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors detected. The code uses exec() to read version info but in a controlled, read-only manner from a local file. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup configurations. It dynamically sets package names based on environment variables and directory checks. It reads the version information by executing a local Python file, which is a common practice. The long description is assembled from a README file. All dependencies and entry points are statically defined and safe. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or harmful behaviors. The use of exec() is controlled and limited to reading version info from a local file, which is a typical pattern in setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows common patterns for package configuration without executing untrusted code or accessing sensitive data. The overall security risk is minimal.",
