  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing internal modules and exposing classes/functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules (_version, connection, runners, group, tasks, executor).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, typical for a package's __init__.py. It does not include dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, straightforward structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
