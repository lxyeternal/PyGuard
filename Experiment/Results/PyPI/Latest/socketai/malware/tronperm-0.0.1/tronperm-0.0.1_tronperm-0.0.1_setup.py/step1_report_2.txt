  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'tronperm' that specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file from the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Read the README.md content -> Use in 'long_description' parameter of setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and reads a local README file for package description. It specifies package details and dependencies securely. No suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious patterns observed. The only external interaction is fetching the README.md file locally, which is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or credential handling present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for Python package distribution.",
