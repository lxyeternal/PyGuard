{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'tronperm' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static string assignments for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or user input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup configuration uses static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools, reads a local README file for description, and defines package metadata including name, version, author, and dependencies. It does not perform any network communication, dynamic code execution, or include any suspicious logic. The only potential concern is the author email pointing to a potentially unusual domain, but it is not malicious by itself. Overall, this is a typical setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
