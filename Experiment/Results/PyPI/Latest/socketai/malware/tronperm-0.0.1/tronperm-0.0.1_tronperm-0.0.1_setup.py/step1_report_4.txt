  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'tronperm' Python library",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, reads package dependencies, and sets package metadata",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions; no external data sinks or network connections in the code",
  "flows": "Reads the README.md content (source) used as long_description (sink), no other data flows present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard setup procedures without unusual or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools for packaging. It reads a local README.md file to set the long_description, specifies package metadata such as name, version, author, and dependencies, and includes a link to the source repository. All operations are typical for Python package setup and do not involve any data manipulation or external data flow that could suggest malicious activity. There are no hardcoded credentials, external data sources, or network communications in this script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
