  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the actual code, and evaluate the scores assigned, especially focusing on malware, obfuscated code, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n- It reads a local `README.md` file for the long description.\n- It specifies package metadata (`name`, `version`, `author`, etc.) and dependencies (`requests`).\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The only URL is a placeholder GitHub link, which is not malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of code**: The code is straightforward and matches the description. No discrepancies.\n- **Malicious behavior**: None detected; all reports agree on this.\n- **Obfuscation**: None present.\n- **Security risks**: None evident.\n\n### Specific points on scores:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores of 0 or 0.5. Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns, **a malware score of 0** is appropriate.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or malicious intent.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The author email domain (`bankrau.com`) is unusual but not malicious by itself.\n- The placeholder URL in `project_urls` is typical for initial setup scripts.\n- No evidence of any malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Aspect             | Estimated Score | Justification                                                                                     |\n|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**       | **0**             | No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior detected.                         |\n| **Obfuscated**    | **0**             | No obfuscation or code hiding techniques present.                                              |\n| **Risk**          | **0**             | Standard setup script with no security risks.                                                   |\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical, benign Python package setup script. All reports are consistent in their assessments. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at **0**.  \n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or code changes, but based on the current static analysis, this code is safe.",
