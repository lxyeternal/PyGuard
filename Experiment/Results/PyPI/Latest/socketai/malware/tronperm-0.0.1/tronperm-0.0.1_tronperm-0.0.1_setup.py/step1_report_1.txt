  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'tronperm' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file from the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Reading local file 'README.md' during setup, then passing static metadata to setuptools.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools, reads a local README.md file for long description, and defines package metadata and dependencies. All operations are typical for a Python package setup script. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected, such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors. The 'install_requires' only lists 'requests' and no other potentially malicious packages are included. The source code appears to be a straightforward package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily reads a local file and configures package metadata. No anomalies, malware, or security threats identified.",
