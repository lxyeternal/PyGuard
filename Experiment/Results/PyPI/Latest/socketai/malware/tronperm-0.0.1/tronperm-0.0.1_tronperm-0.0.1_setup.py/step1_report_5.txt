{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'tronperm' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description; static package metadata (name, version, author, etc.); package dependencies ('requests'); URL configuration.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sink points such as untrusted input handling or data transmission.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md from filesystem as a source; static package setup information flows into setup() configuration without involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The URL in 'project_urls' is a generic GitHub link placeholder; no malicious URL or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup process, importing necessary modules, reading a README file for documentation, and configuring package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network communication is present. The URL is a placeholder and does not indicate malicious intent. The structure and content are typical for a Python package setup script. No suspicious or malicious code segments are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a conventional Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
