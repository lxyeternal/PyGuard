  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'tronperm' library.",
  "sources": "Reading local README.md file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setup() call with metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file for the long description and defines package metadata including name, version, author, email, license, URL, and dependencies. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The author email domain and URL are placeholders or non-standard but not malicious. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware, obfuscated, and security risk as 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or obfuscated content. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
