{
  "purpose": "This code imports the symbol 'perm' from a local module 'main', serving as a module import statement within a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the source; it reads the local module 'main'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks, as the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions beyond importing.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to the import statement, with no data or control flow to external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import, with no data flows, external inputs, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The malware scores are appropriately zero, and the security risk scores are very low, reflecting the minimal risk of such an import. Confidence in benign assessment is high. No anomalies or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. All scores are consistent with this assessment, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
