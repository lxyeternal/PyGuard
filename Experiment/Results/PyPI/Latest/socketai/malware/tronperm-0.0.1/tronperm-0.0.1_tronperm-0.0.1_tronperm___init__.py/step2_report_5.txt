  "review": "Let's systematically analyze these reports and the underlying code snippet:\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .main import perm\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n\n- **Is the code malicious or suspicious?**  \n  No. It is a straightforward import statement importing `perm` from a local module `main`. There are no data flows, no external network calls, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Are there any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The code is syntactically correct and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Summary:** Clear, straightforward import. No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0  \n  **Verdict:** Reasonable. No change needed.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Summary:** Same as above, minimal import, no issues.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0  \n  **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Summary:** Similar import, with slightly lower confidence (0.9), minor security risk (0.1).  \n- **Analysis:** The minimal import alone cannot pose security risks. The small securityRisk score seems conservative but acceptable, given the lack of context.  \n- **Scores:** confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.1  \n  **Verdict:** Reasonable, no change needed.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Summary:** Same as above, with confidence=0.8, securityRisk=0.2.  \n- **Analysis:** Slightly lower confidence and a marginal security risk score, which seems cautious but still acceptable.  \n- **Scores:** confidence=0.8, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.2  \n  **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Summary:** Same as others, high confidence, low risk.  \n- **Scores:** confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.1  \n  **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and obfuscation scores:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code snippet. No malicious behavior is indicated.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- The code snippet is a simple, standard import statement.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The small security risk scores in some reports are conservative and acceptable, given the lack of context.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 across the board (confirmed)  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 across the board (confirmed)  \n  - **Risk:** 0 or very close to 0 (e.g., 0.1 max) — current scores are acceptable.\n\n- **Additional notes:**  \n  - No further action needed; the code is benign.\n  - If desired, the securityRisk could be uniformly set to 0, but minor scores like 0.1 or 0.2 are acceptable for cautiousness.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score |\n|---------|---------|--------------|------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0          |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0          |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.1        |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.2        |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.1        |\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No changes necessary.",
