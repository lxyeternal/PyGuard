  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from a local module named 'main' within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which reads the 'main' module from the local package.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks in this code snippet; no untrusted data or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs an import operation without data flow or execution of further code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a specific element 'perm' from a relative module 'main'. The import statement itself is straightforward and does not involve untrusted data or execution. As a single line, it shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected. Given the limited context, there is no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a standard operation within a package and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.",
