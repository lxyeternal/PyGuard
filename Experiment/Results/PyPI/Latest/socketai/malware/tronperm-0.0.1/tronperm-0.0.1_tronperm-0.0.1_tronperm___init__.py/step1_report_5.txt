{
  "purpose": "The code imports a symbol named 'perm' from a module named 'main' within the same package, likely to use the 'perm' functionality elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .main import perm",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code is a single import statement with no additional logic, which is normal and not suspicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of a symbol named 'perm'. It lacks any processing, data handling, or executable logic that could be malicious. Since it only imports a symbol, there are no apparent security risks, malware behaviors, or anomalies. There is no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent within this isolated line.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears benign. It is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
