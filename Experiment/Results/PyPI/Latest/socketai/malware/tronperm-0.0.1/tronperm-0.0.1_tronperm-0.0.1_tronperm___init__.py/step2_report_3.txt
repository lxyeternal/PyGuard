  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .main import perm\n```\n\n---\n\n### **General Observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward relative import of `perm` from a local module `main`.\n- There are no data flows, external inputs, or execution beyond import.\n- The snippet is minimal and standard, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- Based solely on this, the risk of malicious activity is extremely low.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Import statement, no anomalies, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.  \n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as Report 1, straightforward import, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.  \n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Import statement, minimal, no anomalies, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Analysis:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) despite no evident risk, perhaps due to cautious default or minor concern.\n- **Justification:** Given the minimal code, the securityRisk score could be lowered to 0, as no risk is demonstrated.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce `securityRisk` to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, benign import, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n- **Analysis:** Slightly higher securityRisk again, but still no actual risk.\n- **Recommendation:** Lower `securityRisk` to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Benign import, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous benign assessments.\n- **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports correctly assign `malware=0` and `obfuscated=0`, as there's no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n### **Overall Risk Scores:**\n- The `securityRisk` scores are slightly above zero in some reports despite the code being benign.\n- Given the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity, these should be uniformly lowered to 0 for clarity and consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0 across all reports.\n- **SecurityRisk score:** Should be 0 for all reports, as no actual risk is present.\n- **Confidence:** Already high, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are overly cautious but correctly identify the code as benign. The only improvement is to align the `securityRisk` scores to 0, reflecting the lack of any real security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis snippet is a standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious elements. No further action is necessary beyond adjusting the `securityRisk` scores for consistency.",
