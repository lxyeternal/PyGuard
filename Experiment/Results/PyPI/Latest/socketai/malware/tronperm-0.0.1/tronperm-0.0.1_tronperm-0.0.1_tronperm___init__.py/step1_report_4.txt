  "purpose": "Importing the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module file 'main' in the same package/directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network, file, or environment variable operations in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'perm' from 'main', but does not execute or process any data at this point.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets are visible. The import statement itself is standard.",
  "analysis": "This snippet simply imports 'perm' from a local module named 'main'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's simplicity limits detailed analysis, but based solely on this, it appears benign. Without further context or code, it's not possible to identify malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evident malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe based on this isolated snippet.",
