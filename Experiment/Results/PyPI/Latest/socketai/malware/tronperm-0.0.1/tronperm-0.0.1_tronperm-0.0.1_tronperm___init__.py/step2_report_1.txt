  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a single import statement: `from .main import perm`.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard in Python.\n- No evidence of data flow, untrusted inputs, or malicious behaviors is present.\n- The reports assign very low malware scores (0 or 0.1), consistent with benign code.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8–1), indicating that the analysts are confident in their benign assessment.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1–0.2), which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The import statement is present in all reports.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious constructs are evident.\n\n### Logical issues or errors:\n- No errors or flaws are apparent in the reasoning; all reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- The reasoning is consistent and aligns with the code snippet.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- Malware scores are appropriately low, given the benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are also reasonable.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, matching the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since the code is purely an import statement with no malicious activity, scores of 0 for malware and very low for security risk are justified.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty in benign nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the evidence, I agree with the overall conclusion that this snippet is benign and poses no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to the import, but no real risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious or suspicious activity. All scores should remain at their current low levels, reflecting the benign nature of this snippet.",
