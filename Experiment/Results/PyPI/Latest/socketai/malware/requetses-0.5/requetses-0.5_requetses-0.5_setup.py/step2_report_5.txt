  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, utilizing setuptools.\n- The only anomaly is the package name \"requetses,\" which resembles \"requests\" but appears to be a typo or intentional misspelling.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The code reads a local README.md file for the long description, which is typical.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or malware indicators are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Package name \"requetses\"**: This is likely a typo of \"requests\" or an intentional mimic. While it could cause dependency confusion or be used maliciously in a supply chain attack, in this code snippet alone, it's just a naming issue. No actual malicious code or behavior is present.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify the package name as suspicious but do not find any malicious activity.\n- No code errors or security flaws are detected in the setup script.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Malware score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0, correct, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk score**: Low (around 0.2), mainly due to the suspicious package name, but no actual security risk is present.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since no malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are detected, raising the malware or security risk scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The package name's similarity to \"requests\" could be exploited in supply chain attacks if maliciously distributed, but in this context, the code itself is benign.\n\n### Consistency and Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The main concern is the package name, which could be used maliciously if the package is published with malicious intent, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.2 (due to naming suspicion but no actual risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe setup script is standard, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only point of concern is the package name \"requetses,\" which could be used in a supply chain attack if maliciously distributed, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always verify the actual distribution source of the package. If \"requetses\" is published maliciously, it could pose a risk, but based solely on this code, no malicious activity is present.",
