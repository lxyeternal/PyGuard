  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The primary concern is the package name 'requetses', which could be exploited in supply chain attacks if maliciously distributed. Scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation at 0, and a slight elevation in security risk due to naming similarity. Vigilance is recommended when distributing or installing this package."
