      "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The primary concern is the package name 'requetses', which could be exploited in supply chain attacks if maliciously distributed. Scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation at 0, and a slight elevation in security risk due to naming similarity. Vigilance is recommended when distributing or installing this package."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly collecting and transmitting user images to an external server via Telegram, using hardcoded credentials and silent error handling. The behavior aligns with spyware or malware activity, justified by high malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated, but its activity is privacy-invasive and potentially harmful."
