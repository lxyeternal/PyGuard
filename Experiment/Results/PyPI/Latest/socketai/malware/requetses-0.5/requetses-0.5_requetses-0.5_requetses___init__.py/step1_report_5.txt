{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to scan specific directories for image files and send them via Telegram using a bot API.",
  "sources": "The code reads files from two specific directories: '/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Screenshots' and '/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Camera'.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent to the Telegram API endpoint 'https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/sendDocument' using untrusted file data, potentially exposing file contents.",
  "flows": "Files from the directories are opened (source), then uploaded directly via POST requests to Telegram (sink), with no validation or filtering.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded bot token and chat ID, which are sensitive credentials embedded directly in the code. No input validation or encryption is present. The code attempts to send all image files without user consent. Use of broad try-except blocks suppresses errors, masking potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The code contains hardcoded credentials ('ID1_Golden' and 'Token2_Golden') used for Telegram bot API access. It searches specific directories for image files and uploads these files directly to a Telegram chat, effectively exfiltrating potentially private images without user awareness or consent. The repeated POST requests per file could be intended for obfuscation or redundancy. No validation, encryption, or access controls are applied. The broad exception handling suppresses errors, which could hide failures or malicious activity. Overall, this pattern indicates malicious exfiltration of personal data, constituting a privacy violation and potential malware activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, as it automatically collects and exfiltrates user images to a Telegram account using hardcoded credentials, with no user interaction or permissions check. This strongly suggests malicious intent, such as privacy invasion or data theft.",
