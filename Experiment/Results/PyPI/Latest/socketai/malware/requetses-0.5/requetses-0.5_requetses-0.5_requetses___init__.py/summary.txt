  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly collecting and transmitting user images to an external server via Telegram, using hardcoded credentials and silent error handling. The behavior aligns with spyware or malware activity, justified by high malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated, but its activity is privacy-invasive and potentially harmful."
