  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided as no code is visible. It may be part of a larger project or a library intended for general use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, function arguments, and possibly external modules, but specific input sources are not clearly identifiable due to the absence of the code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, file operations, or eval/exec functions, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code snippet as no code is present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows can be identified without actual code; thus, no flow paths are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "There are no observable anomalies, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious patterns in the absence of code content. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided input contains no code to analyze. Therefore, no security risks, malicious behaviors, or anomalies can be identified. This prevents a comprehensive evaluation. If code is available, a detailed step-by-step review of source, sink, flow, and anomalies would be necessary.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for review, hence no malicious or security concerns can be confirmed. The assessment is inconclusive due to lack of content.",
