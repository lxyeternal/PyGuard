  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call: package name, version, author info, description, URL, classifiers, and Python requirements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or operations involving external input or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static configuration for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious URL (https://thugging.org), trivial author email ('hitler@gmail.com'), and the description indicating obfuscation testing but no actual obfuscation code present. No code obfuscation, malicious payloads, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no dynamic code execution, external data processing, or security-sensitive operations. The use of a questionable URL and email may raise suspicion but do not constitute malicious behavior by themselves. The description claims it's for obfuscation testing but contains no actual obfuscation or malicious code. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign setup script with some potentially suspicious metadata (URL and email) but no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. It appears to be a standard package configuration with no active malicious components.",
