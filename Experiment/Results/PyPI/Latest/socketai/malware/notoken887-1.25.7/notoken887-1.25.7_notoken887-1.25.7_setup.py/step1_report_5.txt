  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Static values within the setup() function such as package name, version, author info, description, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, user input, or untrusted data handling present; no sinks for data leakage or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious author email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org' which may indicate malicious or provocative intent; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no dynamic or obfuscated code. The only potential concern is the choice of author email and URL, which appear provocative or suspicious. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. The setup defines package metadata only.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate package configuration with no malicious behavior or malware. The main concern is the suspicious author contact details, which could be intended as an attack or trolling. Overall, the code itself is safe but the metadata raises caution.",
