  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely static, with metadata anomalies that could be exploited externally but do not constitute an active security threat. The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The security risk score can be maintained at 0.2 due to metadata concerns. Overall, the package is safe from a supply chain security perspective."
