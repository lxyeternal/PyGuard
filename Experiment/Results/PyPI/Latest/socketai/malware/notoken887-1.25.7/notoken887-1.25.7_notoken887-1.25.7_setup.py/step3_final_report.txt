  "purpose": "Static package setup configuration using setuptools with metadata.",
  "sources": "Static data fields in setup() call: name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no dynamic data or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author_email ('hitler@gmail.com'), URL ('https://thugging.org'), description mentioning obfuscation test but no actual obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup script with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The only anomalies are metadata fields that are suspicious but do not impact code security. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior and assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0. The security risk score is marginally elevated (~0.2) due to metadata concerns, which are external to code execution. No evidence suggests active malicious intent or obfuscation within the code. The scores are consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely static, with metadata anomalies that could be exploited externally but do not constitute an active security threat. The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The security risk score can be maintained at 0.2 due to metadata concerns. Overall, the package is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
