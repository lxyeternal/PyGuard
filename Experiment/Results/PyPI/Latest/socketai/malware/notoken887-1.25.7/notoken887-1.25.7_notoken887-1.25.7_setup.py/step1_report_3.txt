  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'notoken887' with metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static source code, package metadata, and input parameters in the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to critical functions; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The author email is suspicious ('hitler@gmail.com'), and the URL points to a potentially malicious or inappropriate site ('https://thugging.org'). No obfuscation or malicious code constructs are present. The description claims to be for an obfuscation test library but provides no actual code or functionality. No hidden backdoors or code injection detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It only specifies package metadata and configuration parameters. No code execution, user input handling, or dynamic behaviors are included. The author email and URL are potentially malicious or untrustworthy, but these are metadata fields and do not indicate malicious behavior in the code itself. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are detected. The package appears to be a simple metadata configuration for a test library, with some suspicious contact info and URL that could be used for malicious purposes outside the code context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup configuration with no embedded malicious behavior. The only concern is the suspicious contact details and URL, which could be used for malicious purposes if leveraged in an attack or scam, but the code itself does not contain malicious logic.",
