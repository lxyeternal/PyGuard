      "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely static, with metadata anomalies that could be exploited externally but do not constitute an active security threat. The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The security risk score can be maintained at 0.2 due to metadata concerns. Overall, the package is safe from a supply chain security perspective."

No significant adjustments are necessary; the overall assessment indicates minimal malicious activity with some signs of obfuscation and potential dynamic features that warrant cautious monitoring. The analysis supports a low malware risk (around 0.1), moderate obfuscation concern (around 0.2), and low to moderate security risk (0.2–0.3)."

      "conclusion": "The code contains a severe security vulnerability due to the `exec()` call that executes external code, which could be malicious. The substitution cipher is benign, but the embedded code execution makes this code highly dangerous and potentially malicious. The high malware and security risk scores are justified, and the overall assessment should classify this as unsafe for supply chain use."
