{
  "purpose": "This code is a Pyarmor runtime loader, importing an obfuscated/encrypted payload used for license enforcement or code protection.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the embedded binary blob passed to __pyarmor__ function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no external data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code imports a runtime module and invokes __pyarmor__ with embedded encrypted data, which is used internally for licensing or obfuscation purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the large binary blob is consistent with encrypted license or obfuscation data, typical for Pyarmor protection.",
  "analysis": "Static analysis shows a standard Pyarmor runtime invocation with encrypted payload. No network activity, file I/O, or malicious behavior detected. The binary data is likely encrypted license or obfuscation info. The high obfuscation score is justified, and malware or risk scores should be low. The suspicion in some reports stems from obfuscation alone, which is common in license enforcement, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Pyarmor protection mechanism, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The high obfuscation and encrypted payload are typical for licensing or DRM, not malware. Static analysis alone cannot confirm malicious payloads, but based on the code structure, it appears benign.",
