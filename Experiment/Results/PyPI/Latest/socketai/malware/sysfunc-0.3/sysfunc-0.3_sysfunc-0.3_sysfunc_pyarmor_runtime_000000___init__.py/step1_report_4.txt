  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module for code obfuscation or protection purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks or external effects detected",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code simply imports a module",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating a trial version of Pyarmor with an expiration date; no unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports a runtime component of Pyarmor, a legitimate obfuscation tool. The comment suggests usage of a trial version, which is common for licensed software. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal, straightforward, and serves a protective or obfuscation purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign import statement for Pyarmor runtime with a comment indicating trial usage. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
