  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ attribute from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for runtime protection or obfuscation management.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data processing or external communication",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating trial version and date, but no suspicious or malicious code features observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a comment line indicating the version and trial status of Pyarmor, followed by an import statement that imports __pyarmor__ from a local module. No code execution, data input, or external communication occurs. The import is typical for code protected or obfuscated with Pyarmor. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to be a standard part of code protected or obfuscated using Pyarmor, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
