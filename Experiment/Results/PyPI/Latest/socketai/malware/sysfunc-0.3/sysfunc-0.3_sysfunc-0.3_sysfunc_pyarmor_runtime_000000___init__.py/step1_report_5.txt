{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or licensing purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output or external communication observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only a single import statement without further logic",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating Pyarmor version and trial status; no suspicious or malicious code activities",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific module '__pyarmor__' from a relative package 'pyarmor_runtime', which is typical for obfuscated or protected Python code using Pyarmor. The comment suggests this is a trial version, possibly indicating code protection rather than malicious intent. There are no indications of data leaks, network activity, or malicious behaviors. The code is minimal, serving as a runtime loader for obfuscation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement associated with Pyarmor, a legitimate code obfuscation tool. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
