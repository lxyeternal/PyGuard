{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import a runtime module related to Pyarmor, a tool used for code obfuscation and licensing protection.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only performs an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a comment indicating it is part of a Pyarmor trial, with version and expiration date, which may suggest licensing enforcement or obfuscation. No suspicious or malicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module associated with Pyarmor, a known obfuscation tool. The comment indicates a trial version with an expiration date, likely used for licensing purposes. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious control flow, is present. The code is minimal and appears legitimate for its purpose of protecting or running obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement related to Pyarmor's runtime, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a protected or obfuscated Python package that uses Pyarmor for licensing or code protection.",
