{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ object from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for runtime protection or obfuscation features.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external effects",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only imports a module",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating trial version, but no suspicious code or behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a specific object from a local module named pyarmor_runtime. The comment indicates a Pyarmor trial version, which is common for code obfuscation tools. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, external data handling, or suspicious logic. The code's purpose appears to be related to obfuscation or licensing enforcement, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement associated with Pyarmor, a legitimate obfuscation tool. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
