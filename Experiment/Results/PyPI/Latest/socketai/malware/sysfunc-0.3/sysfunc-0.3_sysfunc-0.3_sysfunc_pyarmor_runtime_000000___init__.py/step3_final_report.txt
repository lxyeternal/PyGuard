{
  "purpose": "Import __pyarmor__ from the local module __pyarmor_runtime__, likely for runtime protection or licensing enforcement in obfuscated code.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which reads from a local module __pyarmor_runtime__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code simply imports a symbol without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of comments indicating a trial version and expiration date, but these are benign and typical for obfuscation tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement associated with Pyarmor, a tool for code obfuscation and licensing. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity is evident. The comments about trial status are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The scores across reports reflect minimal obfuscation and zero malware risk, which are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as part of a protected or obfuscated package using Pyarmor. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
