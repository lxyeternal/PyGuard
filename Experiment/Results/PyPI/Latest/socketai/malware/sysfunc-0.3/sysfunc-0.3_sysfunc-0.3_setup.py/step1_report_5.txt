  "purpose": "The setup.py script is intended to configure and install a Python package named 'sysfunc' for interacting with system functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and configuration data such as package name, version, packages to include, author, Python version requirement, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "The script does not contain code that processes untrusted input or writes data to external systems; it only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the setup process uses static metadata for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code adheres to standard setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to configure a package named 'sysfunc'. It specifies package metadata and configuration options without executing any dynamic code or processing external input. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The script is straightforward and typical for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on this script alone.",
