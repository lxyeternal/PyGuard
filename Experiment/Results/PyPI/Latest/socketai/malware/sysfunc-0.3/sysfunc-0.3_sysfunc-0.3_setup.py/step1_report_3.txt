{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script is used to package and distribute a Python library named 'sysfunc' that interacts with system functions.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from the setup() function parameters such as package name, version, description, author, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data; the script only defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "The flow is primarily static configuration data supplied to setup(), with no runtime data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. The code is straightforward and follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then defines a package configuration with fixed metadata. It specifies the package name, version, packages to include, and some metadata attributes. There are no code execution, data collection, or malicious behavior indicators. The code is simple, static, and standard for Python package setup files. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines package metadata for distribution.",
