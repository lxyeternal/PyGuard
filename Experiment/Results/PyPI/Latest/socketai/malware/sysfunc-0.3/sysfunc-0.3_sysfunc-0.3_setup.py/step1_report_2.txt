  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the 'sysfunc' Python library.",
  "sources": "N/A (setup.py is a configuration script; no external input reading is explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no code execution, data output, or external communications present).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from sources to sinks, as this is a setup configuration).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package configuration, defines package metadata such as name, version, author, and requirements, and specifies package data inclusion and classifiers. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. The author is a single user 'Hosne432', and the script conforms to standard Python packaging practices. No suspicious or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a typical package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate, benign package setup script.",
