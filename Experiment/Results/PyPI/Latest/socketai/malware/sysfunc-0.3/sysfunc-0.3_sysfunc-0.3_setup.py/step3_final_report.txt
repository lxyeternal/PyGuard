  "purpose": "Standard package configuration for Python distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata such as name, version, author, classifiers, and package data via static code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Static source definitions without data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual author name 'Hosne432' but no malicious or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script importing setuptools, defining package metadata, and calling setup(). No dynamic code, external data, or obfuscation is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The author name is unconventional but not malicious. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration script with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
