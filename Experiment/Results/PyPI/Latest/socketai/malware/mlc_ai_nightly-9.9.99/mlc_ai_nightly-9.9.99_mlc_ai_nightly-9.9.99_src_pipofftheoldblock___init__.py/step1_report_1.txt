{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to a Python package intended for general functionality, possibly including data processing or utility functions. No explicit malicious intent is evident from the code provided.",
  "sources": "Input is read from function parameters, environment variables, or external modules, but no clear untrusted sources are identified within the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file system writes, or subprocess executions if present, but none are explicitly shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters, env vars) through internal processing to output or external calls, but specific flows are not detailed without the actual code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident. The code does not exhibit obfuscated features, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code is not provided in detail; thus, the review is limited to structural considerations. No signs of malicious behavior such as system data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are apparent. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious by itself. The absence of obvious insecure practices or embedded malicious code indicates low risk. Without concrete code, confidence remains moderate.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code appears benign with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The lack of detailed code prevents a thorough analysis, but nothing suspicious is detected in the structural overview.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
