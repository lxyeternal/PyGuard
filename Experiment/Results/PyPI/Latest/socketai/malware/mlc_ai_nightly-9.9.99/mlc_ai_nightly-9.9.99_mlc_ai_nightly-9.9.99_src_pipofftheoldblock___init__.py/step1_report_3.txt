{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module intended for data processing or utility functions, but no explicit purpose is clearly defined within the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include reading input from environment variables, function arguments, or external files (though none are explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks are data outputs such as printing to console, writing to files, or network requests (none are explicitly present).",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow is observable without further context; the code mainly consists of function definitions and variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code structure is straightforward; no obfuscated or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard Python functions and imports without any signs of malicious activity. No external network calls, eval/exec usage, or data exfiltration mechanisms are visible. The absence of suspicious code constructs suggests no malicious intent. Lack of input handling or data flow limits deeper analysis, but nothing suspicious is evident within this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and standard in nature.",
