  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a general utility script or package component, possibly for data processing or network operations. Exact intent is unclear without more context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, or possibly external data sources such as files or network responses (if present).",
  "sinks": "The code writes to the console, logs, or potentially makes network requests, executes commands, or interacts with system files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, function parameters, external inputs) through processing functions to sinks such as logs, network calls, or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. No backdoors or hidden behaviors evident. Code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, including the initial, middle, and final sections. No malicious code, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network communication with suspicious domains, was identified. Usage of third-party libraries seems legitimate, and no insecure practices like unsanitized SQL or insecure random generation are evident. There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The overall security risk score is low.",
