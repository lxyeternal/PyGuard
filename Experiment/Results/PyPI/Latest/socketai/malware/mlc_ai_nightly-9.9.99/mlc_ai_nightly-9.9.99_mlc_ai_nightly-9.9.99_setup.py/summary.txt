  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behavior characteristic of malicious activity—executing external code during setup without validation. The scores in the reports are appropriate, but I would assign a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk of 0.9, reflecting the high potential for malicious payloads and system compromise."
