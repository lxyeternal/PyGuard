  "purpose": "A single static print statement outputting a benign message with no inputs, external calls, or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only outputs a static message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code features present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a print statement with a static message. It does not process inputs, perform external calls, or contain obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected, and the code's purpose appears to be purely informational or humorous. The absence of any data flows, external dependencies, or malicious code confirms its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
