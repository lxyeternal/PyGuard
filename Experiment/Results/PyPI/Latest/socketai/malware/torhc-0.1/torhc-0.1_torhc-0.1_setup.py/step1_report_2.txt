  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to execute specific shell commands during package installation.",
  "sources": "The lambda functions that construct URLs and command strings; subprocess.run calls executing shell commands.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run calls executing shell commands with constructed strings that include a URL and potentially malicious commands.",
  "flows": "The constructed URL and command strings are executed via subprocess.run, potentially leading to command execution with untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda functions to build strings character-by-character; execution of shell commands with dynamic content; suppression of errors; no explicit validation of inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon running, constructs a URL and command strings via lambda functions. It then executes a shell command that fetches data from the URL and pipes it into another command. The use of shell=True, combined with dynamic string construction, raises concern for code injection or execution of malicious code. The URL and commands are obfuscated, possibly to evade detection. The subprocess calls are silent on errors, which could hide malicious activity. The overall structure suggests the code could download and execute malicious payloads during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated string constructions and executes shell commands that fetch and run data from an external URL, which poses a high security risk. The use of dynamic command execution, obfuscation, and silent failure handling indicate potentially malicious behavior aimed at executing remote code during installation.",
