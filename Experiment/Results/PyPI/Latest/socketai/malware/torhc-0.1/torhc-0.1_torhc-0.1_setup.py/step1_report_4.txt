  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to execute remote commands during package installation",
  "sources": "The lambda function get_url constructs a URL; subprocess.run executes commands using this URL and hardcoded commands",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run executes system commands that can download and run remote code",
  "flows": "The get_url lambda constructs a remote URL; subprocess.run fetches and executes content from this URL; the second subprocess run pipes commands from the URL to another process",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda functions to construct strings from ASCII codes; dynamic execution of system commands with remote URL; suppression of errors with try-except blocks; no validation or restriction of external input",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during run(), constructs a URL and two strings via lambda functions. It then attempts to execute a subprocess that runs commands: first, a command to download or interact with the remote URL, then pipes the output into another command. The URL is hardcoded but obfuscated via ASCII codes, indicating an attempt to conceal intent. The subprocess commands are executed with shell=True, which is risky. The code suppresses exceptions broadly, which could hide failures. The overall behavior indicates potential malicious activity, such as downloading and executing remote scripts during package installation, which is a supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes obfuscated remote URL construction and executes system commands during installation that could fetch and run malicious code, representing high risk. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious or at least extremely dangerous.",
