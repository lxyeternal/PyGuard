{
  "purpose": "The code obfuscates URLs and commands via ASCII arrays and executes remote commands during package installation, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "ASCII-encoded strings for URLs and commands, subprocess.run calls with shell=True, external URL fetching.",
  "sinks": "Execution of shell commands that fetch and run remote content, potentially leading to code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "ASCII string construction -> subprocess.run with shell=True -> remote URL fetch and execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ASCII arrays and lambda functions to obfuscate strings, silent broad exception handling, remote URL fetch during install, execution with shell=True.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs obfuscated URLs and commands from ASCII arrays, then executes them via subprocess with shell=True, which is risky. The URL points to external resources, possibly malicious. Silent error handling can hide failures. These behaviors are indicative of malicious intent, typical of supply chain attacks or backdoors. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.8-0.9, security risk 0.9-0.95) are justified. The obfuscation and remote execution patterns strongly suggest malicious activity, warranting high malware and risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, involving obfuscated remote command execution during installation. The behavior aligns with supply chain compromise tactics. Scores of approximately 0.9 for malware and risk are appropriate, reflecting a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
