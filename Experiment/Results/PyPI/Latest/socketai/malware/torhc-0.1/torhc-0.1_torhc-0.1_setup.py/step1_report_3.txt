{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to run additional commands during package installation, potentially to download or execute external code.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded byte lists that are converted into strings representing URLs and commands.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.run with shell=True to execute dynamically constructed shell commands that include external URL downloads and execution, which could lead to code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded URL and command strings are constructed, then passed to subprocess.run, executing potentially malicious commands or downloading malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda functions to construct command strings from ASCII codes, dynamic execution with subprocess.run and shell=True, and the attempt to run external commands that appear obfuscated. The URL points to a GitHub repository, which could be malicious if used to fetch code or payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon execution, constructs a URL and command strings from ASCII character codes. It then attempts to run a subprocess that fetches code from an external URL using curl, piping it through a shell command. The URL points to a GitHub repository, suggesting a potential for remote code fetch or execution. The use of shell=True with dynamically constructed strings increases risk. The try-except blocks suppress errors silently, making detection harder. Overall, this pattern is consistent with malicious behavior aiming to download and execute external code during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by executing external commands constructed from obfuscated strings, including fetching remote content and executing it, which poses a high security risk. The use of obfuscation and dynamic execution suggests malicious intent, likely designed to compromise systems during package installation.",
