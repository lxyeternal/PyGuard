  "purpose": "A simple function that prints a static message 'YOU SHALL NOT PASS!'",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or external data flows.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'cli' that outputs a fixed string. It does not process external input, perform data manipulation, or invoke system/network operations. The code is simple, static, and lacks any signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. There are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, static, and poses no security threat. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
