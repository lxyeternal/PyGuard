      "conclusion": "The code performs covert system info exfiltration during installation, representing malicious and privacy-invasive behavior. The high malware and security risk scores are justified; the behavior warrants high alert and should be flagged as malicious. The current scoring is appropriate, with a slight recommendation to raise the malware score in report 4 to 0.8 for accuracy."
