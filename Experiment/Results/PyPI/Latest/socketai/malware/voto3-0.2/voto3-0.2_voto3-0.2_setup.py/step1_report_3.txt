{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes a post-installation action.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information via platform.node() and platform.system(), and makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs (webhook URL and ipify API).",
  "sinks": "The URL constructed using platform data and IP address is used in a GET request, potentially transmitting system information to an external server.",
  "flows": "On installation, the run method triggers the send() function, which collects system info, constructs a URL, and sends a GET request to a remote webhook endpoint, potentially leaking system information.",
  "anomalies": "The send() function automatically sends system hostname, OS type, and external IP to an external URL during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The use of requests.get() to transmit data without user consent is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a send() function that prints a message, then constructs a URL embedding system hostname, OS info, and external IP address obtained via requests. It then performs a GET request to this URL. The custom install class overrides the run() method to execute this send() function after installation. This behavior is hidden within the package installation process and transmits system information to an external webhook URL. No user consent or notification is provided, and the external URL may be used for tracking or malicious data collection. The overall structure and logic are straightforward, but the automatic data exfiltration during install is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external server during installation without user consent. This constitutes a privacy violation and potential security risk. The code is not obfuscated but performs a covert data transmission, indicating malicious intent.",
