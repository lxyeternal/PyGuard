{
  "purpose": "The code executes a covert data exfiltration during package installation by sending system hostname, OS, and public IP to an external webhook URL without user consent.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), platform.system(), requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')",
  "sinks": "requests.get(url) where url includes system info, transmitting data to external server",
  "flows": "source: system info variables -> sink: requests.get() with constructed URL",
  "anomalies": "Network request during installation without user notification, data sent to external URL, no user consent, straightforward code with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, upon execution, runs a send() function. This function gathers system hostname, OS, and public IP address, then constructs a URL embedding this data and performs a GET request to send it to an external webhook. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation, without user notification or consent, indicating covert data collection. The code is simple, with no obfuscation or malicious backdoors, but the exfiltration behavior is privacy-intrusive and potentially malicious. The high scores assigned in most reports (0.75 to 0.9 for malware, 0.75 to 0.9 for security risk) are justified, reflecting the severity of covert data transmission. The only adjustment recommended is increasing the malware score in report 4 from 0.5 to 0.8 to better represent the malicious nature of the exfiltration. Overall, the behavior constitutes malicious activity, and the scores are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert system info exfiltration during installation, representing malicious and privacy-invasive behavior. The high malware and security risk scores are justified; the behavior warrants high alert and should be flagged as malicious. The current scoring is appropriate, with a slight recommendation to raise the malware score in report 4 to 0.8 for accuracy.",
