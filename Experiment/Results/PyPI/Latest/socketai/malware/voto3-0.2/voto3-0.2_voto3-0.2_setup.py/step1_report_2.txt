{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that performs a post-installation action to send system information to an external webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' to obtain the public IP address; the URL constructed with system hostname and OS info; the webhook URL with embedded data.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to the constructed webhook URL with embedded system data; potentially leaks system info upon installation.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves system data, constructs a URL with that data, then performs a GET request to the URL, sending system information to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Post-install script that automatically sends system hostname, OS, and IP address to an external webhook without user consent; no user prompt or configuration; use of requests in setup script for this purpose is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a 'send' function that collects system hostname ('platform.node()'), system type ('platform.system()'), and public IP address ('requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')'). It constructs a URL embedding this data and sends a GET request to a webhook URL, likely for exfiltration. The custom 'PostInstallCommand' class overrides the 'run' method to execute 'send' after installation. The setup configuration assigns this command to run after install. This behavior indicates that the package secretly transmits system info to an external server during installation, which can be used for malicious purposes such as tracking or reconnaissance. No other malicious code or backdoors are present, but this exfiltration behavior is malicious in context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an unauthorized data exfiltration during package installation by sending system hostname, OS info, and public IP to an external webhook. This indicates malicious intent with privacy violations, qualifying as malware. The risk score is high, and the malware score is also high due to the covert data transmission.",
