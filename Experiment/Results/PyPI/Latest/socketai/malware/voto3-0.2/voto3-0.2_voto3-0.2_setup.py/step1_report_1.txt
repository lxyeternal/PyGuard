  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'voto3' package with a custom post-install step.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs ('https://api.ipify.org' and the webhook URL).",
  "sinks": "Requests made to external URLs which can leak data or perform unwanted network actions.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'send' function executes, retrieving the system's hostname, public IP, and sending this data to a webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends system information to an external URL without user consent, which is unusual and potentially malicious. No input validation or user notification occurs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup and install modules. It defines a 'send' function that prints a message and then constructs a URL incorporating the system hostname, OS name, and current public IP address fetched from 'https://api.ipify.org'. It then performs a GET request to this URL. The custom install class runs the 'send' function after installation completes. This behavior could be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscation detected. The external network request during installation is suspicious as it leaks system info.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes a malicious or privacy-intrusive behavior by sending system info to an external webhook during installation. This action could be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or malicious data collection. The rest of the code is standard package setup code.",
