  "anomalies": "Unusual post-install behavior: sending system info to an external webhook during installation, use of requests to send potentially sensitive data",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'voto3'. It defines a custom install command that, after installation, runs a function 'send' which retrieves the machine's hostname, OS name, and external IP address. It then constructs a URL with this information and makes a GET request to a webhook URL. This behavior is suspicious because it sends system information to an external server without user consent, which could be used for tracking or malicious data collection. No malicious code such as backdoors or destructive commands is present, but the data exfiltration during install is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a potentially malicious action by sending system information to an external webhook during package installation, indicating a privacy violation or malicious tracking behavior. The overall code structure is otherwise typical for a setup script, but the post-install network activity is suspicious.",
