  "purpose": "Define and run a setup process that installs the package and performs a post-install action.",
  "sources": "Reading system info (platform.node(), platform.system()), fetching public IP address via requests.get('https://api.ipify.org'), and the URL constructed with these data.",
  "sinks": "Sending a GET request to an external URL (webhook) with system data as query parameters.",
  "flows": "System info and public IP collected during send() function execution, then sent via a GET request to a remote webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Post-install hook sends system and IP address data to an external URL without user consent. Uses platform and requests modules, which are standard but combined here for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a package with setuptools, defining a custom install command that, after installation, calls send(). The send() function prints a message and constructs a URL embedding the system's hostname, OS type, and public IP address, fetched from an external API. It then sends a GET request to this URL, potentially exfiltrating sensitive system information. This behavior occurs automatically post-install, without user awareness or consent. The purpose appears to be data collection or exfiltration rather than legitimate setup activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data exfiltration during package installation by sending system details and public IP to a remote webhook. This constitutes malicious behavior, as it compromises user privacy and system security without notification or consent. The overall security risk is high.",
