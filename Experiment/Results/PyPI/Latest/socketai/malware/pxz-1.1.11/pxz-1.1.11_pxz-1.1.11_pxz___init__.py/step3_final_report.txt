  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and malicious potential of the open source Python dependency based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Input data sources, environment variables, user inputs, external modules, and potential code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Data transmission, system commands, environment variable access, network connections, or file modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via function calls, dynamic execution, or data handling points, possibly involving obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious use of eval/exec, obfuscation, incomplete code, or unusual import patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either absence of code or lack of concrete malicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the descriptions. Security risk scores are low (around 0.2-0.3), justified by potential unvalidated inputs or structural hints but no confirmed malicious activity. Confidence levels vary based on the completeness of information, with cautious assessments where code is missing or incomplete. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation, and the reasoning aligns with the observed data.",
  "conclusion": "The overall evaluation confirms that the dependency does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation based on the provided reports. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary; the dependency can be considered safe under current information.",
