{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to gather system information and send it to a specified remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, and current time. It also reads the URL for data transmission.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data via an HTTP GET request to an external IP address, potentially exposing system information to an untrusted entity.",
  "flows": "System info is collected and then encoded into URL parameters, which are sent over the network via an HTTP GET request to the specified server.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects sensitive system information and transmits it to an external server during the package installation process, which is unusual behavior for a typical Python package. The server URL appears hardcoded and points to a specific IP, which can be suspicious. The function is invoked automatically during installation, without user consent or obvious purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for network requests, environment info, and datetime. It defines a function to collect system info and send it via an HTTP request to a fixed external IP address. The function gathers public IP via an external API, retrieves hostname, home directory, current directory, and timestamp. It encodes these details into URL parameters and makes a GET request to the specified server. This operation is triggered automatically during package installation via a custom install command class. The purpose appears to be exfiltration of system data without explicit user awareness. While technically not malicious in the sense of damaging code, this behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of potential privacy violations or backdoor activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized collection and exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is suspicious. It is likely malicious or at least privacy-invasive, especially given the hidden nature of data transmission during installation without user consent.",
