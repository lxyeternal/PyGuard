{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information (public IP, hostname, directories, current time) and send it to a specified remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system info via os and datetime modules; makes network requests with urlopen to retrieve public IP and send data to server.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external IP address (http://35.170.187.220:8080/), sending potentially sensitive system data without user consent.",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() gathers data from system and network, then constructs a URL with parameters that is sent via urlopen to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "The function runs during package installation, sending system info automatically without user interaction, which is unusual behavior for a typical package. No user consent prompts are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to collect system info, including public IP, hostname, user directory, current directory, and timestamp. It then constructs a URL with these details and makes an HTTP GET request to a remote server, potentially transmitting sensitive data. This behavior is embedded in a custom installation command, meaning it executes every time the package is installed. The code does not contain obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or encryption, but it performs automatic data exfiltration. The remote server URL indicates a possible malicious intent to harvest system info without user knowledge or approval.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains code that automatically collects and exfiltrates system information during installation, without explicit user consent, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It could be used for tracking or data theft, representing a security risk.",
