{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information (public IP, hostname, directories, current time) and send it to a specified external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Data sources include the URL 'https://api.ipify.org' for public IP, 'os.uname()' for hostname, and environment variables for directories; the data is gathered in the collect_system_info() function.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via an HTTP GET request to 'http://35.170.187.220:8080/' which could be a malicious external server receiving system info.",
  "flows": "The flow involves collecting system info from trusted sources, encoding as URL parameters, and sending via an HTTP request to an external server during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends system information to an external server without user consent, during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious. There are no apparent safeguards or user notifications.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules for system and network information. The collect_system_info() function retrieves the public IP, hostname, user home directory, current working directory, and timestamp. It then constructs a URL with these parameters and makes a network request to a hardcoded external server. This network activity occurs automatically during package installation via a custom install command. The code lacks user warnings, opt-in prompts, or configuration options, indicating potential privacy invasion or malicious data collection. The use of direct URL connection and automated data transmission without explicit user consent is suspicious and typical of malicious or invasive behavior. The server URL is hardcoded and external, with no validation or encryption, raising further security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly collects and transmits system information to an external server during package installation, without user awareness or consent. This behavior is suspicious and could be malicious, aiming to spy on users' systems or exfiltrate data.",
