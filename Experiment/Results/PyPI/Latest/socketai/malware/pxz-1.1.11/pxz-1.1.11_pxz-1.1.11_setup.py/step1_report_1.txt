{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information (public IP, hostname, directories, current time) and send it to a specified server during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the network (https://api.ipify.org, http://35.170.187.220:8080/), and filesystem (os.uname(), os.path.expanduser, os.getcwd()), as well as current system time.",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL with system info is used in a network request to the specified server URL, which can potentially leak system data to an external server.",
  "flows": "Source: urlopen('https://api.ipify.org') -> collect system info; then URL construction using system info -> urlopen(request) to external server (http://35.170.187.220:8080/).",
  "anomalies": "The code gathers detailed system info and sends it to an external server during package installation without user consent, which is unusual. The server address is hardcoded. The code runs during the install process, which can be hidden or malicious if used maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The script collects public IP, hostname, user home directory, current directory, and timestamp. It then constructs a GET request URL embedding these data points and sends it to an external IP address, possibly for tracking or reconnaissance. The data collection occurs during package installation, which is not transparent to the user. There are no obfuscated elements or suspicious library use. The code does not perform malicious actions beyond data exfiltration, assuming the server endpoint is controlled by an attacker.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary purpose appears to be data collection and exfiltration of system information during package installation, without explicit user consent. While it does not contain malicious payloads like malware or destructive actions, it poses a privacy concern and potential security risk by transmitting system details to an external server during install.",
