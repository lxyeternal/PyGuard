{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, timestamp) and sends it to an external server during package installation, likely for covert data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the network (https://api.ipify.org), system calls (os.uname(), os.path.expanduser(), os.getcwd()), and the current timestamp.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.170.187.220:8080/).",
  "flows": "Data is collected from network and system sources, assembled into URL parameters, and transmitted via an HTTP request during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "The data collection and transmission occur automatically during package installation without user notification or consent; the server URL is hardcoded; no obfuscation or encryption is used.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward system info collection and exfiltration during installation, which is unusual for typical packages. It does not contain malicious payloads or destructive actions but exhibits covert data transmission. The server URL is hardcoded, and the operation occurs silently, indicating privacy invasion. The code is clear and not obfuscated. The network request is simple and direct. The behavior aligns with privacy-invasive or potentially malicious activity, warranting high suspicion. The malware score of 0.75 and security risk of 0.8 are justified given the covert exfiltration and privacy concerns. The behavior is serious but does not involve destructive payloads, so the scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits covert data exfiltration during installation, raising significant privacy and security concerns. While not containing malicious payloads, its behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, justifying high malware and risk scores. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. Overall, it poses a high security risk due to privacy invasion and should be treated with caution.",
