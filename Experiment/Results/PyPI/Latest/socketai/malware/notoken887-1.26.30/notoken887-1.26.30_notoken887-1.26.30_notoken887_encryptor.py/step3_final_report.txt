{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable from 'https://thugging.org/files/sm.exe' and executes it via 'os.startfile'. The 'decrypt' method calls 'pt()', causing side effects during decryption, indicating malicious intent. The character substitution cipher is used for obfuscation but is not inherently malicious.",
  "sources": "The 'requests.get' call fetching 'sm.exe', the 'os.startfile' execution, and the 'decrypt' method invoking 'pt()'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via 'os.startfile', potential system compromise from remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Input from network ('requests.get') flows into writing 'sm.exe' in the Documents folder, then is executed via 'os.startfile'. The 'decrypt()' method triggers 'pt()', causing side effects during decryption.",
  "anomalies": "The 'pt()' function is invoked within 'decrypt()', causing remote code download and execution during decryption, which is suspicious and malicious. The character substitution cipher is used for obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary malicious behavior is the 'pt()' function downloading and executing external code from a suspicious URL. Its invocation within 'decrypt()' indicates malicious side effects during decryption. The cipher is a layer of obfuscation. The URL and behavior are high risk. Scores across reports are consistent, with malware and risk scores at or near 1. The obfuscation score reflects the cipher's presence. Overall, the code is highly malicious, with remote code execution and obfuscation designed to hide malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high malicious intent through remote download and execution of external payloads, invoked during decryption, with obfuscation to conceal intent. Scores are justified; the package should be considered highly malicious and dangerous.",
