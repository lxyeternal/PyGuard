  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887', including package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, imports from setuptools, reads package information, and defines entry points.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or external outputs detected.",
  "flows": "N/A – no untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a suspicious email 'hitler@gmail.com' and a URL 'https://thugging.org' which are unprofessional and potentially malicious or malicious-looking, but these are metadata rather than code execution points. No obfuscated or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package name, version, author info, description, URL, classifiers, Python version requirements, and entry points. The author email and URL are unconventional and suspicious but do not indicate malicious code execution. The rest of the setup script appears normal, with no dynamic code, obfuscated sections, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with unprofessional or suspicious metadata, but no malicious code or security risks are detected. The email and URL are potentially untrustworthy, but they are metadata only and do not pose security threats.",
