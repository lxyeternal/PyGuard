  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with unprofessional but non-malicious metadata. No active malicious or obfuscated code is present. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the slight elevation in risk score is justified by metadata concerns. Overall, the package is safe to use from a security perspective, with the caveat of unprofessional contact information."
