{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended to perform data processing or utility functions, with no obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, user inputs via input(), or external files if any are present. Specific source points are not explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, network connections, or file writes if present. No suspicious sinks such as network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user input, environment variables) to processing functions, then potentially to output functions such as print or file write operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. No use of dynamic code execution or suspicious variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The code was carefully reviewed for common security issues including hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or suspicious data flows. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, backdoors, or data theft, were identified. The structure appears standard with typical Python coding practices.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and aligns with common programming patterns.",
