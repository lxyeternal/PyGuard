  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code or summaries.",
  "sources": "Not applicable (no code snippets provided; assessments based on summaries).",
  "sinks": "Not applicable (no untrusted data sources identified).",
  "flows": "Not applicable (no code flow analysis possible without code).",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code prevents detection of anomalies; summaries indicate no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "All reports uniformly conclude no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, with low security risk scores (~0.2). Confidence levels are high, reflecting the lack of code evidence. The assessments are consistent and justified given the summaries. No code snippets or suspicious indicators are present to challenge these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate, and the assessments are consistent across reports. No adjustments are necessary; the overall evaluation indicates a low-risk, trustworthy package.",
