{
  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from a local module 'main', likely to execute or utilize it elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; potential data sources include the 'main.py' module, but not directly in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'run' if invoked elsewhere; no direct sink in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Importing 'run' from 'main' could lead to execution if 'run' is called later, but not in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement: 'from .main import run'. It is syntactically correct and typical in Python projects. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies are present. The security implications depend on the content of 'main.py', which is not provided; however, the import statement itself is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), acknowledging that if 'main.py' executes code at import, it could pose a risk, but this cannot be determined from the snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate given the minimal and straightforward nature of the code.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
