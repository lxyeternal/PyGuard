{
  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from the local 'main' module, likely for execution or further use within the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local 'main' module via the import statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow occurs; the code only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement with relative module syntax. No suspicious or unusual activity detected.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a standard import of a function from a local module. It does not contain any input handling, data processing, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. Given the simplicity, the risk is minimal, but the overall security depends on the content of 'main.py'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger codebase, and on its own, it poses no security threat.",
