{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'run' from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which reads a local module 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is visible within this code fragment, as it only contains an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a function from a relative module 'main'. It does not perform any operations, network communication, or data handling on its own. The presence of an import statement is standard and does not imply malicious intent. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this isolated snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns. The code appears to be part of a larger program, and on its own, it does not pose any threat.",
