{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'run' from a local module named 'main', likely to execute some core functionality of a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module, which could potentially execute code if 'main' contains executable statements at import time.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "None observable in this minimal snippet, as no functions or data processing are shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, containing only an import statement. No suspicious or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'run' from a relative module 'main', which is a standard practice. Without further context, it's impossible to determine if 'main' executes malicious code upon import, but the statement itself is common. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or obfuscated code are evident. The minimal nature of this code prevents any detailed source-to-sink analysis beyond the import itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger project where 'run' would be called elsewhere. No suspicious activity is indicated.",
