  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'pnuske' Python package, defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools, the setup() function, find_packages(), and the entry_points dictionary specifying the console script.",
  "sinks": "The 'pnuske:run' entry point could invoke code within the 'pnuske' module, potentially executing malicious code if 'pnuske' contains harmful code.",
  "flows": "The setup script itself does not execute any code beyond package configuration; however, installation and execution of the 'pnuske' command may run code within the 'pnuske' module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in the static setup code; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated content present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary functions for packaging, defines the package metadata, and specifies an entry point for a command-line script. The use of find_packages() suggests dynamic package discovery. The entry point 'pnuske=pnuske:run' indicates that executing 'pnuske' will invoke the 'run' function within the 'pnuske' module, which could be malicious if 'pnuske' contains harmful code. However, the setup script itself is standard and does not contain malicious code. The actual behavior depends on the implementation of the 'pnuske' module's 'run' function, which is outside the scope of this script.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script appears standard and does not contain malicious code by itself. However, the 'pnuske' package's 'run' function could execute malicious behavior when invoked. The script’s role is limited to package configuration and does not exhibit malicious intent on its own.",
