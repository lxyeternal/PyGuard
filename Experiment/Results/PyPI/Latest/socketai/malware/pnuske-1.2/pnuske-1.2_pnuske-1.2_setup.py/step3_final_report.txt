  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, find_packages(), and the entry point 'pnuske=pnuske:run'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or code execution occurs within this script.",
  "flows": "Defines package configuration and an entry point; actual execution occurs when CLI is invoked, outside this script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup code with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools. It imports standard functions, specifies package info, and defines a CLI entry point 'pnuske=pnuske:run'. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or insecure practices. The actual behavior when invoking 'pnuske' depends on the implementation of the 'pnuske' module's 'run' function, which is outside the scope of this static analysis. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as no malicious code is present in this script. The security risk score remains low (around 0.2) in some reports, reflecting potential runtime risks if the module is malicious, but the static setup code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign configuration with no malicious intent or security issues. The potential for malicious activity depends on the external 'pnuske' module's implementation, which is not part of this code. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and low obfuscation. The overall security posture based on this code is safe.",
