  "sources": "Import statement for setuptools; call to setup() with package information and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only configures package metadata and entry points.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic; straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and uses setup() to define a package named 'pnuske' with version 1.2, automatically finds packages, and sets up a console script entry point. No untrusted data handling, external network communication, or malicious behavior is present. The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
