{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'pnuske' Python project, including package discovery and console script entry point.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package configuration and defines entry points for command-line execution.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; the code only sets up packaging parameters.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from package definition to entry point setup; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setuptools functions and calls setup() with package metadata, discover packages with find_packages(), and defines a console script entry point 'pnuske=pnuske:run'. All elements are typical for Python package configuration. No suspicious behaviors, such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden network activity, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply configures the package's metadata and command-line interface.",
