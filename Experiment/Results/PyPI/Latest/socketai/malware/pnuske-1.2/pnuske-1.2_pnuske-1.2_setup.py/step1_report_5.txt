  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration for packaging and installing the 'pnuske' Python project with an entry point for command-line execution.",
  "sources": "Import statements from setuptools; find_packages() to locate packages; metadata such as name and version; entry_points for CLI script.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of the 'pnuske:run' function as a CLI command.",
  "flows": "Setup script imports setuptools, finds packages, and defines an entry point that executes 'pnuske:run' when the command 'pnuske' is invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup configuration with no suspicious code or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard packaging functions from setuptools, defines package metadata, and specifies a console script entry point that calls 'pnuske:run'. There are no embedded malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or external data interactions. The entry point relies on a function within the 'pnuske' module, which is typical for CLI tools. The setup process appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with a command-line interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this code.",
