  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign configuration with no malicious intent or security issues. The potential for malicious activity depends on the external 'pnuske' module's implementation, which is not part of this code. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and low obfuscation. The overall security posture based on this code is safe."
