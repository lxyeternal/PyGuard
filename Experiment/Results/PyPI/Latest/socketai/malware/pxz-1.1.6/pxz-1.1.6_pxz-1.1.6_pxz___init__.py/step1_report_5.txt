  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the definition of a function that generates and returns a greeting message, optionally customized with a provided name.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the function parameter 'name'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data via the return statement, which can be used elsewhere in the program.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'name' parameter to the formatted string returned by the function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and simple.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'greet' that takes an optional 'name' argument. If no name is provided, it defaults to 'World'. It then returns a greeting string incorporating the name. There are no input/output operations beyond parameter passing, no external data sources, and no suspicious constructs. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign and standard implementation of a greeting function with no malicious intent or security risks.",
