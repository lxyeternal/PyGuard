  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, network sockets, file operations, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, system commands, file writes, environment variable access, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data from input sources to sinks via processing functions, possibly passing through eval/exec or network modules.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, use of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, network activity on suspicious domains/IPs, lack of comments, ambiguous variable names.",
  "analysis": "Reports 1 and 2 show high suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution, with network activity indicating potential malicious intent; scores reflect these concerns. Reports 3, 4, and 5 show benign patterns with no suspicious behavior, and scores are consistent with their descriptions. The scores for reports 1 and 2 are justified by the described behaviors, while the others appropriately indicate low risk. Overall, the scores align with the evidence, with minor room for adjustment based on further code inspection.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits high suspicion in reports 1 and 2, warranting elevated malware and obfuscation scores, while the remaining reports are benign. The current scoring system accurately reflects the analyzed behaviors, with the overall security risk being moderate due to the potential threat in the suspicious reports.",
