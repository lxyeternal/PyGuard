      "conclusion": "The code performs silent, automated exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious. The behavior aligns with covert data collection typical of malware. Scores should be adjusted to reflect high suspicion and privacy risk, with malware around 0.5-0.6 and security risk around 0.75-0.8. The code is not obfuscated, and no malicious payloads are present, but its behavior is concerning enough to warrant high alert and further review."

      "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits high suspicion in reports 1 and 2, warranting elevated malware and obfuscation scores, while the remaining reports are benign. The current scoring system accurately reflects the analyzed behaviors, with the overall security risk being moderate due to the potential threat in the suspicious reports."
