{
  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to a specified server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current directory, user home directory, current time, and public IP address; constructs URL parameters for sending data.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET request with system info to a remote server URL.",
  "flows": "Reads system info → constructs URL → sends GET request to server.",
  "anomalies": "Automatically transmits potentially sensitive system information during package installation without user consent; hardcoded server URL; no clear user notification or opt-out mechanism.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system data such as public IP, hostname, directories, and current time, then sends it via an HTTP GET request to an internal IP address. This behavior resembles data exfiltration that occurs during package installation, which could be malicious or privacy-invasive. The use of a fixed internal IP address suggests the data is intended for a controlled server, but the mechanism of automatic data transmission without explicit user consent is suspicious. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present beyond this data collection and transmission behavior. The code’s purpose appears to be to silently collect and send system info, which is a security concern. The function is invoked at installation via a setup entry point, which can execute automatically during package installation, increasing risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs potentially malicious system info exfiltration during package installation, raising privacy and security concerns. It should be reviewed and possibly removed or modified to ensure user awareness and consent.",
