{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information such as public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, and current time, then sends this data to a specified server URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the internet (public IP via URL), local system information (hostname, directories), and current time.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via an HTTP GET request to a remote server (http://10.0.2.15:8080/collect_info.php).",
  "flows": "Source data (public IP, hostname, directories, time) is collected, formatted into URL parameters, and transmitted through an HTTP GET request to the specified server URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes network activity during package installation without user consent, which is unusual behavior for a typical package. The IP address is hardcoded to a private IP (10.0.2.15). The function call 'collect_system_info()' is triggered on install, which may be unexpected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs system information collection and transmits it to a remote server at install time, which is suspicious behavior for a publicly distributed package. It does not require external dependencies, avoiding obvious external requests besides the data collection. The use of urllib for network requests is standard, but the purpose of exfiltrating system info without user awareness is potentially malicious. The IP address is private, possibly indicating a controlled environment or malicious command and control server. The package setup includes an entry point that calls the info collection during installation, which is atypical and could be used for covert data gathering.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits potentially malicious behavior by collecting and transmitting system data silently during installation, which could be used for reconnaissance or data exfiltration. While technically not malware, this pattern is suspicious and could indicate malicious intent or privacy violations.",
