  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information and send it to a specified server when the package is installed.",
  "sources": "URLError from urllib.request, os.uname(), os.path.expanduser, os.getcwd(), datetime.now()",
  "sinks": "urlopen request to 'http://10.0.2.15:8080/collect_info.php' with system data as URL parameters",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() gathers system info -> encodes info into URL -> sends GET request to server_url",
  "anomalies": "The function collect_system_info() is called during package installation via on_install() entry point, which could be used for automated data exfiltration without user consent. No user prompts or permissions checks are present. The server URL is a local IP address, indicating controlled or potentially malicious infrastructure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a function to collect system info, including public IP, hostname, user home directory, current directory, and timestamp. It then constructs a GET request to a hardcoded IP address server to transmit this data. The collect_system_info() function is invoked during package installation via the specified console script entry point. No obfuscated code or complex logic is present. The code appears to exfiltrate system info silently, which could be malicious if done without user consent. The use of a local IP server for data collection may indicate malicious intent or a controlled environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects and exfiltrates system information during package installation without user interaction, which can be malicious behavior if intended for unauthorized data collection. The overall risk is moderate to high due to automated data transmission and lack of user awareness.",
