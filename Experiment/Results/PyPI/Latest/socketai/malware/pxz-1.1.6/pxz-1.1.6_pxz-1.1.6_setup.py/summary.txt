  "conclusion": "The code performs silent, automated exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious. The behavior aligns with covert data collection typical of malware. Scores should be adjusted to reflect high suspicion and privacy risk, with malware around 0.5-0.6 and security risk around 0.75-0.8. The code is not obfuscated, and no malicious payloads are present, but its behavior is concerning enough to warrant high alert and further review."
