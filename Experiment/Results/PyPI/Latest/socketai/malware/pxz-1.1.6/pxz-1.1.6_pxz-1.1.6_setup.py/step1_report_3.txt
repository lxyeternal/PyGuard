{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information (public IP, hostname, directories, current time) and send it to a specified server URL upon package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system info such as public IP via URL request, hostname via os.uname(), directories via os.path, and current time via datetime.now().",
  "sinks": "The data is sent through an HTTP GET request to a remote server (http://10.0.2.15:8080/collect_info.php).",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are collected and then concatenated into URL parameters; these parameters flow into the HTTP request to the remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code actively transmits potentially sensitive system information to an external server without user consent. No validation or encryption is used; the URL is hardcoded. The network communication occurs during package installation, which is unusual for benign packages.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system information such as public IP, hostname, directories, and timestamp. It then constructs a URL with these parameters and sends a GET request to a specified external server. The collection and transmission happen during the installation process via an entry point. The code does not include obfuscation, malicious code execution, or data exfiltration beyond the described info. It appears to purposefully gather and send system data, which could be considered malicious if done without user consent. The external server URL is hardcoded, and the communication occurs at install time, which can be suspicious behavior. There are no signs of code obfuscation or malicious payloads like reverse shells or data theft mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to silently collect and transmit system information to a remote server during package installation, which is suspicious behavior. This could be used for tracking or data exfiltration without user consent. It does not contain clear malware like backdoors or destructive payloads but does pose privacy concerns.",
