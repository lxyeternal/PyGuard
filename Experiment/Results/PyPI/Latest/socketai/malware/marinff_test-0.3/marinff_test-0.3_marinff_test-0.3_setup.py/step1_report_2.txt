  "purpose": "Custom installation process that establishes a reverse shell connection during package installation.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded IP address (LHOST), hardcoded port (LPORT), base64-encoded reverse shell command.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded base64 payload which initiates reverse shell.",
  "flows": "Encoding reverse shell command -> decoding via base64 in os.system -> execution of reverse shell payload.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of reverse shell payload during package installation, use of base64 encoding to obfuscate malicious command, hardcoded IP and port for reverse connection.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the installation process to run a reverse shell command. It constructs a reverse shell command targeting a specific IP and port, encodes it in base64 to evade immediate detection, and executes it via os.system after decoding. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it establishes an unauthorized remote access during package setup, which is highly suspicious and malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious backdoor that initiates a reverse shell during installation, representing a serious security risk. The use of obfuscation and hardcoded connection details confirms malicious intent. This package should be considered dangerous and should not be used.",
