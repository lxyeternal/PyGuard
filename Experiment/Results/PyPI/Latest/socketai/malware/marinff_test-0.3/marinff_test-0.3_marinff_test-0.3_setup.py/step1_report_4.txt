{
  "purpose": "Setup script that installs a Python module and executes a reverse shell upon installation.",
  "sources": "Reverse shell command constructed and executed during the install process.",
  "sinks": "os.system call that executes base64-decoded shell command, leading to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Constructed base64-encoded reverse shell command is decoded and executed via os.system, establishing a reverse connection.",
  "anomalies": "Includes hardcoded IP address and port for reverse shell; code to automatically connect back to attacker's server during install; use of base64 encoding to obfuscate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, after running the standard installation, creates a reverse shell command targeting a specific IP and port. The command is base64-encoded to hide its purpose, then decoded and executed via os.system. This results in automatic initiation of a reverse connection to an external server during package installation, which is malicious behavior. The code attempts to conceal its intent through encoding but reveals malicious intent through its reverse shell payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious reverse shell triggered during package installation, indicating an intentional supply chain attack. It is highly suspicious and malicious, designed to give an attacker remote access to the host upon package installation.",
