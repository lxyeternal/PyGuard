{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package and execute a reverse shell during installation.",
  "sources": "LHOST and LPORT variables, encoded reverse_shell string, os.system call executing the decoded base64 payload",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a base64-decoded script that initiates a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes it via a shell command, and executes it, resulting in a reverse shell connection",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded IP and port, execution of a base64-encoded command during setup, reverse shell payload embedded directly in setup script, intentional concealment of malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, upon running, constructs a reverse shell command targeting IP 192.168.239.158 on port 8867. It encodes this command in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system. This behavior is unusual and suspicious for a setup script, indicating an attempt to establish remote access without user consent. The use of base64 encoding and execution during installation strongly suggests malicious intent to facilitate unauthorized access.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by embedding and executing a reverse shell payload during package installation. It appears designed to compromise systems where the package is installed by establishing a remote connection to a specified IP address, indicating a clear security threat.",
