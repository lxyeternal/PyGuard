{
  "purpose": "The code aims to establish a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port during package installation, potentially allowing remote control of the host system.",
  "sources": "The code reads static IP and port variables, constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, and executes it via os.system during setup.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes the decoded base64 payload, which initiates a reverse shell, providing remote access and control.",
  "flows": "Source: static IP/port variables -> payload string construction -> base64 encoding -> decoding during runtime -> execution via os.system -> reverse shell connection to attacker-controlled server.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a typo 'secket' instead of 'socket' causes runtime error; minimal obfuscation through base64 encoding; malicious intent is clear despite the typo.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a reverse shell command with hardcoded IP and port, encodes it in base64, and executes it during installation. The typo 'secket' would prevent execution unless corrected, indicating possible obfuscation or poor coding. The malicious pattern is evident: remote code execution during setup, enabling potential unauthorized access. The base64 encoding provides minimal obfuscation. The high confidence in malicious intent is justified, and the security risk is severe due to remote control capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to establish a reverse shell during package installation, representing a serious supply chain security threat. Despite the typo, the intent is clear, and the malicious behavior warrants a malware score of 1, a high security risk score of 1, and an obfuscation score around 0.8 to 0.9 due to base64 encoding.",
