{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the standard setup process to execute a reverse shell upon installation, potentially allowing remote access to the system where the package is installed.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input but generates a reverse shell command string internally. It does not accept external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a base64-decoded shell command that establishes a reverse shell connection, which can give remote control to an attacker.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command string, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system, resulting in remote access capability upon package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a hardcoded IP address and port, and executes a reverse shell command during setup, which is highly suspicious. Also, there is a typo in 'socket(secket.AF_INET...' which would cause runtime error, indicating malicious intent may be obfuscated or the code is intentionally malformed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, attempts to run a reverse shell by constructing a Python command string. The command connects back to a specified IP and port, providing remote shell access. It encodes this command in base64 for execution. The hardcoded IP address and port, combined with the execution of a reverse shell during setup, indicate malicious behavior. The typo in 'socket(secket...' suggests either obfuscation or poorly written malicious code, aiming to evade detection or cause failure. Overall, the code's intent appears to be unauthorized remote access, constituting a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious code that executes a reverse shell during installation, allowing remote control of the host system. The code is suspicious due to its intent, hardcoded malicious parameters, and execution of shell commands during setup.",
