{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package that, upon installation, executes a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it uses hardcoded IP (LHOST) and port (LPORT) variables within the CustomInstall class.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a base64-decoded command that initiates a reverse shell connection to a remote server, potentially leading to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system, creating a source-to-sink flow that results in establishing a remote connection.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of hardcoded IP and port for reverse shell, construction of a base64-encoded command executed during installation, and the malicious intent of establishing remote access without user consent are highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation routine that, after performing standard installation steps, creates a reverse shell command aimed at a specific IP address and port. This command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed with os.system, establishing a reverse shell connection to an attacker-controlled machine. The use of hardcoded network parameters, combined with execution during package installation, indicates malicious intent to provide unauthorized remote access. No other benign functionalities are present. The overall structure and behavior strongly suggest malicious intent with a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to create a reverse shell to a fixed IP address during installation, representing a significant security threat. It can allow unauthorized remote control of the host system. The package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
