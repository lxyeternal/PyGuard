  "purpose": "Simple script to print 'hello world' to the console.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or places where untrusted data could cause data leaks or effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as none exist in the code.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a syntax error in the line 'if __name__ = \"__main__\":' — should be 'if __name__ == \"__main__\":'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function to print a greeting. The main guard is incorrectly written, which will cause a syntax error during execution, preventing the script from running successfully. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is simple and straightforward but contains a syntax error that needs correction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic Hello World script with a syntax mistake; it does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The primary issue is the incorrect main guard syntax, which should be corrected for proper execution.",
