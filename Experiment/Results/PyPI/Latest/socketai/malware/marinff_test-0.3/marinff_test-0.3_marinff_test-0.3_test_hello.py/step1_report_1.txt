  "purpose": "Simple script to print 'hello world' when executed as the main program.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could be processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths in the code.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in the if statement: should be '==' instead of '='; no other unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function 'hello' that prints a message. The main guard is incorrectly written as 'if __name__ = \"__main__\":' which is a syntax error in Python. This would prevent the script from executing as intended. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is simple and does not perform any data processing, network communication, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign and only prints a message. The syntax error prevents execution but does not introduce malicious behavior. Overall security risk is negligible.",
