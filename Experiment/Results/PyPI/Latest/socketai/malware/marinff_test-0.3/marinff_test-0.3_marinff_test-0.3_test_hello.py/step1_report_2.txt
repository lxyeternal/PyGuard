{
  "purpose": "Simple script to print 'hello world' when executed directly",
  "sources": "The script reads no external input or data sources",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to the console via print statement",
  "flows": "N/A, no untrusted data flow present",
  "anomalies": "Typo in the main check ('=' instead of '==') which causes a syntax error",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function 'hello' that prints a greeting. The main guard attempts to run 'hello' if the script is executed directly. However, there is a syntax error: 'if __name__ = \"__main__\":' should be 'if __name__ == \"__main__\":'. This mistake prevents the script from executing as intended. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is very simple and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic Hello World script with a syntax error due to a typo. No malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation detected. The main issue is the typo which needs correction to run properly.",
