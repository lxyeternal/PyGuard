{
  "purpose": "Defines a simple function to print 'hello world' and executes it if the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "Input is not explicitly read; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The only output is to the console via print(), which is not a security risk.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Syntax error in the line 'if __name__ = \"__main__\":'. The correct syntax should use '==' for comparison.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to define a basic function and execute it as a script. However, due to a syntax mistake in the conditional statement, the script will raise a SyntaxError at runtime, preventing execution. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is simple and benign but contains a syntax error that would need correction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign script with a syntax error in the main guard statement. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks but is improperly formatted.",
