  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'uus' that customizes the installation process to run a main() function from the main module after installation.",
  "sources": "import statements, class definition, setup() function call",
  "sinks": "Calling main() function from the main module during installation",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method of CrazyInstallStrat executes, which then imports and calls main() from main module",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes code (main()) during installation, which is unusual and potentially suspicious; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines a custom installation class that runs the main() function from the main module post-installation. This behavior is uncommon in typical setup scripts, which usually only handle packaging and installation. The main() function's actions are not visible here, but executing code during setup can be used maliciously if main() performs undesired operations. The setup configuration appears standard otherwise, with typical metadata and dependencies. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious external communications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary suspicious aspect is executing the main() function during installation, which could potentially be malicious if main() performs harmful actions. However, without visibility into main(), the risk cannot be definitively assessed. The rest of the script appears standard.",
