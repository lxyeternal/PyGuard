  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to multiple remote URLs, possibly for tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() - sending data to external URLs",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, random number) collected and sent via GET request to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious URLs, sending host/user info without encryption, reliance on random number for URL parameter, no user consent indication",
  "analysis": "The script gathers basic system info including hostname, username, and current directory. It generates a random number for each request and constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains. It then performs HTTP GET requests to these URLs with system info as query parameters, potentially leaking sensitive information or conducting malicious reconnaissance. The URLs are suspicious and likely involved in tracking or malicious activity. No obfuscated code or complex logic is present; the behavior appears to be data exfiltration or tracking, raising security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for malicious tracking or reconnaissance by sending system info to suspicious domains. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code per se but performs potentially harmful data transmission without user consent. The activity warrants security review and potential blocking.",
