  "anomalies": "Sends system info to multiple external domains without user consent; use of multiple suspicious domains; dynamic URL construction with random number",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, and current directory, then constructs URLs with these parameters along with a random number. It sends HTTP GET requests to external domains, which are suspicious due to their non-standard, random, or possibly malicious domains. The code does not validate or restrict data, nor does it handle the responses meaningfully, indicating potential data exfiltration or tracking. The URL domains appear malicious or at least suspicious, and the code behavior resembles known tracking or C2 activities. No malicious payload or backdoor code is present, but the behavior indicates privacy invasion and possible command-and-control communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect and send system information to external servers without user consent, likely for tracking or malicious purposes. The use of suspicious domains and data exfiltration patterns raises security concerns. No direct malware actions like file modification or command execution are present, but the privacy-invasive behavior warrants caution.",
