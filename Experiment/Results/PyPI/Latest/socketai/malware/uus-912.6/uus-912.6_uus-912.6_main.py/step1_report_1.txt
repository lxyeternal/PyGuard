{
  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple external URLs for tracking or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests to external URLs with system info and a random number as part of the URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info and random number are gathered (sources) and included in URL parameters, then HTTP requests are made to external servers (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "The code contacts multiple external domains, including ones with suspicious or untrusted domain names. The URLs include a random number, possibly for cache busting or tracking. No user input validation, and no clear purpose other than data exfiltration or tracking. The external URLs are potentially malicious or at least suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script collects host name, username, current directory, and generates a random number, then constructs URLs pointing to seemingly suspicious or unknown external domains. It sends GET requests to these URLs with the collected data as URL parameters. The code does not perform any validation, sanitization, or user interaction. The URLs are unusual, and the pattern suggests tracking or data exfiltration. No malicious code execution is observed, but the pattern of contacting multiple external servers with system info indicates potential malicious intent or at least privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be collecting system information and sending it to external domains without user consent, which is suspicious. The presence of multiple external URLs and data exfiltration pattern raises concerns about privacy violations or malicious tracking behavior. No direct malware actions such as damaging files or system access are detected, but the activity is potentially malicious in nature.",
