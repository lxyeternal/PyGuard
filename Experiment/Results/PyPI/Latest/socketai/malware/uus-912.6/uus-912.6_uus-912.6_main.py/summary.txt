  "conclusion": "The code performs suspicious data collection and transmission to untrusted domains, indicating potential privacy invasion or malicious reconnaissance. While it lacks malicious payloads or obfuscation, its activity pattern is concerning. Malware scores should be adjusted upward to approximately 0.75 to reflect the malicious-like behavior, and security risk scores are justified at 0.75–0.8. The activity warrants further review and caution but does not constitute definitive malware."
