{
  "purpose": "The code executes an external Windows executable ('libs/windows.exe') during installation without validation, posing a security risk.",
  "sources": "The executable path 'libs/windows.exe' checked with os.path.exists and run via subprocess.run.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the external executable without validation or user consent.",
  "flows": "Code checks for the executable's existence, then runs it directly if found.",
  "anomalies": "Running an external binary during setup without checksum, signature verification, or sandboxing.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, after standard setup, looks for 'libs/windows.exe' and executes it if present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The key concern is executing an external file without validation, which could be malicious or tampered with. The behavior is suspicious and aligns with tactics used in supply chain attacks or malware distribution. The scores from reports (malware ~0.7, risk ~0.75) are justified given the behavior, though without inspecting the executable, malicious intent cannot be confirmed. The code itself is benign but risky due to the external execution step.",
  "conclusion": "The code's behavior of executing an unverified external executable during installation constitutes a significant security concern, potentially malicious. The current scores are appropriate; elevating malware suspicion slightly to 0.75 and risk to 0.8 is justified given the high potential for malicious activity. Further validation of the executable is recommended to mitigate supply chain risks.",
