  "conclusion": "The code's behavior of executing an unverified external executable during installation constitutes a significant security concern, potentially malicious. The current scores are appropriate; elevating malware suspicion slightly to 0.75 and risk to 0.8 is justified given the high potential for malicious activity. Further validation of the executable is recommended to mitigate supply chain risks."
