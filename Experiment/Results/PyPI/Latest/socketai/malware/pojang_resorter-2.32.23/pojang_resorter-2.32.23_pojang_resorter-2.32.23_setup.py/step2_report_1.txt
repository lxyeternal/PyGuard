  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the evidence, logic, and scoring.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n- All reports identify the core behavior: during package installation, the script checks for and executes an external Windows executable located in 'libs/windows.exe'.\n- They agree that this behavior is unusual, potentially malicious, and poses a security risk.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.8), and the malware scores range from 0.3 to 0.75, with most at 0.7.\n- The obfuscation scores are zero, indicating the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code indeed reads the executable path and runs it during the custom install process (`subprocess.run([exe_path], check=True)`).\n- No validation, checksum, or signature verification is performed on the executable.\n- The executable is located in a 'libs' subfolder, which is not inherently suspicious but becomes risky when executed without validation.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report:\n- The reports correctly identify the security concern but sometimes imply that the executable might be malicious without concrete evidence. However, since the executable's nature is unknown, the suspicion is justified.\n- The reasoning is consistent; no logical errors are apparent.\n\n### Scores review:\n- The malware scores are mostly 0.7, with one at 0.5 and one at 0.3.\n- Given the behavior (executing an external binary during install without validation), a malware score of **0.7** is justified, as this is a significant security concern.\n- The report with malware score 0.5 seems slightly conservative; I would increase it to 0.75 to reflect the high risk.\n- The obfuscation scores are 0, which aligns with the code clarity.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Executing an external executable during package installation is a common tactic for supply chain attacks or malware distribution.\n- The lack of validation or user consent increases the potential for malicious activity.\n- The executable could be malicious, or an attacker could replace it, making the risk high.\n\n### Malware score consistency:\n- The highest malware score (0.75) aligns with the behavior: executing an unverified external binary.\n- The lower scores (0.3, 0.5) seem underestimated; I would elevate all to 0.75 for consistency and to reflect the severity.\n\n### Potential false assumptions:\n- The reports assume the executable is malicious or could be malicious, which is reasonable given the behavior.\n- No assumptions are made about the executable's content; the concern is about the behavior itself.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The core issue is the execution of an external binary during setup without validation.\n- The code is straightforward; no obfuscation or hidden malicious code is present.\n- The risk stems solely from the behavior.\n\n---\n\n## My own estimates:\n\n| Score Type        | Reasoning                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**      | **0.75** — Executing an external, unverified executable during install is a high-risk behavior. It can be malicious or exploited for malicious purposes. |\n| **Obfuscated**   | **0** — The code is clear and straightforward.                                                 |\n| **Risk**         | **0.8** — The behavior introduces a serious security risk, especially in supply chain contexts. |\n\n---\n\n## Final notes:\n- The behavior warrants a high malware and risk score.\n- The execution of an external binary during setup without validation is a red flag.\n- The reports are accurate; I would slightly increase the malware score to 0.75 for consistency.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code's behavior of executing an external executable during installation is a significant security concern, potentially malicious, and should be flagged accordingly. The current scores are reasonable but could be slightly elevated for clarity and consistency.",
