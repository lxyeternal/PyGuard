{
  "purpose": "Provides a basic package setup for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, defining version and author information.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'main' module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling; the code only imports and defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets (besides version and author info), or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, establishing package metadata and importing a main module. No input/output, external network calls, or obfuscated code. The import statement suggests reliance on internal modules. The metadata is static and not suspicious. The structure and content are typical for a Python package setup.\n\nNo signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are present. The code is straightforward and clean, with no indicators of obfuscation or malware.\n\nBased on the provided snippet, there is no malicious intent or security concern detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization file with no malicious behavior or security issues. It merely imports a main module and sets package metadata.",
