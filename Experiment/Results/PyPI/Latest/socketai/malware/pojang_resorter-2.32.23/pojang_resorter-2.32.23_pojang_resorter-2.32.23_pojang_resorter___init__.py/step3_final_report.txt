{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal package initialization file, importing a local main module and setting static metadata (__version__ and __author__).",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata variables (__version__, __author__) and imports a local module (.main).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "The code imports a local module and assigns static metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package setup script, importing a local module and defining static metadata. It contains no external network activity, data processing, or obfuscated code. The import is from a local module, reducing risk. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores from the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization file with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
