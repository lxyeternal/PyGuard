{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Imports 'main' from the local module .main",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only metadata assignment and import statement",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and minimal, with no hidden or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports a main function from a local module. It does not process input, handle untrusted data, or perform any operations that could be malicious. The import is local and standard, and there are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. The code's structure and content are typical for a package's __init__.py file, serving as entry point and metadata holder.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple package initialization file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It merely imports a main function and sets metadata, with no indications of security risks or malware.",
