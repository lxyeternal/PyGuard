  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal, standard package setup, importing a local module and defining metadata.\n- No external network activity, data processing, or untrusted data handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets (beyond version and author info), or malicious patterns.\n- The import is from a local module (.main), which reduces risk compared to external sources.\n- The code structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or entry point.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippets provided match the description: simple import and metadata assignment.\n- No issues are present in the code itself; the logic is straightforward and safe.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and typical.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: mostly 0, with one report at 0.1 (likely due to conservative default or minor metadata consideration)\n\n- These scores seem reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since there's no malicious behavior, no external communication, and no suspicious patterns, a **risk score of 0** is appropriate.\n- The report with 0.1 risk score might be overly cautious; a score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Malware Score:\n- All reports correctly identify malware as 0, which is accurate.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities:\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code.\n- The code is not obfuscated, nor does it perform any suspicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a straightforward package initialization file with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
