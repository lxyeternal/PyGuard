{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, mainly by importing the main function and setting metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main import main",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs observed",
  "flows": "None, as the code only imports a function and sets metadata; no data flow paths are present",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or malicious code, no network activity or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and imports a main function from a local module. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are present. The only notable actions are setting version and author metadata, and importing a main function, which is typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package initialization code with no malicious intent or security risks. There are no indicators of malware, suspicious data flows, or security vulnerabilities.",
