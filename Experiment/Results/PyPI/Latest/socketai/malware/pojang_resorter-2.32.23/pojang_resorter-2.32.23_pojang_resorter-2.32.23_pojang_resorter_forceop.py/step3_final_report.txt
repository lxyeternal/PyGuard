  "purpose": "A minimal script to assign operator privileges to a specified user via command-line input.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument 'username' input via argparse",
  "sinks": "Print statement indicating privilege assignment",
  "flows": "Input from command-line argument -> assign_operator() function -> print output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code accepts a username as input and prints a message confirming privilege assignment. It does not perform any privilege escalation, system modifications, network activity, or handle sensitive data insecurely. The script is simple, clear, and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that only outputs a message. There is no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
