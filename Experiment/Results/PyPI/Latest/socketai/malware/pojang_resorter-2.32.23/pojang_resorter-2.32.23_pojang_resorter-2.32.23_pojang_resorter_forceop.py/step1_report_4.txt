  "purpose": "Assigns operator privileges to a specified user via command-line argument.",
  "sources": "Reads the username from command-line arguments using argparse.",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs the assignment message to standard output.",
  "flows": "User provides username -> argparse captures username -> assign_operator function prints confirmation message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code only prints a message and does not perform actual privilege assignment or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code takes a username as input via command-line argument and outputs a confirmation message indicating operator privileges are assigned. It does not perform any actual privilege escalation, system modifications, or network activity. The use of print is benign. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or external communication, are present. Overall, the code appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple command-line utility that prints a message indicating privilege assignment. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears legitimate and safe for intended use.",
