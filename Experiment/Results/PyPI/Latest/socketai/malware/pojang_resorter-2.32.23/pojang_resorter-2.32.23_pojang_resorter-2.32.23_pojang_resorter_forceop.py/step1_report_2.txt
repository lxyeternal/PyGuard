  "purpose": "The script assigns operator privileges to a specified username via command-line input.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line argument 'username' using argparse.",
  "sinks": "Uses the username input in a print statement to indicate privilege assignment.",
  "flows": "Command-line input ('username') flows directly into the assign_operator function and is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, and no external network interactions. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, taking a username input and printing a confirmation message. There are no data leaks, network calls, or code execution beyond printing. The only operation is a print statement, which is not inherently malicious. The function name and description suggest role assignment, but without actual privilege escalation logic, it appears benign. No anomalies such as embedded secrets or unusual constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple utility to acknowledge the assignment of operator privileges without performing actual privilege changes or malicious activities. No security threats or malware indications detected.",
