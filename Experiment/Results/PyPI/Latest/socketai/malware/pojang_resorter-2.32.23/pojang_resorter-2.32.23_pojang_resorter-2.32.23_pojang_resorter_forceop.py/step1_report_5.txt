{
  "purpose": "The script assigns operator privileges to a specified user based on command-line input.",
  "sources": "Reads username input from command-line arguments via argparse.",
  "sinks": "Outputs messages to the console using print(), which is not a security sink but indicates user feedback.",
  "flows": "User provides username via command line → assign_operator() function is called with this username → message printed to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code does not perform any network activity, file manipulation, or system changes beyond printing a message.",
  "analysis": "The code uses argparse to accept a username parameter and then prints a message indicating privilege assignment. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network communications. The code is straightforward and appears to be a utility for user privilege assignment. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple privilege assignment notification with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign utility script without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
