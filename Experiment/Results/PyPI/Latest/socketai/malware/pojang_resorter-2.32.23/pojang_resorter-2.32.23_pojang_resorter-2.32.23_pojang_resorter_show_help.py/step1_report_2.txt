{
  "purpose": "The script provides a CLI interface for a Python-Mojang interaction tool, mainly displaying help information with ASCII art and colored text.",
  "sources": "User input through command-line arguments processed by argparse.",
  "sinks": "The command-line arguments parsed by argparse could influence program flow, but no untrusted data is executed or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input via command-line arguments flows from argparse to subcommand handlers, which only display help information.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. ASCII art and colored text are purely aesthetic. No suspicious external calls or data exfiltration is present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored output, then defines a function to show a help message with ASCII art and command options. The help message is static, with no dynamic or external code execution. The command options are standard CLI help commands. The code strictly handles display logic without performing any operations on user data beyond argument parsing, and it does not invoke any external or network activities. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help display script with no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It is purely aesthetic and informational.",
