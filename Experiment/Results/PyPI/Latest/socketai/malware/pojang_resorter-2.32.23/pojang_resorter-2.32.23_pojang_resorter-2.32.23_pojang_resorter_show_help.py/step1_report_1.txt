{
  "purpose": "To display a colored ASCII art header and help information for a CLI tool with multiple subcommands related to server and user management.",
  "sources": "Input comes from command-line arguments processed by argparse; ASCII art is hardcoded within the script.",
  "sinks": "Printing to console; no untrusted data is outputted or sent over network.",
  "flows": "User input (CLI arguments) is used solely to determine which help message to display; no data flows into or out of the system beyond this.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs are present. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. No obfuscated or malicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes color output with colorama, defines a function to display a stylized ASCII art header along with command descriptions, and prints help information for various subcommands. The command descriptions are static, and the ASCII art is hardcoded. No user input is processed beyond displaying help, and no data is read from or written to external sources or network endpoints. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help display script with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It only prints static ASCII art and command descriptions based on user invocation. No evidence of malware, backdoors, data leakage, or security risks is present.",
