  "purpose": "Display static ASCII art and command help information for a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded ASCII art string and argparse command definitions.",
  "sinks": "Console output via print statements.",
  "flows": "Static ASCII art and command descriptions are printed directly; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama, defines a function to display ASCII art and help info, and uses argparse for command handling. It outputs static content without external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are present. The code's purpose is purely aesthetic and informational.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI help utility that displays static ASCII art and command descriptions. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk present.",
