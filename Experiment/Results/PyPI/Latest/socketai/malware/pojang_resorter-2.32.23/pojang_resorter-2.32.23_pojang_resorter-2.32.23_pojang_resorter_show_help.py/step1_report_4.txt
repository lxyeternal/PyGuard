{
  "purpose": "Provides a CLI help menu with ASCII art and command descriptions for a Python-Mojang interaction tool.",
  "sources": "argparse library (user input via command-line arguments), colorama library (initialization for colored output).",
  "sinks": "Print statements (console output), argparse.print_help() (displaying help message).",
  "flows": "User input via command-line arguments flows into argparse parsing, which then triggers display of ASCII art and help info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code present. The code mainly displays static ASCII art and help info.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama for colored output, defines a function to display ASCII art with colored headers, sets up argparse to handle subcommands, and prints the ASCII art along with command descriptions. No user input is processed beyond argument parsing, and there are no data leaks or external connections. The code appears to be a benign CLI help utility with no malicious behavior or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI help menu implementation with colored ASCII art, and it does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply displays static information and handles command-line arguments for help display.",
