  "sinks": "exec() function executing decoded payload, potential for arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "Reversal of string -> base64 decode -> zlib decompress -> exec() on resulting code.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation through string reversal, layered decoding, and dynamic import; no visible payload code.",
  "analysis": "The code reverses a long base64-encoded string, decodes it, decompresses with zlib, and executes the resulting code via exec(). The obfuscation pattern is consistent with malicious loaders designed to conceal payloads. The use of exec() on dynamically decoded data indicates high malicious potential. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9-1, obfuscated ~0.8-0.9, risk ~0.85-1) are justified given the behavior. The code matches common malware obfuscation and payload delivery techniques, with no false positives evident. The high confidence (around 0.9) in maliciousness is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, employing heavy obfuscation and dynamic execution of an unknown payload, characteristic of malware loaders. The scores should reflect maximum threat levels, with malware and risk scores at 1.0, and obfuscation near 0.9. Overall, it poses a severe security risk and should be treated as malicious.",
