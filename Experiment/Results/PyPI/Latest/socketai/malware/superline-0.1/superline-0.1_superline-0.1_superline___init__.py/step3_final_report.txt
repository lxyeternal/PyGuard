  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local 'main' module using a relative import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential namespace pollution; if 'main' contains malicious code or side effects, they could be executed upon import.",
  "flows": "Importing from '.main' can trigger execution of top-level code in 'main', leading to possible side effects or malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure symbol origins and potentially import malicious or unintended symbols if 'main' is compromised; no obfuscation or malicious code is directly visible.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from the 'main' module. This practice can lead to namespace pollution and potentially execute malicious code if 'main' contains harmful top-level statements. The import itself is benign, but the security implications depend on the trustworthiness of 'main'. The malware score is set to 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent in this snippet. The risk score is modest (around 0.2-0.3), reflecting the potential danger if 'main' is malicious. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation detected. Confidence in benignity is high, but caution is warranted regarding the imported module's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement, but it carries a moderate security risk if the 'main' module is compromised or malicious. The malware score remains at 0, and the obfuscation score is 0. The risk score should be adjusted to approximately 0.2 to account for potential malicious side effects during import. Overall, the snippet itself is safe, but the trustworthiness of 'main' is critical.",
