{
  "purpose": "The code imports all components from a module named 'main', likely to include functions, classes, or variables into the current namespace.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement from '.main', which loads code from a sibling module in the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing code from 'main' into the current namespace; no untrusted data flows are visible here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual language features, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded secrets are evident. The use of 'import *' can be considered a bad practice but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of an import statement. It imports all symbols from a sibling module named 'main'. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic within this single line. Since it only performs a standard import, there are no apparent security issues or malicious behaviors. However, the use of 'import *' can potentially introduce namespace pollution or hidden dependencies but does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, performing a simple import operation. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this single line. The overall security risk is very low, with no malware indicators. The confidence in this assessment is high.",
