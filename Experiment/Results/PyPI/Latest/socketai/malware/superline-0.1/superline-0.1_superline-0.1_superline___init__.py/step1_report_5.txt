  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement which includes everything from the 'main' module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if 'main' contains untrusted data handling, that could be a sink, but not directly from this statement.",
  "flows": "Data flow depends entirely on the imported 'main' module, which is not provided.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and only imports another module; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident in this single line.",
  "analysis": "The statement is a standard Python import statement using relative import syntax. Without access to the 'main' module, it is impossible to evaluate for malicious behavior. The line itself does not perform any malicious activity or suspicious operation. It is a common way to include code from another module within the same package.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a typical import, and further analysis would require inspecting the contents of 'main'.",
