  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement, but it carries a moderate security risk if the 'main' module is compromised or malicious. The malware score remains at 0, and the obfuscation score is 0. The risk score should be adjusted to approximately 0.2 to account for potential malicious side effects during import. Overall, the snippet itself is safe, but the trustworthiness of 'main' is critical."
