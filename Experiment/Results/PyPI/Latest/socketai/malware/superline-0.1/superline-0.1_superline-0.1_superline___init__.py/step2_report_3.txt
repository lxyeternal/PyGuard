  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the validity of conclusions.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the import of all symbols from `.main`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct sinks or explicit data flows, as expected.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes that wildcard imports can obscure code origins and potentially import malicious symbols if the module is compromised. This is a valid concern, especially in security-sensitive contexts.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is benign but warns about namespace pollution risks. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 (correct)\n  - obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (low, considering the wildcard import concern)\n  - confidence: 0.6 (moderate, due to the wildcard import concern)\n  \n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the import from `.main`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No explicit sinks; import is straightforward.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights that 'import *' is bad practice but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Emphasizes benign nature, high confidence.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - securityRisk: 0 (low, standard import)\n  - confidence: 1 (high, no suspicion)\n  \n**Verdict:** Well justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes potential for code execution upon import if 'main' contains such code.\n- **Anomalies:** Recognizes risks associated with 'import *' and dynamic code execution.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that risk depends on 'main's content, which is unknown.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0 (since no evidence of malicious code)\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.3 (moderate, due to potential risk if 'main' is malicious)\n  - confidence: 0.4 (lower, because of uncertainty)\n  \n**Verdict:** Reasonable, but perhaps the securityRisk score could be slightly higher if the risk of malicious code in 'main' is considered.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No explicit sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, standard import.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n  \n**Verdict:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No explicit sinks; depends on 'main'.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that the import itself isn't suspicious; risk depends on 'main'.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 0.3 (low, due to lack of info)\n  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- The code is straightforward, and none of the reports find evidence of malicious activity based solely on this import statement.\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious symbols if the 'main' module is compromised, but this cannot be confirmed from this snippet alone.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the limited context.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential issues with wildcard imports and reliance on external modules, a moderate risk score of around **0.2-0.3** could be justified, especially in security-critical environments.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (considering the wildcard import concern but no direct malicious activity)\n\nThis aligns with the assessments in the reports, emphasizing that the snippet is benign but with some best-practice concerns regarding import practices.",
