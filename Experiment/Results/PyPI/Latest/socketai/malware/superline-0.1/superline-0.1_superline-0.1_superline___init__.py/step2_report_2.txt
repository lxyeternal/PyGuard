  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .main import *\n```\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code performs a relative import of all symbols from the 'main' module.\n- No runtime behavior, data flows, or malicious payloads are visible in this single line.\n- The primary concern with such imports is namespace pollution and potential inclusion of malicious code if the 'main' module is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate, standard import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct sinks or flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import can be risky.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the risk of namespace pollution; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.6\n\n**Assessment:** The low malware score is appropriate; the risk score is modest, reflecting the potential danger of wildcard imports. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct sinks; import is straightforward.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of 'import *' is considered bad practice but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly states the benign nature; high confidence.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment aligns with the code. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Import could lead to code execution if 'main' contains side effects.\n- **Anomalies:** Risks associated with 'import *' are noted.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately emphasizes that risk depends on 'main's content.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.3, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.4\n\n**Assessment:** The risk score of 0.3 is reasonable, given the potential for side effects during import. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard import; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical import; cannot evaluate 'main' contents.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.3\n\n**Assessment:** The low confidence and zero risk are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code snippet alone shows no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Most are low, reflecting the potential issues with wildcard imports but not indicating actual malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** Given the potential for namespace pollution and side effects during import, I would assign a **risk score of around 0.2 to 0.3** for this snippet, reflecting moderate concern about the import practice but not actual malicious intent.\n\n**Justification:**  \n- The code itself is benign.  \n- Wildcard imports can be dangerous if the 'main' module is compromised or malicious, but there's no evidence of malicious code here.  \n- The risk is primarily due to coding practice rather than active threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** ~0.2 to 0.3 (I suggest 0.25 as a balanced estimate)\n\nThis cautious approach accounts for the potential risks associated with such import practices without overestimating threat levels based solely on this line.",
