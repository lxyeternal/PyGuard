{
  "purpose": "The code imports all definitions from the 'main' module in the same package, likely to use or execute code defined there.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.main'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this snippet; potential sinks depend on the imported module's content",
  "flows": "Importing all from '.main' could lead to execution of code or functions upon import, depending on 'main'",
  "anomalies": "Using 'from .main import *' is risky because it can introduce unintended code execution or namespace pollution; however, the snippet itself is minimal",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement that brings in all definitions from the local 'main' module. This is common in Python but can be dangerous if 'main' contains malicious code or side effects that execute upon import. No explicit data flows or suspicious behavior is visible in this fragment alone. Since no other code is present, the risk depends heavily on the content of the 'main' module. The import statement itself is standard, but if 'main' includes malicious code or backdoors, that would pose a security threat. The minimal code limits analysis to the import mechanism and potential execution upon import.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet by itself is benign but potentially risky if the imported module 'main' contains malicious code or performs unwanted actions upon import. Additional context about 'main' is necessary for a complete security assessment.",
