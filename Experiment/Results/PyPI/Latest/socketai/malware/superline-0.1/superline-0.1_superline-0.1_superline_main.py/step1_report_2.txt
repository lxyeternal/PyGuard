{
  "purpose": "The script functions as a comprehensive data stealer and backdoor tool, designed to exfiltrate system information, user data, browser credentials, cookies, sessions, and other sensitive information, then transmit it to a command and control (C2) server or upload it to external services. It also contains mechanisms to bypass security features, persist on startup, and inject malicious code into Discord installations.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from user directories (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc.), browser profile folders (Chrome, Firefox, Chromium, etc.), system commands (systeminfo, getmac, tasklist, WMIC queries), web requests (IP geolocation, network info), and file system (browser databases, cookies, session files, system info logs). It also reads environment variables, registry data, clipboard content, and process lists.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into exfiltration points such as uploading files to external services (gofile, anonfiles), sending HTTP POST requests to C2 URLs (Discord webhook, Telegram bot API), writing collected data into files, and executing system commands (taskkill, PowerShell, compressed archive creation, process injection, malicious DLL/EXE execution). It also performs code injection into Discord desktop app folders and executes bound executable files obtained from decompressed, reversed content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser profiles, system info, clipboard, network credentials, and session files into exfiltration channels (HTTP requests to C2, uploads to file hosting services). It also involves injection of malicious scripts into Discord index.js files, and execution of the 'bound.exe' payload which is decompressed and executed locally. Some functions kill or manipulate system processes and modify system files to ensure persistence or stealth.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated or encoded PowerShell commands for screenshot and process injection, use of reverse decompression of binary payloads, injection of malicious JavaScript into Discord files, dynamic process injection, extensive use of system manipulation commands, bypassing UAC via registry modification, and disabling Windows Defender. The code contains hardcoded base64 strings and encrypted payloads, suspiciously complex logic for malware persistence, and automated self-deletion or concealment mechanisms. The overall structure indicates intentional concealment and malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a highly sophisticated malware designed for data theft and persistence. It starts with base64-encoded payloads and malicious code injections into Discord. It includes functions to exfiltrate browser credentials, cookies, history, autofills, and system information. It also attempts to inject JavaScript into Discord desktop applications, possibly to hijack or monitor communications. The malware attempts UAC bypass, disables Defender, and can hide or delete itself to evade detection. It creates archives with password protection, uploads stolen data to external services, and communicates with a C2 server, potentially using webhook or API calls. The extensive use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and system manipulation clearly indicates malicious behavior. The code's complexity, encoded payloads, and injection methods all point to an advanced backdoor and information-stealing malware.",
  "conclusion": "The script demonstrates clear malicious intent, incorporating multiple techniques for data exfiltration, process injection, privilege escalation, persistence, and evasion. It operates as a full-featured infostealer and backdoor, capable of targeting browser data, system info, sessions, and user files, then exfiltrating or manipulating system components. The obfuscation, malicious injections, and self-protection mechanisms further confirm its harmful purpose.",
