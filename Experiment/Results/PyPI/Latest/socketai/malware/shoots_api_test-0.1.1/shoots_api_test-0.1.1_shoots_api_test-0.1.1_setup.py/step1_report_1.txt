{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'shoots-api-test', including metadata and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the setup() function parameters, including package metadata and entry_points.",
  "sinks": "The code executes package setup and installs an entry point script; no untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "The setup parameters define package metadata, then the entry point specifies a command-line script linked to 'shoots_api_test' function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The entry point name matches package name, which is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to configure package installation with metadata such as name, version, author, and description. It dynamically finds packages with find_packages() and sets up a console script entry point. No user input handling, external data sources, or malicious constructs are present. The setup process is straightforward and aligns with standard Python packaging practices. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package without any malicious intent or security issues. It functions to configure package installation and define an executable script. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
