  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns such as URL obfuscation and insecure SSL, which are common in malicious or covert communication scripts. However, it does not execute malicious payloads or system modifications directly. The scores assigned are appropriate, indicating moderate suspicion. Further investigation of the actual URL destinations and response content is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
