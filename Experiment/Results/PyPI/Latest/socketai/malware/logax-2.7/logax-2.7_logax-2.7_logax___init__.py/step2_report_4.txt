  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, correctness of scoring, and consistency with the code.\n\n**Overall Code Context:**\n- The code is a single line: `from .info import *`\n- It performs a relative import from a local module named 'info'.\n- There are no visible data flows, network activity, or execution beyond the import.\n- Use of `import *` is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Benign import, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, straightforward import with no issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar benign import, noting namespace pollution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity, only a note on bad practice.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Import could load malicious code if 'info' is compromised, but the import line itself is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk is slightly elevated due to potential trust issues with the 'info' module, but the import line itself isn't malicious. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk score of 0.2 seems reasonable given the dependency on external module integrity.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, no signs of malicious behavior, only a concern about 'import *'.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The import itself isn't malicious, but the overall security depends on 'info'.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same as above, with a note on bad practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. Slightly lower securityRisk score, which is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final Cross-Checks:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, since the code is straightforward.\n- **SecurityRisk scores:** Slight variations, but generally low, reflecting the potential risk if the 'info' module is compromised.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippets.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** Given the dependency on external module integrity, a small risk score (~0.2) is justified, but the current scores are reasonable.\n\n**Summary:** The import statement is benign on its own, with minimal security risk unless the 'info' module is compromised. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The security of this code hinges on the trustworthiness of the 'info' module, which cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.",
