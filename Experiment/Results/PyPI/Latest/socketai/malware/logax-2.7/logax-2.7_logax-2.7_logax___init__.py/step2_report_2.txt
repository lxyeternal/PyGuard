  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import all from local 'info'\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that this is a benign import with no malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Also correctly states that this is a simple relative import, with no malicious behavior evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.7\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The note about namespace pollution is valid but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same import, potential security concern if 'info' is compromised.\n- **Analysis:** Emphasizes that the import itself is benign but depends on 'info's integrity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk due to dependency on external module integrity. The score seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to prior reports, with focus on the import's benign nature but acknowledging dependency on 'info'.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis:** Notes that 'import *' can be bad practice but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.6\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly lower securityRisk score, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Observations:\n- **Code presence:** The import statement is straightforward and does not execute any code directly.\n- **Malware:** No evidence of malicious activity. The import itself is benign.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** The only potential concern is reliance on the 'info' module, which could be compromised. But the import statement alone is not malicious.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0** across all reports.\n- The **obfuscated score** is correctly at **0**.\n- The **securityRisk** scores are appropriately low, reflecting the dependency on external module integrity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The **confidence** scores are reasonable.\n- The **scores** for malware and obfuscated are correct.\n- The **securityRisk** scores could be slightly increased in some reports (e.g., from 0.2 to 0.3) if we consider supply chain risks more seriously, but given only this line, they are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to account for dependency on 'info', but the import line itself is benign)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary based solely on this import statement.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the contents of the 'info' module for comprehensive security assessment, as this import's safety depends on it.",
