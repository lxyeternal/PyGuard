{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'info'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the contents of the 'info' module located in the same package or directory.",
  "sinks": "The import could potentially load untrusted or malicious code if the 'info' module is compromised, but the import statement itself does not execute code beyond loading definitions.",
  "flows": "The import allows other parts of the program to access code and data from 'info', which could be used downstream in the application.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .info import *' can obscure which variables or functions are imported, but this is not inherently malicious. No other unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This single line performs a relative import from a local module 'info'. It does not include execution of code or data transfer. Since it only imports all definitions from 'info', unless the 'info' module contains malicious code, this line itself is benign. However, the security of the overall package depends on the integrity of the 'info' module. No other code is present to analyze. The import statement alone does not introduce malicious behavior but could be used to load malicious code if the 'info' module is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of an import statement which by itself is not malicious. Its security implications depend on the contents of the 'info' module, which are not provided. There are no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected in this line.",
