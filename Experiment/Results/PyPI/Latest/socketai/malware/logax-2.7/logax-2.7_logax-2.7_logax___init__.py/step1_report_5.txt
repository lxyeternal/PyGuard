{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a module named 'info' in the same package, likely for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which loads code from the 'info' module.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include any subsequent use of imported symbols; however, none are shown here.",
  "flows": "No execution flow or data flow is demonstrated beyond the import statement itself.",
  "anomalies": "The import uses a wildcard '*', which can obscure what is being imported and may be considered a bad practice. No malicious behavior can be inferred solely from this line.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement that pulls all symbols from the 'info' module in the current package. Since no further code is provided, there are no signs of malicious behavior or unusual code structures. The use of 'from .info import *' might be discouraged for clarity but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward import operation with no evident malicious intent or security risks. Due to minimal context, no malicious activity can be inferred from this single line.",
