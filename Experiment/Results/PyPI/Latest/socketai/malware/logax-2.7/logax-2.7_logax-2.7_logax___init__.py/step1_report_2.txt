{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module 'info' within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module 'info'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible in this single line; it only imports code from a local module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .info import *' can be considered bad practice due to namespace pollution, but it is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports all symbols from a sibling module named 'info'. There are no other operations, no input reading, no data transmission, or manipulation evident. The use of a relative import suggests it is part of a larger package. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detectable in this single line. Since it is a straightforward import, it does not pose an immediate security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple relative import from the 'info' module. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks based solely on this line. However, without seeing the content of 'info', a full security assessment cannot be made.",
