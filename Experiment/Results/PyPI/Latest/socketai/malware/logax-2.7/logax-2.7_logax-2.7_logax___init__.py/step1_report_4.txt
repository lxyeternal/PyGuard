{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module named 'info', likely to use its functions, classes, or variables within this module.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement 'from .info import *', which reads data or code from a local module file 'info'.",
  "sinks": "The import statement itself does not execute untrusted data or produce outputs; it only loads code or data from a local module.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows within this snippet, as it only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'import *' is generally discouraged as it can conceal which specific elements are used, but it is not inherently malicious. No other anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple import statement using relative import syntax. It loads all symbols from the 'info' module. There are no visible signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data manipulation, or hidden backdoors. Without additional context or code execution, this snippet alone is benign. The only concern could be if 'info' contains malicious code, but that cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward import operation with no evident malicious intent. It does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior on its own.",
