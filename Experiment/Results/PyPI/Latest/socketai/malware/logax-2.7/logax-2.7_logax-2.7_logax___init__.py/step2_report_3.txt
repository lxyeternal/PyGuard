  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .info import *`.\n- The core concern revolves around whether this import could introduce malicious behavior or security risks.\n- The import is a relative import from a local module named 'info'.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues in the code:\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import statement; it does not execute code, handle data, or perform network operations.\n- **Malicious behavior:** The import itself is benign; however, the security implications depend entirely on the contents of the 'info' module, which is not provided.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities can be confirmed solely from this line.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report's logic:\n- The reports correctly identify that the import is benign on its own.\n- They acknowledge that the security risk hinges on the 'info' module's content.\n- They note that using `import *` is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- No significant logical flaws are evident; the assessments are consistent with the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Review of scores assigned:\n- **Confidence scores:** Range from 0.6 to 1, which seems reasonable given the limited context.\n- **Obfuscated:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Malware:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the import's benign nature but potential dependency on the 'info' module, these seem acceptable.\n- **Recommendation:** No adjustments needed; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- Since the import line itself is benign, a higher score would be unjustified unless additional context indicates malicious content.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- No evidence of malicious activity in the import statement.\n- The potential for malicious behavior depends on the 'info' module's content, which is unknown.\n- **Therefore:** Malware score should remain at 0 unless further code indicates malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities beyond the import's potential to load malicious code if 'info' is compromised.\n- This is a reasonable assumption; no unwarranted claims are present.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n- No discrepancies detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the provided reports and analysis, the import statement is benign on its own.** The security implications depend entirely on the 'info' module's integrity, which cannot be assessed here.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (the code is straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal risk, mainly if 'info' is compromised)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a simple relative import.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on external factors (the 'info' module's trustworthiness).\n\n**Final recommendation:** The import statement is benign; no further action needed unless the 'info' module is found to be malicious.",
