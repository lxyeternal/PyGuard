{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local 'info' module, potentially exposing namespace pollution but not inherently malicious.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the import does not process untrusted data or perform actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the import loads symbols into the namespace without executing code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward relative import from a local module 'info'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities in this line. The security implications depend entirely on the contents of 'info', which are outside the scope of this snippet. The import itself is benign, and the scores should reflect that. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is minimal, around 0.1 to 0.2, considering dependency trust. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is safe and benign. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The security risk is low and primarily depends on the trustworthiness of the 'info' module, which cannot be evaluated here.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
