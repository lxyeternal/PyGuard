  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'logax' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; uses package metadata fields; dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or runtime code execution; dependencies are standard.",
  "flows": "No dynamic or runtime data flows; static setup data used for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder URL; empty author fields; no actual malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or embedded secrets. The placeholder URL and missing author info are typical in initial templates but do not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk scores (~0.1-0.2). The inclusion of 'requests' as a dependency is common and not suspicious. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk scores are appropriate, reflecting minor metadata incompleteness but no security issues. The code poses no threat and can be considered safe.",
