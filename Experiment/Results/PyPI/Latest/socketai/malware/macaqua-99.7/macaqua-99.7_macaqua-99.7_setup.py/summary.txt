  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is a significant security concern, as it allows arbitrary code execution. While the code itself is not malicious, this pattern can be exploited if 'main.py' contains malicious code. The high scores in the reports are justified by this risk pattern. Further review of 'main.py' is recommended before distribution."
