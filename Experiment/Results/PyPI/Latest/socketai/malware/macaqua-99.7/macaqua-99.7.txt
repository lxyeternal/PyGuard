      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is a significant security concern, as it allows arbitrary code execution. While the code itself is not malicious, this pattern can be exploited if 'main.py' contains malicious code. The high scores in the reports are justified by this risk pattern. Further review of 'main.py' is recommended before distribution."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, posing significant privacy and security risks. While it does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation, its behavior warrants high suspicion. The malware score should be adjusted to around 0.7, and the security risk to approximately 0.75, reflecting the potential for malicious activity and privacy invasion."
