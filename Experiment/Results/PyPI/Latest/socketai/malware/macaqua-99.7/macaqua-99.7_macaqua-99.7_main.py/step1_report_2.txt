  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple external URLs, possibly for tracking or data collection.",

  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, current_path) -> URL encoding -> network request to external URLs",
  "anomalies": "Sending system info to suspicious external domains, use of random number in URL, no clear legitimate purpose, lack of user consent indication",
  "analysis": "The code collects system hostname, username, and current directory, then constructs URLs with these parameters along with a random number. It sends HTTP GET requests to three suspicious external domains. The use of random numbers and external domains suggests potential tracking or data exfiltration. No data is processed or stored locally beyond variables, and there is no indication of legitimate functionality. The code operates silently, which could be malicious if used without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be designed for tracking or data collection purposes, sending system information to external domains without clear user consent. The suspicious domains and silent data transmission are concerning, indicating potential malicious behavior.",
