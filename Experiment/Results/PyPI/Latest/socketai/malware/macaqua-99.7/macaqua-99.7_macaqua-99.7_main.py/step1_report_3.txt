  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to multiple external URLs, possibly for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to external URLs",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory) -> URL with parameters -> HTTP request to external server",
  "anomalies": "Unusual URLs pointing to suspicious domains, sending system info without user consent, no user prompt or validation, usage of random number for URL parameter (rd_num) without clear purpose",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs URLs targeting suspicious domains. It appends these parameters along with a random number, then attempts to send HTTP GET requests to these URLs. The code operates silently and logs responses or errors. The external URLs are suspicious, possibly malicious, and the script appears designed to leak system information without user knowledge. No obvious malicious payload like code execution or data theft is evident, but the pattern of exfiltration and suspicious endpoints indicate malicious intent or at least privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting system info and transmitting it to known suspicious domains without user consent, indicating potential privacy violation or malicious intent. The overall security risk is high due to data exfiltration, although it does not execute malicious payloads directly.",
