{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'sendtowev' package and prints a success message, likely for notification or confirmation.",
  "sources": "The import statement for 'sendtowev' reads the package code; the print statement reads no external input.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the import is static, and the print is static output.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'sendtowev' could be suspicious if it is not a well-known package; no other anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a single import and a print statement. The import of 'sendtowev' might be harmless or malicious depending on the package's origin and behavior. The print statement is benign. No dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evident malicious behavior. The only point of concern is the package 'sendtowev', which should be verified for trustworthiness, but based solely on this code, there are no security issues.",
