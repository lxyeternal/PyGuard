  "purpose": "Minimal Python script importing 'sendtowev' and printing a success message.",
  "sources": "Import statement of 'sendtowev' package",
  "sinks": "None within this snippet; potential concern if 'sendtowev' executes malicious code upon import",
  "flows": "Import of 'sendtowev' (source) potentially leading to code execution if the package is malicious",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and print statement",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing an external package and printing a message. No functions or data manipulations are present. The main security concern hinges on the trustworthiness of 'sendtowev', which cannot be assessed here. The code itself shows no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2, confidence=0.4-0.8) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent. The primary security consideration is verifying the legitimacy of the 'sendtowev' package. Based solely on this snippet, the security risk is low, and the scores are consistent with the analysis.",
