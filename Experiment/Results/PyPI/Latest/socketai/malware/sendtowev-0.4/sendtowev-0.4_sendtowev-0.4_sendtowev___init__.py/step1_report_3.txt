{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious data stealer and information collector targeting user credentials, browser data, tokens, and system information for exfiltration via Discord webhooks and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Sources include environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), system files (browser storage, wallet files, cookies, history, bookmarks), network requests (IP, geolocation, Gofile uploads, Discord API), and log files from browsers and applications.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to Discord webhooks, uploaded to file hosting services (gofile.io), and potentially used for further processing within the script (e.g., printing or storing in variables).",
  "flows": "Malicious data flows from reading user/system/browser data (sources), including tokens, passwords, cookies, history, and wallet info, then exfiltrates through webhooks or uploads, with some flows involving token validation, decryption, and token-based API calls for extracting more info.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or misleading function names (e.g., G37D15C0rD, UP104D70K3N), excessive use of threading for concurrent data collection, suspicious URL patterns, code for token extraction from logs, and the inclusion of potentially dangerous system commands (taskkill). Hardcoded webhook URL and external URLs for data fetching are also suspicious. Many functions perform hidden or stealthy actions, e.g., killing processes, copying files, and collecting tokens silently.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically searches user directories, browser profiles, and application data for sensitive information such as passwords, cookies, credit card info, autofill data, browsing history, bookmarks, and wallet info. It decrypts encrypted tokens and passwords, collects system info like IP and geolocation, and verifies tokens via API requests. It uploads collected data to external servers and sends detailed reports via Discord webhooks. Multiple functions involve threading for parallel data collection, and there are deliberate attempts at obfuscation and stealth, such as disabling console output, killing processes, and hiding system activity. The script also includes functions to validate tokens and fetch additional user info, indicating intent to harvest user accounts and credentials stealthily.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, primarily functioning as a comprehensive info stealer targeting browser data, tokens, wallet info, and system details. It exfiltrates data covertly to external servers and Discord webhooks, with extensive use of threading, decryption, and obfuscation techniques. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malware with a high security risk score.",
