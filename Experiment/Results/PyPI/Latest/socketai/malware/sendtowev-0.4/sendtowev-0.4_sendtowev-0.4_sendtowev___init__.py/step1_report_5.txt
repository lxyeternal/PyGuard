{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious script designed to extract sensitive information from the user's system, including Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, browser history, bookmarks, and wallet information, then exfiltrate this data via webhooks and upload files to file-sharing services.",
  "sources": "Reads system information, environment variables, browser data directories, local database files (logins, cookies, history, credit cards, autofill, bookmarks), and files from user directories such as Desktop, Downloads, Documents. Also reads tokens from log files and SQLite databases.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP requests to Discord webhooks, uploads files to external file-sharing servers (gofile.io), and exfiltrates tokens, passwords, cookies, history, bookmarks, and wallet info. Executes external processes to kill browser or wallet processes and manipulate files.",
  "flows": "System and browser data are collected from various directories, decrypted, and then stored in variables. These are then compiled into formatted messages or files, which are exfiltrated through webhooks and file uploads. Specific flows include token extraction from logs and database files, decryption of saved credentials, and uploading the collected data.",
  "anomalies": "The script performs numerous suspicious actions such as forcibly killing processes related to debuggers, reverse engineering tools, or virtual machine indicators, checking for VM presence and debuggers, installing missing modules silently, and then executing data exfiltration. It dynamically loads external scripts from URLs and attempts to connect to known malicious or suspicious URLs. It also includes code that could be used for credential theft, wallet theft, or system sabotage. The code employs obfuscation tactics like dynamic imports, environment checks, and base64 decoding.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by suppressing warnings and ensuring required modules are installed, notably cryptography libraries. It then runs anti-debugging checks by scanning for known debugging or reverse engineering tools and VM indicators. It also checks for blacklisted IPs and VM environment artifacts. The script retrieves external configuration data from URLs. It performs token extraction from browser logs and databases, decrypts stored credentials and cookies using Windows Data Protection API, and collects various browser, wallet, and application data. All data is formatted and sent via webhooks, and files are uploaded to external servers. There are multiple threads for concurrent data collection. The script uses process termination commands to kill browsers or other targeted processes before extracting data, which is suspicious. Overall, the code is clearly designed for stealthy data theft, exfiltration, and system sabotage, with techniques to evade detection and analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits strong malicious intent with comprehensive data harvesting, system sabotage tactics, and external communication for exfiltration. It targets user credentials, tokens, wallet data, and browser histories, while attempting to hide its activity through anti-debugging and environment checks. It is highly dangerous and should be classified as malware with a security risk score near maximum. The overall confidence in this assessment is very high, given the behaviors and techniques observed.",
