{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a credential, token, and data stealer targeting Windows systems. It extracts sensitive information such as browser passwords, cookies, history, bookmarks, wallet data, and system info, decrypts stored credentials, and exfiltrates this data via webhooks and file uploads. It employs anti-debugging, VM detection, process termination, threading, and obfuscation to evade analysis and maximize stealth.",
  "sources": "Browser profile files (SQLite DBs, local storage), wallet files, logs, environment variables, remote URLs for configuration, local system files, and database files.",
  "sinks": "External webhooks (Discord, GoFile), file uploads, process termination routines, remote configuration fetches, and data exfiltration channels.",
  "flows": "Local data collection from browsers, wallets, logs → decryption of credentials → data aggregation → exfiltration via webhooks or file uploads → process termination and environment checks for anti-analysis.",
  "anomalies": "Use of threading for concurrent operations, dynamic dependency installation, suppression of warnings, obfuscated variable names, remote URL fetching for configuration, process killing routines targeting debuggers/VMs, and extensive stealth techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple malicious activities: extracting stored credentials (passwords, tokens, cookies), decrypting them using Windows APIs and AES-GCM, reading from various browser profiles and wallet files, and collecting system info. It employs anti-debugging measures such as VM detection, process termination, and environment checks. It dynamically fetches configuration URLs and exfiltrates data via webhooks and file uploads. The use of threading and suppression of warnings indicates stealth intent. The code's structure and behaviors align with known credential and data-stealing malware, with extensive exfiltration channels and evasion tactics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious credential and data stealer malware. It employs anti-analysis techniques, decrypts stored sensitive data, and exfiltrates this information stealthily via webhooks and file uploads. The behaviors are consistent with advanced malware designed for system compromise, data theft, and account hijacking. The overall assessment confirms its malicious intent with maximum severity.",
