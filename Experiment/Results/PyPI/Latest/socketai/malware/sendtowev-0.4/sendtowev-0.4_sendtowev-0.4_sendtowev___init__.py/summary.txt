  "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious credential and data stealer malware. It employs anti-analysis techniques, decrypts stored sensitive data, and exfiltrates this information stealthily via webhooks and file uploads. The behaviors are consistent with advanced malware designed for system compromise, data theft, and account hijacking. The overall assessment confirms its malicious intent with maximum severity."
