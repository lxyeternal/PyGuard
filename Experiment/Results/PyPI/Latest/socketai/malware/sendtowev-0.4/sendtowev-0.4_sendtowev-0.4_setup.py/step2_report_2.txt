  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of reports:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools.\n- The only anomaly noted across all reports is the trailing whitespace in the `version` string ('0.4    ').\n- No reports identify any malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), indicating strong agreement.\n- Malware scores are all 0, with no suspicion of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The version string contains trailing whitespace ('0.4    '). This is a formatting issue but not a security concern.\n- No evidence of code injection, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious constructs.\n- The code is purely declarative, setting package metadata and dependencies.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the script.\n- The minor formatting irregularity (whitespace) is consistently noted but not deemed harmful.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are very low, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting consensus.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are detected, scores of 0 or very close to 0 are justified.\n- The only minor concern is the whitespace, which does not justify increasing the risk score.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, straightforward setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The minor formatting irregularity (whitespace) is cosmetic and does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score / Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated         | **0** — Code is clear, straightforward, and standard.               |\n| Security Risk      | **0** — No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors present.             |\n\n**Note:** The very slight anomalies (whitespace) do not warrant higher scores. They are typical minor formatting issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, standard packaging configuration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The minor whitespace issue should be cleaned but does not affect security. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low or zero security risk score.",
