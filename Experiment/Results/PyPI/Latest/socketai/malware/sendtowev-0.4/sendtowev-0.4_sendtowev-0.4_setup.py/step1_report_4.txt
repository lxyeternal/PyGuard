  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the Python project 'sendtowev'.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata (name, version, description, author info), reading dependencies ('requests'), and package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or data sinks present in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A – the setup script primarily specifies static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The version string contains trailing spaces ('0.4    '), which is unusual but not malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools functions to specify package metadata and dependencies. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The version string's trailing spaces are atypical but benign. No dynamic code execution, environment variable use, or network activity is present. The code is straightforward and typical of Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the trailing spaces in the version string, which do not affect security.",
