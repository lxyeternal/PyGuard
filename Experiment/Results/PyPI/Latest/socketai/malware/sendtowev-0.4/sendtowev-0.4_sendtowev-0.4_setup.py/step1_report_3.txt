  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'sendtowev'.",
  "sources": "N/A (setup script does not read external input or data).",
  "sinks": "N/A (setup script does not contain code that executes untrusted data).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of inconsistent whitespace in the 'version' field ('0.4    '). No other anomalies or suspicious code features detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, importing 'setuptools' and defining package metadata including name, version, description, author details, packages to include, dependencies, and classifiers. The version string contains unnecessary trailing spaces, which is a minor formatting issue but not malicious. No input reading, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and typical for package distribution, with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable issue is the whitespace in the version string, which is harmless but should be cleaned for best practice.",
