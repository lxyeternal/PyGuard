  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'sendtowev'.",
  "sources": "Reading package requirements ('requests'), package discovery ('find_packages()'), and package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data directly influences execution or data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A; standard setup process without dynamic data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an extra space in the 'version' string ('0.4    '), but no malicious code or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package configuration. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. The 'install_requires' only specifies a common dependency ('requests'). The version string has an unusual trailing whitespace, which is likely a typographical issue, not malicious. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, no network connections, or other suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward package configuration file.",
