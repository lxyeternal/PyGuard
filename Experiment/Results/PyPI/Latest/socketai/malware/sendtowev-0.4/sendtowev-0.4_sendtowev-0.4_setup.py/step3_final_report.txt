  "anomalies": "Trailing whitespace in the version string '0.4    ' is the only irregularity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The only anomaly is the trailing whitespace in the version string, which is a minor formatting issue. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the script and assign malware scores of 0, with very low security risk scores (around 0.1), justified by the trivial formatting irregularity. The code's simplicity and lack of obfuscation are confirmed by the high confidence scores. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor whitespace in the version string is cosmetic and does not impact security. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation score at 0, and the security risk score at 0.1 to reflect the minor formatting irregularity. No further action is necessary.",
