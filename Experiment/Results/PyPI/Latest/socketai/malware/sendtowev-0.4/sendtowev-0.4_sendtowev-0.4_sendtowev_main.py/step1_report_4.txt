  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task, but since no code was provided, the exact purpose cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "No sources identified due to absence of code; typically would include input functions, environment variables, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; sinks would normally be places where data could be leaked or malicious actions performed, such as network requests, file writes, or eval calls.",
  "flows": "No data flows can be traced without code; generally, source-to-sink paths involve untrusted input leading to dangerous functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected due to lack of code; normally look for hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information; no code provided to analyze for security issues, malware, or anomalies. Cannot determine any source, sink, or flow patterns.",
  "conclusion": "No code provided for review. Unable to identify malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. Further code needed for meaningful analysis.",
