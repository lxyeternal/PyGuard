  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments and scores.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation for interacting with Google Sheets, supporting both public and service account authentication. No malicious or suspicious behavior is observed.\n\n**Details:**  \n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.  \n- No obfuscation or malicious code patterns.  \n- Uses standard libraries and patterns.  \n- Cache decorators are typical for performance.  \n- No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious intent evident.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, considering external API interactions)\n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe report's reasoning is sound. The code appears benign and secure. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**  \nSimilar to Report 1, with emphasis on the use of duckdb for SQL queries on spreadsheet data. No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Details:**  \n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.  \n- SQL execution on user input is standard but could be risky if inputs are untrusted, yet this is typical for query functions.  \n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns.  \n- Uses standard API calls and libraries.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low)\n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The code is legitimate, with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**  \nAgain, the code is a standard Google Sheets API wrapper supporting public and service account access. No malicious activity.\n\n**Details:**  \n- No secrets or secrets leaks.  \n- URL validation and parsing are standard.  \n- SQL queries are executed on in-memory duckdb, which is common.  \n- No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low)\n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe analysis is correct; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard implementation for Google Sheets interaction, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Details:**  \n- Uses standard libraries and APIs.  \n- URL validation, parsing, and data handling are typical.  \n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.  \n- SQL queries are sanitized via parser, preventing injection.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code's behavior; it is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**  \nAgain, a standard, legitimate library for Google Sheets interaction with no malicious indicators.\n\n**Details:**  \n- No suspicious code constructs.  \n- Uses regex, URL validation, and gspread libraries legitimately.  \n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.  \n- Data flows are typical.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe assessment is accurate; the code appears secure and benign.\n\n---\n\n## Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (standard API interaction, no secrets hardcoded, no suspicious data flows)\n\n---\n\n## Final notes:\n- The use of duckdb for SQL queries on spreadsheet data is standard and not inherently malicious.\n- Cache decorators are common for performance.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The code is a well-structured, open-source-like implementation for spreadsheet interaction.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign, with no security risks or malware. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.",
