  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides classes for interacting with Google Sheets, including reading, querying, creating, updating, and clearing sheets. It uses standard libraries and patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** The code is well-structured, uses cache decorators appropriately, and relies on open-source libraries like gspread, pandas, duckdb. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risks are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, as it's a standard data handling library with minimal risk).\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on Google Sheets interaction with standard patterns. Mentions use of duckdb for SQL queries, which is typical.\n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code. The use of duckdb for SQL queries on spreadsheet data is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same general purpose—interacting with Google Sheets, both public and service account. Uses pandas, gspread, duckdb, with URL validation and caching.\n- **Analysis:** No hidden or malicious code. Credential handling is standard. SQL queries are executed on trusted data sources. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate code, no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (even lower, reflecting confidence in benign behavior).\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard Google Sheets API wrapper with proper use of libraries and safe data handling.\n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. SQL execution is on trusted data, and dependencies are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard library for Google Sheets interaction, with no suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Uses regex for URL parsing, which is normal. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns. External dependencies are legitimate.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, consistent with the code analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports assign 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero but very low, reflecting minimal security concerns based on the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores given are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, standard data access and manipulation code)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured library for interacting with Google Sheets, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate.",
