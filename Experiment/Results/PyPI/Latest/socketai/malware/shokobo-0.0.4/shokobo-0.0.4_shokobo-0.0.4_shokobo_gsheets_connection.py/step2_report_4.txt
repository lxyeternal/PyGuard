  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the logical consistency of the findings, the appropriateness of the scores, and whether any suspicious or malicious behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard implementation for interacting with Google Sheets, supporting both service account and public URLs, with functions for reading, querying, creating, updating, and clearing sheets. No suspicious or malicious code is identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report's conclusion aligns with the code's structure. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are present.\n- The security risk score (0.2) seems slightly conservative but acceptable given the external API interactions.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malware or backdoors are evident.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed analysis of the code's structure. Highlights the use of duckdb for SQL querying and standard API calls. No malicious intent or suspicious code is found.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is consistent. The use of duckdb for executing SQL on spreadsheet data is standard, not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- The security risk score remains conservative, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a legitimate wrapper for Google Sheets, with no evidence of malicious activity. Uses standard libraries and practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is solid. The lower security risk score (0.1) reflects the absence of suspicious behavior.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n- The obfuscated score remains correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard implementation with proper handling of URL validation, spreadsheet operations, and safe data processing. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis is consistent and well-reasoned.\n- The security risk score is appropriately low.\n- No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate library for interacting with Google Spreadsheets, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The conclusion aligns with the code's apparent functionality.\n- The security risk score is reasonable.\n- No malware or obfuscation issues.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, well-structured API wrapper for Google Sheets.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is found.\n- The security risk scores are conservative but acceptable, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n### **My Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, as the code interacts with external APIs but is standard in nature)\n\n**Final justification:** The code is a typical, legitimate implementation of Google Sheets API interaction, with no suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscation. The use of cache decorators, URL validation, and standard libraries further supports its benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
