  "purpose": "Provides classes and methods for interacting with Google Sheets, supporting both public and service account authentication, including reading, querying, creating, updating, and clearing sheets.",
  "sources": "External API calls to gspread, pandas CSV download, URL parsing, user-provided data inputs, cache decorators for data retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Data returned as pandas DataFrame, data written to Google Sheets via gspread, SQL query results via duckdb, cache storage.",
  "flows": "Input data from URL or user parameters -> validation and parsing -> API interactions (read/write) -> cache storage -> DataFrame output or data modification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, URL validation is standard, no malicious data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured API wrapper for Google Sheets, supporting both public and service account modes. It uses standard libraries like gspread, pandas, duckdb, and regex for URL parsing. No secrets are hardcoded; URL validation and data handling are typical. SQL queries are executed on trusted data sources with no signs of malicious behavior. Cache decorators are used appropriately for performance. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are detected. The overall design aligns with legitimate data access and manipulation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation for interacting with Google Sheets, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
