  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the classes and their data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies data outputs and flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code is standard, uses typical libraries, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, legitimate implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (low risk).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable given the functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; details the classes and data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Appropriately described; includes cache and API interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns; use of duckdb SQL is standard.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; SQL execution is on trusted inputs.\n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malware or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. The security risk is low, and the malware score is correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes data flow and sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; data from URLs, secrets, parameters.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no secrets hardcoded, no malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Standard API usage, URL validation, and pandas operations.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. The low security risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; detailed description.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly identified.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Uses standard libraries, safe SQL, URL parsing.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard URL parsing.\n- **Analysis:** Uses common libraries and patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate and aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code does not exhibit any malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low security risk, which is appropriate given the functionality.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated:** **0**  \n**Risk:** **0.1 - 0.2** (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.  \n- The use of standard libraries (gspread, pandas, duckdb) and URL validation indicates legitimate operations.  \n- SQL execution is on controlled inputs, and no secrets are hardcoded.  \n- Cache decorators are common performance optimizations.  \n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears secure, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified by the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent, and their scoring aligns well with the code's content. No adjustments are necessary.",
