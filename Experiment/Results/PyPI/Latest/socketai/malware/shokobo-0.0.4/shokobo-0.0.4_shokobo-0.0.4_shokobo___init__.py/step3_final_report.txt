{
  "purpose": "This code imports the GSheetsConnection class from the streamlit_gsheets package, likely to establish a connection to Google Sheets within a Streamlit application.",
  "sources": "The import statement from streamlit_gsheets.gsheets_connection, which may read the package code or dependencies during execution.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "The import loads the class GSheetsConnection into the namespace; no data flow or execution beyond import occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single import statement. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The import is from a third-party package, which is common in open-source projects. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The import statement itself does not pose security risks or malicious behavior. The code is benign and standard for establishing external dependencies in a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement with licensing comments. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The import from streamlit_gsheets is typical for projects integrating Google Sheets with Streamlit. The overall security assessment is that this code is safe and poses no threat.",
