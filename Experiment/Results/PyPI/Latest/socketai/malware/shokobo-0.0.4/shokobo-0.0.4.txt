      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious external network call during package setup, indicative of potential malicious activity or tracking. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a malware score of 0.75 and a security risk score of 0.75 accurately reflect the risk. The behavior warrants further validation of the URL's purpose before trusting or deploying this package."

The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate."
