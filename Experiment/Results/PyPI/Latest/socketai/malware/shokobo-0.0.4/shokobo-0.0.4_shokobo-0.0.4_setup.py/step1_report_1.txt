  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'shokobo' including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "subprocess.run() call executing 'curl' command to send an HTTP request to an external URL.",
  "sinks": "External URL accessed via subprocess; potential data exfiltration or malicious external communication.",
  "flows": " subprocess.run() (source) -> External URL (sink), with no other input or data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to invoke 'curl' to access an external URL during setup, which is unusual and suspicious for a package setup script. No other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package setup and executes a subprocess to run 'curl' targeting a webhook URL. This invocation occurs during the module import, likely when the setup script runs. The URL appears to be a webhook, possibly used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration. The rest of the script follows standard package setup practices with dependencies and metadata. The subprocess call does not handle errors or output, which could conceal malicious activity. Overall, the primary concern is the external HTTP request made during setup, which may be used to track installations or perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes an unusual subprocess call that contacts an external webhook URL during setup, which could be malicious or at least suspicious. This behavior could be used for tracking, data exfiltration, or other malicious purposes. Aside from this, the rest of the code appears to be standard package setup code.",
