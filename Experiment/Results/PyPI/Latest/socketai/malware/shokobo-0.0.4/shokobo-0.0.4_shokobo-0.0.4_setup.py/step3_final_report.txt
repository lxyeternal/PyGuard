  "purpose": "Detect and evaluate potential malicious behavior or security risks in the Python package setup code, focusing on external network activity and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.run(['curl', 'https://webhook.site/...']) call executed at module import time during setup.",
  "sinks": "External URL accessed via subprocess, potentially leading to data exfiltration, tracking, or malicious command-and-control communication.",
  "flows": "Code execution flows from module import to subprocess call, which contacts an external webhook URL without validation or error handling.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional external network request during package setup, no error handling, contact with a known testing webhook URL, executed at import time.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures but includes a suspicious subprocess call to 'curl' targeting an external webhook URL during import, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The call occurs unconditionally, with no error handling, increasing risk. The URL is a known testing endpoint, suggesting tracking or exfiltration potential. The code otherwise appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The suspicious external call during setup justifies high malware and security risk scores. The behavior aligns with malicious or tracking activities, warranting caution and further investigation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious external network call during package setup, indicative of potential malicious activity or tracking. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a malware score of 0.75 and a security risk score of 0.75 accurately reflect the risk. The behavior warrants further validation of the URL's purpose before trusting or deploying this package.",
