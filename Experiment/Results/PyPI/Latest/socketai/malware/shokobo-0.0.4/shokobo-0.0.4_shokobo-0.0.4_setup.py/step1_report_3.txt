  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'shokobo' with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from hardcoded strings and external URLs; subprocess run executes an external command.",
  "sinks": "Potential network interaction via subprocess; no other explicit sinks.",
  "flows": "Subprocess run initiates a network request to an external URL immediately upon import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run with curl to access an external URL during module import; no validation or control over this action. No other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures using setuptools, which is common and benign. However, it immediately executes 'subprocess.run' with 'curl' to send a request to an external webhook URL during module import, which is unusual and potentially malicious, as it could be used to exfiltrate data or confirm the presence of the module. This behavior is suspicious because such network activity during import can be used for tracking or malicious command and control communication. No other malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. The rest of the code is standard setup code for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the immediate network request via subprocess during module import, which could be malicious or at least undesirable. This behavior indicates a potential security risk or malicious intent, especially if the URL is malicious or used for tracking. The package setup code itself is normal, but the subprocess call raises suspicion.",
