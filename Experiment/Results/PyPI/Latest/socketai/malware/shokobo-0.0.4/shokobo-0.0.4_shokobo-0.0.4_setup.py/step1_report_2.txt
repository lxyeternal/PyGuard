{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'shokobo' with specified dependencies and metadata, including an initial command to send an HTTP request.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.run call that executes 'curl' to send data to a webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run command can send network data to an external server, potentially leaking information or executing malicious commands.",
  "flows": "The code executes 'curl' via subprocess before package setup, which sends data to an external webhook, potentially leaking environment info or executing malicious data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The subprocess.run call immediately makes an external HTTP request during module import, which is unusual and suspicious for a package setup script; no other suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup using setuptools, which is standard. However, it includes a subprocess.run invocation with 'curl' targeting a webhook URL at the start of the script. This command executes during module import, sending a network request to an external server. Such behavior can be used for tracking, malicious exfiltration, or command-and-control communication. No other malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation is present. The rest of the script appears typical for a setup script, with dependencies and metadata configuration. The external call is highly suspicious, as it executes unconditionally upon import and could be exploited for malicious purposes or user tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a potentially malicious behavior due to an external network call at import time, which could be used for data exfiltration or tracking without user consent. While the package setup code itself appears standard, the early network request raises security concerns.",
