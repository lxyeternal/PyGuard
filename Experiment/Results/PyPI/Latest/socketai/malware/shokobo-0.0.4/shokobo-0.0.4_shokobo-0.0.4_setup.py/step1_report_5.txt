{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'shokobo', including installation requirements and package metadata.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.run command executing 'curl' to send an HTTP request.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run command potentially sends data over the network to an external URL.",
  "flows": "The code executes 'curl' via subprocess, which could transmit data or trigger external network activity.",
  "anomalies": "The use of subprocess to execute 'curl' directly in a setup script is unusual and suspicious, as setup scripts typically do not perform network calls. The URL targets a webhook, potentially for exfiltration or malicious signaling. No other suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and subprocess, then immediately runs a subprocess to execute 'curl' targeting an external webhook URL. This network call occurs at setup time, which is unusual and potentially malicious, as setup scripts should not perform external communications. The rest of the code is standard for package setup: defining version, name, dependencies, and metadata. The external 'curl' call could be used for malicious purposes such as signaling, exfiltration, or monitoring of the environment where the package is installed. No other malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident in the package metadata or dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The presence of an unsolicited network request via 'curl' in the setup script is suspicious and potentially malicious, possibly used for malicious signaling or data exfiltration. This behavior should be further investigated before use.",
