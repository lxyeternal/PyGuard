  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It does not contain active malware or destructive payloads but poses significant privacy and security risks. The behavior warrants high malware and security risk scores, justified by the privacy invasion and data exfiltration. The code is clear and not obfuscated. Overall, the package should be flagged for privacy concerns and further investigation."
