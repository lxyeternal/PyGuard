{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information during installation and exfiltrates it via a hardcoded Slack webhook, indicating covert data collection.",
  "sources": "Commands executed via os.popen() and os.system() to gather OS info, network info, user info, hostname, and process list.",
  "sinks": "The curl command executed through os.system() that sends collected data to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System commands (sources) gather data, which is then formatted into JSON and transmitted via curl (sink) during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded webhook URL, collection of extensive system info without user consent, and transmission during package install without notification.",
  "analysis": "The code hooks into the setuptools install process, executing platform-specific commands to gather sensitive system data. It constructs a JSON payload and exfiltrates it via a curl command to a hardcoded Slack webhook. No destructive or privilege-escalating actions are present; behavior is limited to data collection and transmission. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The exfiltration during install indicates privacy-invasive behavior, potentially malicious, but lacks active malicious payloads like backdoors or destructive commands. The use of subprocess calls and hardcoded URLs increases security and privacy concerns. The behavior aligns with covert surveillance or reconnaissance activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It does not contain active malware or destructive payloads but poses significant privacy and security risks. The behavior warrants high malware and security risk scores, justified by the privacy invasion and data exfiltration. The code is clear and not obfuscated. Overall, the package should be flagged for privacy concerns and further investigation.",
