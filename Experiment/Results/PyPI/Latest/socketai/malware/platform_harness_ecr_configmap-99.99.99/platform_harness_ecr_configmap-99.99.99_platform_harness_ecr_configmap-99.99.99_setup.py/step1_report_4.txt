{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that collects system information and posts it to a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "os.popen('uname -a'), os.popen('ifconfig'), os.popen('curl ifconfig.me'), os.popen('systeminfo'), os.popen('ipconfig'), os.popen('whoami'), os.popen('hostname')",
  "sinks": "os.system('curl -X POST ...') to send data to an external URL (Slack webhook)",
  "flows": "During installation, system info and user info are gathered via os.popen calls and then sent via os.system to the Slack webhook",
  "anomalies": "The code collects extensive system information and immediately posts it to an external webhook without user consent or security measures. The URL used for posting contains what appears to be a Slack webhook URL, which could be used maliciously for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to perform additional actions. It gathers system information based on OS, including uname, ifconfig, curl output, or systeminfo, ipconfig, tasklist. It also retrieves current directory, username, and hostname. Instead of storing or processing this data locally, it constructs a message containing all this info and posts it to a Slack webhook URL via os.system call, using a cURL command with embedded JSON data. This behavior resembles data exfiltration, collecting user/system info without consent and sending it to an external server. The URL appears to be a Slack webhook, which could be used maliciously to harvest system data. The code does not perform any malicious payload beyond data collection and exfiltration, but the behavior is suspicious and could be used maliciously if misused.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system data collection and sends it externally via a webhook during package installation. This behavior resembles information exfiltration, which could be malicious if done without user consent. The presence of a webhook URL embedded in code is suspicious. Overall, it presents a security concern due to potential data leakage.",
