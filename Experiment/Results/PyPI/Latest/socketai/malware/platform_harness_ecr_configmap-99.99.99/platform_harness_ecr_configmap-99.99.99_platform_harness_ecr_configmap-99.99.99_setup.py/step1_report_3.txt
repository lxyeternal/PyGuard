  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it to a remote Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment commands: 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist', 'whoami', 'hostname'. These are invoked via os.popen and os.system.",
  "sinks": "The untrusted data is assembled into a JSON payload and sent via an HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook URL using os.system with curl.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system commands to variables, then from variables into a JSON payload, which is sent over the network to a remote webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code gathers extensive system information, including hostname, user identity, OS details, IP addresses, and even process lists, then transmits this data externally. Hardcoded webhook URL and the use of subprocess calls for system info collection are suspicious. The use of os.system to perform network requests instead of more secure HTTP libraries is also notable.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install process, executing system commands to collect detailed system information based on the platform. It then constructs a JSON message containing this data and sends it to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL using os.system with curl. The data collected includes sensitive information such as hostname, current user, system configuration, and IP addresses. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent. The approach of using os.system for network communication and the hardcoded webhook strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially for reconnaissance or data theft. No malicious code snippets such as backdoors, privilege escalation, or destructive actions are present, but the data collection and exfiltration are highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script acts as a malicious data exfiltration tool embedded within a package's install process. It collects extensive system info and transmits it to an external server without user consent. This behavior indicates malicious intent, aimed at surveillance or reconnaissance.",
