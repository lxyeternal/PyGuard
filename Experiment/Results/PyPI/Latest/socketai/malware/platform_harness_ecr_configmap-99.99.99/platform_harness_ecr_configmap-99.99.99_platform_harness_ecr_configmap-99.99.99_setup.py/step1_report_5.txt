  "purpose": "Custom installation process that gathers system information and sends it to a specified Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls for 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'whoami', 'hostname'; os.system() call that posts data to Slack webhook.",
  "sinks": "os.popen() outputs used to gather system info; os.system() executes a curl command that posts data to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info via os.popen()) are collected and formatted into a JSON payload, which is then sent via os.system() to a remote Slack webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional collection and transmission of detailed system info during installation without user consent; use of hardcoded webhook URL; reliance on os.popen() and os.system() which are potentially insecure and outdated.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the run method to gather system information across different platforms. It collects hostname, current directory, user, OS details, and IP information. Importantly, it constructs and executes a curl command that posts this information to a Slack webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating system data at install time. The use of hardcoded webhook URL, combined with unprompted data transmission, suggests malicious or at least suspicious behavior, as it can be used for tracking, data theft, or surveillance. The code does not perform any malicious system modifications but performs covert data exfiltration during package installation, which is a security concern. No obfuscation is present, but the network activity and information harvesting are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates system information during installation by sending details to an external webhook, which could be malicious or used for tracking. It does not perform system damage but presents a significant privacy and security risk due to unauthorized data collection and transmission.",
