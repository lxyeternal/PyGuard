{
  "purpose": "This code customizes the installation process for a Python package, gathering system information and posting it to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Reading system commands and environment data via os.popen and os.system calls, including uname, ifconfig, curl, hostname, whoami, systeminfo, ipconfig, tasklist.",
  "sinks": "Posting data to an external Slack webhook URL using os.system with curl, sending potentially sensitive system information.",
  "flows": "System commands collect OS, network, and user info (sources), which is then formatted into a JSON payload and sent via curl to a remote webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of commands like 'tasklist' on Windows to gather data not directly related to typical installation tasks; posting system info during install is suspicious. The hardcoded webhook URL is potentially malicious or intended for data exfiltration. The code runs system commands based on platform detection and leaks data to an external server.",
  "analysis": "The script hooks into the installation process, collects detailed system information across platforms, and transmits this data to an external URL via a curl command embedded in os.system. It does not perform malicious actions such as modifying system files or executing destructive commands, but it secretly collects and exfiltrates sensitive environment data during package installation. The use of hardcoded URL and gathering of hostname, user, IP info indicates potential privacy violation or malicious intent, especially if used without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting comprehensive system data during package installation and exfiltrating it to an external webhook. While it does not directly execute destructive malware, this pattern is consistent with covert data collection or spyware. The malicious behavior score is high due to data exfiltration, and the security risk is significant. It appears to be intentionally designed to harvest system information surreptitiously.",
