  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script, reads environment variables, filesystem, and files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses `exec()` on `_version.py` without sanitization, which is a known pattern but can be risky if the file is compromised.\n- **Anomalies:** The main concern is the use of `exec()` without validation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; the risk is low, but the exec() pattern warrants caution.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.2 — seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with the same concern about `exec()` on `_version.py`.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also similar; uses `exec()` for version info.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- The most recent and detailed, with a confidence of 1.0.\n- No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, the code is standard for a setup script.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The use of `exec()` to load `_version.py` is a known pattern but could be risky if the file is tampered with. However, in controlled environments, this is acceptable.\n- **Scores for malware and risk:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is correct. The security risk scores are around 0.2 for the first four reports, which is reasonable given the exec() pattern. The last report correctly assigns 0.0.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The use of `exec()` on `_version.py` should be noted as a potential security concern, but it is a common pattern in setup scripts.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or malware.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk due to exec(), but acceptable in controlled build environments)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical setup script with a known pattern that involves executing a version file. While exec() can be risky if the file is compromised, in standard controlled environments, this is acceptable. No malicious intent or malware is evident.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1",
