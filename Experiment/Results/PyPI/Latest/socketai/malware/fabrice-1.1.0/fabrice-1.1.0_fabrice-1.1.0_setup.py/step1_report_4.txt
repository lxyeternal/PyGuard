{
  "purpose": "Configure and set up the Python package 'fabrice' with dependencies, version info, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', filesystem checks for directories 'fabric' and 'fabric2', reading '_version.py', reading 'README.rst', and static strings in setup()",
  "sinks": "Reading environment variables, filesystem access for directory checks, executing code from '_version.py', reading README file, setting package metadata and entry points",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2' influences package and binary names; filesystem checks determine package versioning; reading '_version.py' executes code that sets '__version__'; reading README for description; setup configuration uses static and dynamic data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code employs 'exec' to run '_version.py', which could be risky if the file is malicious, but is a common practice for version retrieval. No network or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads environment variables and filesystem data to configure package setup. The use of 'exec' on '_version.py' warrants attention but is typical for version extraction. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or malicious actions are evident. All dependencies are standard and used appropriately. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard package setup tasks with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The only potential concern is executing '_version.py', which is a common practice but should ensure '_version.py' is from a trusted source. Overall, the script appears safe.",
