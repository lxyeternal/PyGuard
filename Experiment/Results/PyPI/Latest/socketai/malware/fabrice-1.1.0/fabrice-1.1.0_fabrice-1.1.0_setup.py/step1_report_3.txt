  "purpose": "Configure and set up the packaging of a Python project, including dependencies, package discovery, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), filesystem (os.path), reading files (open), executing version file (exec).",
  "sinks": "exec() function with content from _version.py, reading README.rst, and setup() parameters.",
  "flows": "Environment variable or directory checks determine package name; reading _version.py for version; reading README for long description; executing setup() with all collected data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to read version information from an external file; reading README.rst without validation; no explicit validation or sanitization of external inputs.",
  "analysis": "The script sets package configuration for setuptools, dynamically determines package name based on environment variables and directory structure, and reads version info via exec() from a local file. Use of exec() introduces potential security risk if _version.py is maliciously altered, but in typical use, it is a controlled project file. Environment variables influence package behavior but do not perform malicious actions. No suspicious network or system calls are present. The code performs standard setup procedures without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard package setup with minimal security risk. The use of exec() on local version file is a potential concern but is common in package configurations. No malicious behavior detected. Overall security risk is low.",
