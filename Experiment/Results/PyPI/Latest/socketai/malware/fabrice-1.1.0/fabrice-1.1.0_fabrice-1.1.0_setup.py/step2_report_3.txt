  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports identify the use of `exec()` to run code from `_version.py` as a potential security concern. This is a common pattern in setup scripts to avoid import issues but can be risky if `_version.py` is compromised.\n- No reports mention network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- The code relies on environment variables and filesystem checks to determine package configuration, which is standard practice.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malware behavior are evident.\n- The overall security risk scores assigned are low (around 0.2), which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious payloads:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malware. The code performs typical setup operations.\n2. **Use of exec():** While risky if `_version.py` is compromised, in controlled build environments, this is generally acceptable. The reports correctly highlight this concern.\n3. **Environmental and filesystem checks:** They are used to configure package names and versions, which is standard.\n4. **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities beyond the exec() pattern, which is acknowledged.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher than 0.2 in some reports (up to 0.2), which is reasonable given the exec() pattern but still low overall.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — primarily due to the exec() pattern on `_version.py`. If `_version.py` is from a trusted source, this risk is minimal; if compromised, it could be exploited.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and reasonable. The main concern is the use of `exec()` to read `_version.py`, which is a known pattern but should be handled carefully. No evidence suggests malicious intent or malware.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- Ensure `_version.py` is from a trusted source.\n- Consider replacing `exec()` with a safer alternative, such as importing `_version.py` in a controlled environment, if security is critical.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type          | Final Value | Justification                                                                                     |\n|---------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware             | 0            | No malicious code or activity detected.                                                         |\n| Obfuscated          | 0            | Code is straightforward; no obfuscation present.                                                  |\n| Security Risk       | 0.2          | Due to use of `exec()` on `_version.py`, which could be risky if the file is compromised.        |\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to suggest specific improvements or further analysis.",
