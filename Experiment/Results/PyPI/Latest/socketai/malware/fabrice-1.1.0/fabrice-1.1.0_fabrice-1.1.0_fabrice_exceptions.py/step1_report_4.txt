{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for use in a larger Python project, likely related to task management or environment validation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception initializers; no external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as code is purely class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with docstrings explaining their intended use. There are no input/output operations, no data handling, nor any logic that could be exploited. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The presence of TODO comments indicates ongoing development but not malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward, safe module defining exceptions for error handling in a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and appears to serve as part of a larger application's error management. There are no signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
