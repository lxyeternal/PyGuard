  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application, likely related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external data input; exception classes are defined without reading data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior present. The code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code creates custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings. No data input, external interactions, or malicious constructs are present. No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious logic. The classes serve to encapsulate specific error conditions, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
