{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling within a larger Python application or library.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; exception class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; exception classes are used for control flow, not data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. These classes are used for handling specific error conditions and contain no dynamic or unsafe operations. They do not process or handle untrusted input, nor do they perform network operations, file I/O, or other risky behaviors. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is straightforward exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be standard, harmless code intended for error handling.",
