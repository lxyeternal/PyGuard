  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the underlying code carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm presence of issues in the code**\n\nThe code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions: `NothingToDo`, `GroupException`, and `InvalidV1Env`. These are straightforward, with no data processing, external I/O, or dynamic behavior. No issues such as code injection, data leaks, or malicious logic are present.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the correctness and logic of the report summaries**\n\nAll reports uniformly state that the code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious behavior. They correctly identify that these are simple exception class definitions, with no data flow or external interactions.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the above.\n\nThese scores seem reasonable and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\nNo issues or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is purely structural—defining exception classes for error handling. Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge assumptions or claims**\n\nThe reports assume that because the code only defines exception classes with no data processing, it is safe. This is accurate. There are no hidden behaviors or obfuscation.\n\n**Step 6: Consistency of scores**\n\nScores are consistent across reports and with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The code is benign and typical for error handling in Python projects.\n- The comments and docstrings suggest ongoing development, but nothing malicious.\n- No need for score adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n**The code is safe, straightforward, and free of security risks or malicious behavior.** The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis above.",
