  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions: `NothingToDo`, `GroupException`, and `InvalidV1Env`.\n   - There are no data processing, external I/O, or dynamic operations.\n   - The code is straightforward and static, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is only defining exception classes.\n   - They note the absence of data flow, external interactions, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are present in the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign, static class definitions.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code contains only exception class definitions with no dynamic or external behavior, a risk score higher than 0.0 or 0.1 would be unwarranted.\n   - The current scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - There is no malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as harmless.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made without evidence.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature—simple exception class definitions with no security concerns.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk present)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code snippet is purely structural, serving as part of an error handling framework. It poses no security threats or vulnerabilities.",
