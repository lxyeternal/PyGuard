  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the underlying code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines four custom exception classes:\n     - `NothingToDo` (inherits from `Exception`)\n     - `GroupException` (inherits from `Exception`, wraps a `.GroupResult`)\n     - `InvalidV1Env` (inherits from `Exception`)\n   - All classes contain minimal logic, primarily constructors with docstrings.\n   - No data processing, I/O, or external interactions are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for error handling in Python.\n\n2. **Security & Malware Assessment:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No data leaks, network activity, or code execution.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The exception classes are standard and serve a clear purpose within a larger application.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation detected.\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious intent or behavior.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** 0 — No vulnerabilities or risky code.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Flaws:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural and error handling related.\n   - No logical flaws or security issues are present.\n   - The comments and docstrings suggest possible future refactoring, but this does not impact current security.\n\n5. **Score Justification & Recommendations:**\n   - The scores assigned (all zeros for malware and obfuscated, security risk at 0) are appropriate.\n   - The high confidence (1.0) across reports aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No changes needed; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a set of standard, harmless exception class definitions used for error handling. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
