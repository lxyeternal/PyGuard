{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for error handling in a Python project, serving as structural components to manage specific error scenarios.",
  "sources": "The classes are used as error indicators; they do not read input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of simple exception class definitions with minimal logic, no external calls, data handling, or dynamic code execution. All classes serve as error indicators, and their implementation is standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores in the reports correctly reflect this assessment, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0. The code is safe, static, and typical for error handling in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, well-structured, and contains no malicious or security-related issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
