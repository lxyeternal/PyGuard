  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for specific error handling in a Python application, possibly related to task management or environment validation.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions and their __init__ methods.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code only defines exception classes without any data processing or external I/O.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code solely creates exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward class definitions with docstrings and minimal logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. These classes are used to signal specific error conditions. There are no inputs, data processing, or external communications; thus, no data leaks or malicious actions. The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and focused solely on error handling. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, consisting of standard exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
