{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions in a larger application, likely related to task execution and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No input data or external data reading; only class definitions and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines exception classes without any data handling or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings and comments. It does not perform any data input, output, or processing. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, code execution, or data leakage. The comments suggest possible future refactoring or movement of functionality but do not impact security. The exception classes are straightforward and do not contain any suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of custom exception classes with no malicious behavior or security issues. It is purely structural and intended for use in larger codebases. No security risks are present.",
