  "conclusion": "The code exhibits insecure handling of secrets through hardcoded credentials and environment variables, which could lead to credential leakage or misuse. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The security risk score is approximately 0.6, reflecting the insecure practices but no active malicious behavior."
