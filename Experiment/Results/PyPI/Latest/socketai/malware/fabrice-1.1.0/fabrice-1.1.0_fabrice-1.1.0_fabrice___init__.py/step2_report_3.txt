  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Package __init__.py, importing internal modules.\n- Findings: No untrusted data, no external communication, no anomalies.\n- Analysis: Standard import setup, benign.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar import structure for package API.\n- Findings: No external data flows, no anomalies.\n- Analysis: Standard, benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, package imports.\n- Findings: No suspicious activity.\n- Analysis: Standard static imports.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same import pattern.\n- Findings: No external data or malicious activity.\n- Analysis: Typical package structure.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, package setup.\n- Findings: No malicious behavior, just suppressing lint warnings.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Justification:\n\n- **Code Presence of Malicious Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is purely import statements for package setup, with no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no data processing, and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Since there's no evidence of data leaks, external communication, or malicious code, the security risk is negligible.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (consistent with all reports)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** Given the nature of the code, a risk score higher than 0.1 would be unwarranted. The scores are consistent across all reports and reflect the benign, structural nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe package initialization file with no malicious intent or security issues. The provided scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
