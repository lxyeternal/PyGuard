  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is a static setup script without data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All data appears static and standard for a Python package setup. No input reading, external data handling, or dynamic code execution detected. The dependencies and author info are publicly available and typical. No malicious or obfuscated code structures are present. The script's sole purpose is to facilitate package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured setup configuration.",
