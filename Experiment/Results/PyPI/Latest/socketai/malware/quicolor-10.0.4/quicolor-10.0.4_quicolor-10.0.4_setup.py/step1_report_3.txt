{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'quicolor', including its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own package metadata, dependencies from the 'install_requires' list, and the URL for the package repository.",
  "sink": "The code does not process untrusted input or data at runtime; it merely defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the setup script executes static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies without executing or importing runtime code that could be malicious. All data appears static and related solely to package configuration. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are processed. The dependencies and metadata are standard for Python package distribution. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a benign package configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical, straightforward setup for a Python package.",
