  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'quicolor' Python library",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or dynamic data sources; static package metadata",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; primarily configuration for package distribution",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; static metadata used for package setup",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures; straightforward setup configuration",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and other configuration details. It includes no user input handling, no code execution beyond static setup calls, and no suspicious or malicious behavior. All dependencies and metadata appear typical for a package intended for distribution on PyPI. No anomalies or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious behavior or security concerns are present.",
