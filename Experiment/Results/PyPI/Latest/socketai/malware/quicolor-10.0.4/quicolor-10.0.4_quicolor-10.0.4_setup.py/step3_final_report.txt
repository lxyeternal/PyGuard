  "flows": "None; static configuration without dynamic data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for Python packaging",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools, defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It contains no dynamic code, external input handling, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The dependency 'requests' is common and not suspicious. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The static, straightforward structure indicates no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments, justifying scores of 0 across malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The package is safe for use.",
