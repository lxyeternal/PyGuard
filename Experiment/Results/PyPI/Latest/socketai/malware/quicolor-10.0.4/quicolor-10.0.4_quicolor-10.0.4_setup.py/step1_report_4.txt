  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'quicolor' Python package, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static code: the setup() function parameters, including 'install_requires', 'url', and author info.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing, no code execution, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "N/A — static setup configuration with no dynamic data flows or input/output flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures; standard setup script without obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py file using setuptools to package a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The 'install_requires' only lists the 'requests' library, which is a common dependency. No dynamic code execution, environment variable manipulation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate setup for a Python utility library.",
