      "conclusion": "The primary concern is the execution of 'main()' during package installation, which could be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful code. This behavior introduces a significant security risk, and without inspecting 'main()', the maliciousness cannot be confirmed. The scores should reflect a high security risk and elevated malware potential, emphasizing caution and the need for further investigation."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, posing significant privacy and security concerns. While no malicious payloads or system damage are present, the activity is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. Malware scores should be moderate (~0.3), reflecting covert data collection, and security risk scores should be high (~0.8) due to privacy invasion. The code is not obfuscated. Overall, it warrants caution and further review, especially in supply chain contexts."
