  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple external URLs, possibly for tracking or reconnaissance purposes.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() which makes network requests to external URLs with query parameters containing system info",
  "flows": "System info sources → URL construction with system data → urlopen() request to external servers",
  "anomalies": "The URLs are suspicious, potentially malicious domains; sending hostname, username, and current directory info to remote servers without user consent; use of random number for request differentiation; no user notification or consent; indirect data exfiltration pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains. It appends a random number and system info as URL parameters, then makes HTTP GET requests to these URLs. This behavior suggests potential data exfiltration or tracking. The URLs are obscure and seem intentionally designed to hide malicious activity. The code does not perform any user interaction or explicit permission checks, which is suspicious. Overall, it appears to be collecting and transmitting environment info to external servers, possibly for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior indicative of data collection and transmission to unknown external servers, potentially for malicious tracking or exfiltration. The use of obscure URLs and collection of system details without user awareness are red flags. It should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious.",
