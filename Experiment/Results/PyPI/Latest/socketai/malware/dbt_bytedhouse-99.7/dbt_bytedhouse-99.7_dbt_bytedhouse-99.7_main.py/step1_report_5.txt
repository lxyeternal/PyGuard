  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() - sends data to external servers",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, current_path, rd_num) are included in URL parameters and sent over network to multiple URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious URLs with 'oast' domains, which are often used for testing or malicious purposes. Data is being collected and sent without user consent or obvious necessity.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, and current working directory, generates a random number, and sends this data to several external URLs via GET requests. The URLs are suspicious, potentially indicating tracking or data exfiltration. No user input validation or safeguards are present. The use of 'oast' domains suggests these are test or malicious endpoints. The code executes unconditionally, and data transmission occurs without any explicit user permission. The URL parameters include sensitive system info, which could leak private data. The overall structure is simple, but the intent appears to be monitoring or malicious data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely malicious or at least suspicious, as it collects system info and transmits it to suspicious domains without user consent. The use of 'oast' domains and data exfiltration patterns suggest malicious intent.",
