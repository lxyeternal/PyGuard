  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple external URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to external URLs with system info parameters",
  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current directory) -> URL encoding -> HTTP request to external domains",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits system info to suspicious, non-standard URLs without any user consent or obvious purpose; hardcoded URLs pointing to suspicious domains; no authentication or encryption used; use of random number as a request identifier.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, and current directory information. It generates a random number to append to each URL request. The URLs are non-standard and appear suspicious, potentially used for tracking or exfiltration. The data is sent via HTTP GET requests to these URLs. No validation, encryption, or user consent is evident. The code does not contain obfuscation or encrypted payloads but performs network requests to unknown domains, which is suspicious. No malicious code execution or system modification occurs. The primary concern is potential privacy invasion or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be collecting system info and sending it to suspicious external servers, which is potentially malicious for tracking or data theft. It does not perform harmful actions like file modification or system damage but raises privacy and security concerns.",
