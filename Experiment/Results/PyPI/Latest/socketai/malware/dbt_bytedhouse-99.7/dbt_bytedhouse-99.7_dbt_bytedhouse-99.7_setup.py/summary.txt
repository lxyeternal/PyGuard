  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the execution of 'main()' during package installation, which could be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful code. This behavior introduces a significant security risk, and without inspecting 'main()', the maliciousness cannot be confirmed. The scores should reflect a high security risk and elevated malware potential, emphasizing caution and the need for further investigation."
