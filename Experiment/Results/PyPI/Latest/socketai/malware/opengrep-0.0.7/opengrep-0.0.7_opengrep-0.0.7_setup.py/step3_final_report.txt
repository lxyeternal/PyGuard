{
  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for the 'opengrep' Python library.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points; no runtime input or external data reads.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without dynamic execution or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and adheres to typical setup.py patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup script using setuptools, defining package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points. No dynamic code, input handling, or external data fetching occurs. The entry point 'opengrep.main:main' is a reference to a function, not executed during setup. The code is human-readable, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0, which is justified given the static, standard structure.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a benign, standard package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk are appropriate and consistent with the static analysis.",
