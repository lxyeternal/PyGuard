  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malware. The code is a standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully benign. The reasoning is sound and consistent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** The script defines setup parameters, including an entry point that could execute code at runtime, but this is standard for CLI tools. No code execution occurs during setup, and no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The presence of an entry point does not imply maliciousness; it's typical for CLI tools.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, standard setup configuration with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical setup script with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code's static nature and standard structure, malware should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; all reports agree on this, so **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior, the overall security risk should be **0**.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a straightforward, standard `setup.py` configuration for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or hidden behaviors are present.\n- Entry points are typical for CLI tools and do not imply malicious intent.\n- The dependencies are common, and no code manipulation or obfuscation exists.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses and the nature of the code.",
