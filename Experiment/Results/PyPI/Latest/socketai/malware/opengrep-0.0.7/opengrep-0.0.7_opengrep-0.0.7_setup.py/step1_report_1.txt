  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the 'opengrep' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Constants, import statements, and the setup() function parameters such as name, version, author, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "None directly present; setup configuration does not execute or process untrusted data at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this static configuration; no runtime data processing occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; standard packaging script with no hardcoded credentials, hidden code, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() to configure package installation. The version is a simple string. No input reading, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. Dependencies are specified plainly, and no code injection, obfuscation, or malicious logic is evident. Entry points define CLI commands but do not include malicious code or external data fetching. The overall structure and content follow common package setup patterns, with no signs of tampering or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a standard, benign package configuration for the 'opengrep' project. It contains no malware, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. The package setup process is typical, with no evidence of malicious code or supply chain attacks.",
