  "purpose": "Analysis of Python package code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, hardcoded strings, dynamic imports, potential eval/exec calls.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, system commands, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input flow into code execution or network modules, potentially leading to data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic execution (eval/exec), hardcoded credentials or tokens, hidden imports, and suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in Reports 1, 2, 3, and 5, with no confirmed malicious activity. Report 4 contains obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and hardcoded secrets, indicating high suspicion. Scores are consistent with these observations: malware 0 in benign cases, 0.75 in the suspicious case; obfuscation scores align with the presence of obfuscation; risk scores reflect the overall threat level. The reasoning in each report appropriately matches the evidence, with no over- or underestimation.",
  "conclusion": "Most code samples are benign with low malware and risk scores. Report 4 shows significant obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting high suspicion and scores. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the described behaviors.",
