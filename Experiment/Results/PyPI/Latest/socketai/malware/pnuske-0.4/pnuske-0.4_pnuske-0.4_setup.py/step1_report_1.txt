{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for packaging the Python project 'pnuske', including its name, version, packages, and console entry point.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own configuration parameters and package structure to prepare for distribution.",
  "sinks": "The 'entry_points' specifies the executable command 'pnuske' which runs 'pnuske:run'. This could invoke code during installation or execution, but no direct untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows into package discovery and setting up the command-line entry point, which will invoke the 'run' function in the 'pnuske' module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be a straightforward setup script with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'setuptools' to configure package metadata and entry points. It calls 'find_packages()' to automatically include all packages. The 'entry_points' defines a CLI command 'pnuske' that executes 'pnuske:run'. There is no code execution, input handling, or data flow that could be malicious. The structure is standard for Python package setup files. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with a CLI command. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
