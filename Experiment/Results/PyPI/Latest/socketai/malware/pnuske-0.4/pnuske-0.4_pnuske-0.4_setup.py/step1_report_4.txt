{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'pnuske' Python package",
  "sources": "No external input sources; uses setuptools functions to define package configuration",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data or untrusted input processing or output points",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the script only defines package metadata",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata, including name, version, packages, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, input reading, or suspicious behavior detected. The entry point 'pnuske=pnuske:run' suggests a command-line interface for the package, which is typical. No obfuscated or malicious code elements found.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is straightforward and standard, serving to package a Python project without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
