  "conclusion": "The setup script is a typical, safe packaging configuration with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only caveat is the 'pnuske:run' function, which requires inspection in the 'pnuske' module to fully assess risk. Based solely on this script, the security risk is negligible, and the code is safe for use."
