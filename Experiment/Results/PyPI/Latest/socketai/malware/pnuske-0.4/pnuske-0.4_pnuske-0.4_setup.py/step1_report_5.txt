  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'pnuske'. It defines package metadata and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads package information and entry point definitions; no external data sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output points are present in this script.",
  "flows": "The script flows from defining package metadata to setting up entry points, with no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define a package named 'pnuske' with version 0.4 and sets up a command-line entry point 'pnuske'. It employs find_packages() to automatically discover packages, which is common practice. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data fetching. The setup appears straightforward and intended for standard packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a normal Python packaging script with no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
