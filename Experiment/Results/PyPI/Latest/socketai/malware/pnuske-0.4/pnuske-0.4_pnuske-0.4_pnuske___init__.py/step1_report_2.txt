{
  "purpose": "Imports the 'run' function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .main import run.",
  "sinks": "None in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there is no data flow in this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement; no anomalies detected in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a function named 'run' from a relative module 'main'. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or side effects on its own. The minimal nature of the code makes it unlikely to contain malicious behavior by itself. However, without additional context about the contents of 'main', it's impossible to assess the security implications of calling 'run' or its behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement with no inherent malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard pattern used in modular Python projects. No malicious indicators detected based on this fragment alone.",
