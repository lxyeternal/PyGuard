{
  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'main' and imports 'run' from it.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or output functions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'run' to potential future invocation within the module, but no execution or data flow is visible here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only a single import statement; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement, likely part of a larger script. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues within this snippet. It does not contain any hardcoded credentials, network activity, or data leakage points. The minimal nature of the code suggests it's a standard import, assuming the 'main' module and 'run' function are legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign. It performs a simple import with no malicious or security-risk indicators. Due to its simplicity, the confidence is high that there is no malicious intent or obfuscation present.",
