  "purpose": "Importing the 'run' function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads code from a local module 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data or output is shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible with this minimal code; only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports a function from a local module. There are no input sources, data processing, or external communication. Without additional context or code from 'main', no malicious activity can be inferred. The minimal nature suggests standard behavior or placeholder code.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, performing a simple import operation with no apparent malicious intent. There are no security risks or malware indicators identified.",
