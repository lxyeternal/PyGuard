{
  "purpose": "Minimal import statement from a local module, typical in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; import is static and benign.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import of 'run' from a local module 'main'. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The absence of data processing, external communication, or complex logic indicates a benign pattern. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The slight elevation of security risk score to 0.1 in one report appears unjustified given the minimal code. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity and benign nature of the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature; the minor security risk score can be lowered to 0 for full accuracy.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
