{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration using setuptools, specifying package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call, especially the 'install_requires' list and the find_packages() function.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; dependencies are listed but not executed or fetched in this script.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; dependencies are only declared, not downloaded or executed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns. The dependencies are standard libraries with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package info and dependencies. The dependencies are typical Python packages with specific version pins, which is normal for reproducible builds. No code execution, network activity, or input handling occurs. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply declares dependencies and package metadata.",
