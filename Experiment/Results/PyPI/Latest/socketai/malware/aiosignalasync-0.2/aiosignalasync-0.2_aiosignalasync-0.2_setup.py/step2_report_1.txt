  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies this as a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It notes that dependencies are fixed versions, with no malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — all consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; the report is accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly describes the script as a typical setup configuration. It mentions the potential for supply chain attacks via dependencies but finds no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the slight security risk is acknowledged, possibly due to dependency risks, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n- **Note:** The securityRisk score is slightly above zero, which is reasonable given the dependency-based attack surface, but no actual malicious activity is detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, confirms the script is a straightforward setup.py with no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the script is a benign setup configuration, with no dynamic code or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** all zeroes, consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: a standard setup.py with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** all zeroes, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence:** The code is a standard setup.py script, with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n- **Malware:** No evidence of malicious behavior or payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** The only minor concern is dependency management, which is common in supply chain attacks, but no actual malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified in static analysis)\n\n**Note:** While supply chain risks are always present when dependencies are involved, in this static context, no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a typical, benign Python packaging script.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The dependency list, while a potential attack vector in theory, shows no evidence of compromise or malicious payloads.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if further dynamic or runtime analysis is needed, but based on static review, the package appears safe.",
