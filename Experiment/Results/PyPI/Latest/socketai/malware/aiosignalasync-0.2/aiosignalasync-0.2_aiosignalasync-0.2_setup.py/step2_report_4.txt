  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup.py script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.5 (originally 0). The report assigns a security risk of 0, which seems appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities.\n- **Justification:** Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected, the scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly notes that the script is a typical setup configuration with fixed dependencies and no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. The report assigns a small security risk, perhaps considering supply chain attack potential if dependencies are compromised.\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score is reasonable, considering that dependency compromise could be a concern, but the script itself is benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, confirms the script is a standard setup file with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. No issues detected.\n- **Justification:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—benign setup script, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. No risks identified.\n- **Justification:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others; standard setup script, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, static setup script with no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n- The only point of potential concern is the reliance on fixed versions of dependencies, which could, in theory, be compromised upstream, but this is a common practice and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate 0, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the lack of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns, a risk score of 0.0–0.1 is appropriate. The second report's 0.1 reflects a minimal concern for supply chain issues, which is reasonable.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0–0.1 (considering supply chain concerns but no direct evidence)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured setup.py script with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
