{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an import statement for a larger module, exposing classes and enums likely used for cybersecurity or monitoring functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .ms, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling evident in this fragment; it only exports classes and enums.",
  "flows": "No data flow identified within this snippet as it contains only import and export statements.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enums from internal modules and then defines __all__ for module exports. There are no external data inputs, network communications, or dynamic code execution present. Without further context from the imported modules, it is not possible to determine malicious intent from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard module import and export setup. No malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks are apparent. It appears to be part of a larger project that may involve monitoring or cybersecurity tools, but nothing suspicious is evident here.",
