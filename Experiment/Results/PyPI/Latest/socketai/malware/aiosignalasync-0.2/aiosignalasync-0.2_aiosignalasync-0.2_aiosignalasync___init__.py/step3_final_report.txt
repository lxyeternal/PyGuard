  "purpose": "A module that imports classes and enums from internal modules and re-exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .ms, .enums, and .utils modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data leakage points present",
  "flows": "Importing classes and enums, then exposing via __all__ without data flow or dynamic execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern; no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific classes and enums from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The class names like 'KeyLogger' could be suspicious if their implementations are malicious, but in this snippet, only import statements are shown, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The code is clear, straightforward, and lacks obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. Given the absence of active malicious code or risky behavior, the malware score is 0. The presence of 'KeyLogger' alone does not imply malicious intent without further context. The security risk score should also be 0, as no security vulnerabilities or suspicious activity are demonstrated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for re-exporting internal components. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
