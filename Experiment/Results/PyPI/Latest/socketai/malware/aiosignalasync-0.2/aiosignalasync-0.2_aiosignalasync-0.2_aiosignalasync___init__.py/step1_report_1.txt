{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an import and export module, aggregating and exposing classes and enums for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Imports modules: .ms (Compute, KeyLogger), .enums (Senders, Features, Utils, Protectors), .utils (Loader, Grabber). No external data input is directly handled here.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks are evident in this snippet. No untrusted data handling or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "This module only imports and exports symbols; no data flow from sources to sinks occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior is present. The code is straightforward and conventional for a Python package index module.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports components from internal modules (.ms, .enums, .utils) and declares __all__ for namespace exposure. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, or obfuscation. The structure suggests it is part of a larger package, and its purpose is to organize and expose functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for Python packaging, and contains no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It merely re-exports components for use elsewhere.",
