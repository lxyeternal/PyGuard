  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; straightforward structure",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no functions, data processing, network calls, or external inputs. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and simple nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risk. The current scores are appropriate and accurate.",
