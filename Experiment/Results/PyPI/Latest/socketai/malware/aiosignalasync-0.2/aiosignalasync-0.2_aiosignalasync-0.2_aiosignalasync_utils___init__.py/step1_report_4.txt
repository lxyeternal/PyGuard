{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to autostart, messaging, loading, protection, and grabbing functionalities, and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Module imports from local package files: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data processing or external network calls are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly present; the code simply re-exports imported classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears to only declare and export modules without any suspicious logic or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic module imports and defines an export list. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, network activity, or code obfuscation. It only sets up module references for external use, which is standard practice. No unusual or suspicious code patterns are present. No potential security risks or malware indicators are detected based solely on these import statements.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign and serves as a module initializer or interface. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues.",
