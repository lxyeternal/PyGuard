  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; static import/export declarations",
  "flows": "Imports -> __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "None; code is static, minimal, and standard for module initialization",
  "analysis": "The code imports five classes from internal modules and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no data processing, network activity, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. Confidence is high (1), given the static and transparent nature of the code. No anomalies or risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard module setup with no security risks or malware indicators. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
