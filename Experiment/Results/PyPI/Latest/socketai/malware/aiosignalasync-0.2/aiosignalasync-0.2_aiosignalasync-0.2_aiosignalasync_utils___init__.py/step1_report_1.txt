{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports for a package, importing classes from internal modules for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes from internal modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only handles internal imports and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this snippet; it's purely import/export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present in this minimal code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several internal classes and declares an __all__ list for module exports. It lacks any input handling, data processing, or network communication. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior is observable. The structure is standard for Python packages establishing module exports.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a benign module export declaration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
