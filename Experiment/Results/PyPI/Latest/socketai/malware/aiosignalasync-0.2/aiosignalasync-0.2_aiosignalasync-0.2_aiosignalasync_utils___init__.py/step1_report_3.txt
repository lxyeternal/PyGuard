  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports several classes from relative submodules and defines an __all__ list for exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output functions",
  "flows": "Imports imported classes; no data flow involving external untrusted sources within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; only module imports and an __all__ list, no logic, input handling, or dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module import and export declaration. It imports five classes from sibling modules and makes them available for external use via __all__. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious indicators present in this minimal code snippet. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, and no external data handling is visible here.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup with no signs of malicious behavior. It simply organizes imports for a package. Based on this snippet alone, there are no security concerns or malware indications.",
