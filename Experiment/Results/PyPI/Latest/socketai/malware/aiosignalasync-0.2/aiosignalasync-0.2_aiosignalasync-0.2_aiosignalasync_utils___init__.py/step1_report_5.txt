  "purpose": "This code defines an __all__ list for a Python package, exporting specific classes from relative modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or untrusted data handling in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this code; it merely imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. The import structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports classes from relative modules and defines an export list. No processing, data input, or external communication occurs. Since it is a minimal, structural module, it cannot be evaluated as malicious based solely on this content. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module interface setup with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It appears to be a typical part of a larger package's structure.",
