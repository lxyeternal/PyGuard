  "conclusion": "The code is a benign abstract class template with a notable security concern: the presence of a method to disable SSL verification globally. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. The main risk is if the _create_unverified_https method is invoked, which could lead to security vulnerabilities. The malware score remains at 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The security risk score should be around 0.6, reflecting the potential danger of misuse."
