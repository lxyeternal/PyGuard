{
  "purpose": "The code implements a system protector module designed to detect virtual machines, debugging, and environment manipulation to prevent analysis or reverse engineering of a script.",
  "sources": "Inputs from environment variables (getenv, getuser), system information (getnode, system registry), external URLs (urlopen), and local file paths (path.exists).",
  "sinks": "Network requests (urlopen) and system registry access (QueryValueEx, OpenKey) are used to gather system info; no direct data exfiltration or malicious system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables, system info, and network checks flow from sources to conditional checks that may terminate execution if certain conditions are met.",
  "anomalies": "Use of urlopen for online checks could be used for environment detection; no explicit hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The import of 'aiosignalasync' modules may suggest obfuscation or hidden functionalities, but no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment and system checks such as process list, MAC address, computer name, user, server hosting status, fake HTTP simulation, and virtual machine detection via registry and file existence. These checks are standard anti-debugging/anti-VM techniques. No suspicious or malicious payloads, data leaks, or backdoors are evident. Use of network requests appears solely for environment detection. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious system modification observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a system protector employing anti-debugging and anti-VM techniques without evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It is designed to terminate execution if certain environment indicators are detected, typical of anti-analysis tools. No malicious signals identified.",
