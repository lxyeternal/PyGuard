{
  "purpose": "The code implements a keylogger that captures keystrokes and periodically reports them via Telegram, and also includes a class for collecting various system and browser data for potential exfiltration or analysis.",
  "sources": "Keyboard input via pynput's keyboard.Listener; system information through imported modules like System, Processes, etc.; data collection from various modules; network requests via requests.post to Telegram API.",
  "sinks": "Sending data over network to Telegram API; executing potentially unsafe processes and modules; creating zip archives and previews from collected data.",
  "flows": "Keystrokes captured by on_press are appended to log and sent via send_telegram_message; report() periodically calls send_telegram_message with collected keystrokes; the Compute thread collects system data and sends it through specified senders (Telegram).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of keylogger functionality with hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; usage of threading.Timer for periodic reporting; collection of extensive system/browser data for exfiltration; use of ssl._create_unverified_context disables SSL verification, potentially unsafe; the try-except in start() suppresses exceptions silently.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a keylogger that captures keystrokes and exfiltrates them via Telegram, with hardcoded credentials indicating malicious intent. It also includes a data collection class that gathers system, browser, and application data, possibly for further exfiltration. The use of unverified SSL context and silent exception handling increases security risks, and the overall structure suggests malicious data harvesting and potential remote control features. No obfuscation or hidden backdoors are explicitly detected, but the purpose and behavior are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be malicious, primarily due to its keylogger functionality with hardcoded credentials, data exfiltration via Telegram, and extensive system data collection. It likely aims to spy on and steal user information, constituting malware. The overall security risk is high, and caution should be exercised with this package.",
