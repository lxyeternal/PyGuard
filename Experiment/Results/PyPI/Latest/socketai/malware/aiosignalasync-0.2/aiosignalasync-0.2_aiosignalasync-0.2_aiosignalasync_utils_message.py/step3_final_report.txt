  "purpose": "Display a fake error message window using Windows API with configurable message content.",
  "sources": "Message content and title retrieved from MessageConfig object.",
  "sinks": "windll.user32.MessageBoxW displays the message; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "MessageConfig provides data to MessageBoxW via windll call.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling silently suppresses errors; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly invokes Windows API to show a message box with configurable content. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of MessageConfig introduces external dependency that could be manipulated, but the code itself remains benign. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this analysis. The primary concern is external configuration content, not the code logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility to display a configurable fake error message. No malware or obfuscation detected. The low security risk score is appropriate, primarily considering potential misuse if MessageConfig is maliciously altered.",
