  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Issue Presence in Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward import and export pattern, with no signs of data processing, network activity, or untrusted data handling. The code is standard for a Python package's `__init__.py` or similar module.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic**:  \n   No logical errors or flaws are apparent. The code's purpose is clear and correctly implemented.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 1. Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior, these scores seem appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all scores are 0 or 1, and the code is benign, no high risk scores are justified here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports are cautious and reasonable, assuming standard behavior without unwarranted suspicion.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThis code snippet is a typical module initialization pattern importing classes from local modules and exposing them via `__all__`. It contains no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**My own estimates** align with the reports:\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Final note**: No further action is needed; the code is safe and standard.",
