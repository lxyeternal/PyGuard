  "purpose": "This code appears to define the public API of a Python package by importing specific classes from local modules and exporting them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data handling in this snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only manages imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for defining module exports",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__, a common pattern in Python package design. There are no signs of input handling, data processing, or external communication. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic are present. The structure is simple and typical for module organization, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import and export pattern with no malicious behavior detected. It simply organizes the package's public interface.",
