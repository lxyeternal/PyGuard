{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package __init__.py or module interface, importing classes from local modules and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports from local modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package module that imports classes from local modules and defines __all__ for API exposure. It contains no dynamic behavior, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, reflecting the benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and static import pattern indicate a safe, well-structured component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign package interface with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The assessments are accurate and consistent; no further action is necessary.",
