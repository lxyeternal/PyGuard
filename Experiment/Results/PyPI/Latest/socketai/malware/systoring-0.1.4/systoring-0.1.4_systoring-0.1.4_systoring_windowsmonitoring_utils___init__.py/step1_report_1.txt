{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from local modules and defines an export list, likely part of a larger Python package module initialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads from its own module files (.ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb) when importing classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing classes from local modules and exposing them via __all__, with no data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or untrusted data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are present. The structure is simple and typical for Python package __init__.py files, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script that imports and exposes classes. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or obfuscation present. The overall security risk is very low.",
