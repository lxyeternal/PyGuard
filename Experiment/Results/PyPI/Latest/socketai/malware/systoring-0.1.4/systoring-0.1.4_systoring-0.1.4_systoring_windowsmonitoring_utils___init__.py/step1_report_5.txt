  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports classes from sibling modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; import statements do not directly handle untrusted input",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only performs static imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports classes from local modules and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic execution, input handling, or network communication. No suspicious or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module interface that imports and exposes classes. No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are detected.",
