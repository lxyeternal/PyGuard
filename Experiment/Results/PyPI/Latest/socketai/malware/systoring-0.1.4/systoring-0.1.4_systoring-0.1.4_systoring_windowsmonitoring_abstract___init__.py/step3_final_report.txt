  "purpose": "Minimal Python module that imports AbstractSender from a local sender module and exposes it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .sender module",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations",
  "flows": "Import of sender.py potentially executing code upon import (external concern, outside scope)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module declaration with an import and __all__ definition. It contains no logic, data flows, or embedded code. The only external concern is the content of sender.py, which could contain malicious code, but this is outside the scope of this snippet. The code itself is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module declaration with no malicious or security issues. The potential risk depends on sender.py, which is outside this scope. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and overall risk at approximately 0.1 due to dependency concerns. No modifications are necessary.",
