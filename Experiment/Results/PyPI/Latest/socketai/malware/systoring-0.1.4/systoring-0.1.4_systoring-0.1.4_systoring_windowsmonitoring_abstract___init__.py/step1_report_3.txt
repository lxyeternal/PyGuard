  "purpose": "This code defines an import statement for AbstractSender from a local sender module and exposes it publicly.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.sender' during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output operations are performed.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present; the code only imports and exposes a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no apparent anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module and sets __all__ for public API exposure. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, network operations, or other suspicious behaviors. The simplicity indicates standard module structuring.",
  "conclusion": "There is no indication of malicious behavior or security issues in this snippet. It appears to be a straightforward module definition.",
