{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define the public API for a module by importing and exporting the AbstractSender class.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .sender import AbstractSender",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink, as there are no runtime data inputs or outputs",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code, no suspicious constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization that imports a class from a relative module and sets the __all__ variable for exports. There is no logic, data processing, or external interaction. It appears to be a standard pattern for defining module exports in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a simple, benign module declaration with no suspicious elements.",
