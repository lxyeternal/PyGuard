  "purpose": "Export the AbstractSender class from the sender module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the sender module, which could potentially execute code upon import if sender.py contains malicious code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads sender.py; only the exported name is exposed via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code; no obvious anomalies or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class and declares an export list. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. The only potential concern is the import statement, which relies on the sender module. If sender.py contains malicious code, it could execute during import. However, this code snippet itself shows no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module export statement with no malicious behavior visible. The main security consideration is the content of sender.py, which is outside the scope of this snippet.",
