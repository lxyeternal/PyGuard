  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module import and export statement, facilitating access to classes and enums related to Windows monitoring and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data handling or external output observed",
  "flows": "N/A – No data flow from source to sink; only import/export statements",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions; only module references",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes and enums from local modules and defines what symbols are publicly available. It does not execute any logic, handle data, or perform operations that could be malicious. No anomalies such as suspicious variable names or unusual constructs are present. The structure indicates a standard package __init__.py file or similar module aggregation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module import/export statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
