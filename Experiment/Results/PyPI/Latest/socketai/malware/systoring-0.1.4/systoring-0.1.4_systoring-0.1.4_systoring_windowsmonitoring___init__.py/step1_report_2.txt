{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an import interface for a larger Python project, exposing specific classes and enums for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules are aggregated into __all__, enabling external access",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code features detected; simple import statements",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes and enums from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. No external data inputs, network activity, or execution of dynamic or malicious code are present. It appears to be a standard module index file. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior; all code references are typical for Python package structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports and exposes components. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
