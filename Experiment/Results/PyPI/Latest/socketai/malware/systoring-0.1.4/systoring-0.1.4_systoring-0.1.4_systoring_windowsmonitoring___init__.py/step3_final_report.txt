{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or index file that imports specific classes and enums from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process input or output data",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and exports symbols without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and follows standard module pattern",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import/export module with no logic, data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. It contains no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk (~0 or 0.1). The code's benign nature and lack of malicious behavior are consistent with the assessments. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initializer with no malicious or security concerns. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. The scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
