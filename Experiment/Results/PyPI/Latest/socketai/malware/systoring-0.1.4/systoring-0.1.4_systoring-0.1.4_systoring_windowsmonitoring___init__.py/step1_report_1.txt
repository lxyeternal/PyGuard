{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an initialization or import module that exposes specific classes and enumerations for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No data processing, input/output, or external data handling present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors; only straightforward imports and __all__ declaration",
  "analysis": "The code only imports classes and enums from relative modules and defines an __all__ list for module exports. It contains no logic, data handling, or external communication. No indications of obfuscation or malicious intent are visible. As it serves as an interface to other modules, the security risk relies on those modules rather than this snippet itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a module initializer for exposing specific classes and enums, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It appears benign.",
