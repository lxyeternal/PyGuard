{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to serve as an import/export interface, organizing and exposing classes and constants for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks; this code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations on external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; it only imports and re-exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and constants from local modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no input processing, no network operations, or any suspicious behaviors. The structure is typical for Python package modules intended to organize and expose internal components. No signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export file with no malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to organize and expose components, with no evidence of supply chain threats or malicious intent.",
