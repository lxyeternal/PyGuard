{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an import and export module, aggregating classes and constants from various submodules for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.windowsmonitoring', '.enums', and '.utils' modules, specifically importing classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code only imports modules and defines __all__ for exports.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code solely performs imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports specific classes and constants from sibling modules and defines an explicit export list. It does not process or handle data directly. The imported modules might contain security-relevant logic, but based solely on this code snippet, there are no malicious behaviors or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as an aggregator or interface for other modules and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior on its own. It appears safe and typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module aggregation file.",
