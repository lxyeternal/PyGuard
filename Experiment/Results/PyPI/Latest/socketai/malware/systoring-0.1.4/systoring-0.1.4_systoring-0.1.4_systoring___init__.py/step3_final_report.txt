  "sinks": "No sinks; code only imports modules based on OS detection.",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> conditional import of WindowsMonitoring -> module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward platform detection and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system using platform.system(), converts it to lowercase, and conditionally imports WindowsMonitoring if on Windows. It unconditionally imports MacMonitoring, initialize_system_monitoring, and InputMonitor modules. The code is static, simple, and follows standard cross-platform import patterns. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious activities are evident. The platform detection logic is common and safe, with minimal security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard platform detection and module imports without any malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
