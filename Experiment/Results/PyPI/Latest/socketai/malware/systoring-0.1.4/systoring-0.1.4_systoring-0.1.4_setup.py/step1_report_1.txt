  "purpose": "Setup script for a cross-platform system monitoring library named 'systoring', intended for educational purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description; fetches package dependencies via install_requires and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks related to untrusted data or network operations; primarily configuration and dependency specification.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> loads dependencies and package info -> configures package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Usage of common setup tools; dependencies are standard, with platform-specific extras.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script utilizing setuptools for package configuration. It reads a markdown file for description and specifies dependencies, including platform-specific extras. No suspicious or malicious code segments, no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or network activity. The dependencies listed are common for system monitoring libraries. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a typical setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, and no anomalies or suspicious code are identified.",
