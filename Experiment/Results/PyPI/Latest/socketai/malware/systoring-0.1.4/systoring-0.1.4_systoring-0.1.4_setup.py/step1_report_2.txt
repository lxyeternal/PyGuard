  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'systoring', including metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, importing 'setuptools', and calling 'setup()' with parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output functions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README file into 'long_description' and from the 'setup()' parameters into package installation metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a markdown README file to set the long description, then calls 'setup()' to specify package metadata, dependencies, and platform-specific extras. There are no dynamic code executions, network connections, or handling of untrusted input. All dependencies are specified with version constraints. The code appears to be a standard Python package setup script with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures package installation parameters.",
