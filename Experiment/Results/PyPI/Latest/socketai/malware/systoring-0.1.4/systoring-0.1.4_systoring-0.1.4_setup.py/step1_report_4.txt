  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'systoring' Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; package dependencies specified in install_requires and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data directly; no sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the code is a straightforward setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The script reads a file and specifies dependencies normally.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It reads a Markdown file for the long description and sets package metadata, dependencies, and optional dependencies for Windows and macOS. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no code execution from untrusted sources, and no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It is safe and contains no security risks.",
