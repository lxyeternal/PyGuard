  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'systoring' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and platform-specific extras.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; defines dependencies and extras.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reading local file 'README.md' for description; setting package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns. It reads a local README file, specifies dependencies, and platform-specific extras. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The minimal security risk score (~0.1) assigned in some reports is likely due to reading a local file, which is standard and not risky. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The slight elevation in security risk scores (0.1) in some reports is an overestimate; given the benign nature, these should be adjusted to 0.0 for accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The minor security risk scores are slightly overstated but do not indicate any real threat. Overall, the package is safe for use, and the reports are consistent with this assessment.",
