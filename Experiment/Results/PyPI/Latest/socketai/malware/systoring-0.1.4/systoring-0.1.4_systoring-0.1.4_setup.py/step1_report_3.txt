  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'systoring', including metadata, dependencies, and optional requirements for Windows and macOS platforms.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "Reads the content of a local file ('README.md') and passes dependency specifications to the setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be standard setup script for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, reads a markdown file for the long description, and invokes setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and optional dependencies for Windows and macOS. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The dependencies listed are standard libraries related to input handling and platform-specific modules. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident in this setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve its purpose of package configuration without any hidden or harmful code.",
