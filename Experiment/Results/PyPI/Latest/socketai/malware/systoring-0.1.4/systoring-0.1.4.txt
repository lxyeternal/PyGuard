The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and overall risk at approximately 0.1 due to dependency concerns. No modifications are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as an anti-analysis and environment detection module, employing techniques typical in malware but not executing malicious actions itself. The low malware score and absence of malicious payloads indicate it is benign in isolation. The primary concern is its potential misuse in malicious contexts, but based solely on this code, it poses minimal risk."

Its behavior aligns with patterns of malicious or sabotage activity, warranting a high malware score and security alert. The code should not be used with untrusted sources without proper validation, sanitization, and error handling."
