  "purpose": "Initialize system monitoring based on the current platform, starting input and system-specific monitors in separate threads.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for OS detection, imports from systoring modules for monitoring functionalities",
  "sinks": "Thread creation and start calls for running monitoring functions",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> threading.Thread(target=...) -> thread.start()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code structures observed. No use of dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the OS using platform.system(), then initializes input monitoring and platform-specific system monitoring in separate threads. The imported modules appear to be part of the systoring package, which suggests monitoring functionality for Mac and Windows systems. The threading implementation is straightforward and does not involve unsafe practices. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert activities are evident. The code performs environment detection and starts monitoring tasks, which is typical for system management software.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a platform-aware monitoring initializer, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It simply sets up input and system monitoring threads based on OS detection, with no suspicious behavior observed.",
