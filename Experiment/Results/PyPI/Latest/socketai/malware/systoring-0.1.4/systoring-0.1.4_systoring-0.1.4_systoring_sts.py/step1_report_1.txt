{
  "purpose": "Initialize system monitoring based on the platform (macOS or Windows) and start monitoring threads for input and system events.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call to determine OS; instantiation of InputMonitor, MacMonitoring, WindowsMonitoring classes; thread start methods.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; threads invoke methods that likely monitor system input or activity.",
  "flows": "platform.system() output influences which monitoring thread is started; InputMonitor().start_monitoring() runs in a thread; platform check determines which system monitor thread runs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code dynamically starts system monitoring threads based on OS.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system and starts corresponding monitoring threads, which is a common behavior for system monitoring tools. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious backdoors, or suspicious activity. The imported classes suggest monitoring functionality but do not inherently imply malicious intent. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be part of a legitimate system monitoring setup that conditionally initializes monitoring processes based on the platform. No malicious behavior or malware indicators are detected, and it seems designed for legitimate oversight or diagnostic purposes.",
