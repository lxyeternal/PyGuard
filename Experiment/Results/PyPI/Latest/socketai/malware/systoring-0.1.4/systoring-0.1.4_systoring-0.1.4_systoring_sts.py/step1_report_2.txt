  "purpose": "Initialize and start platform-specific system monitoring and input monitoring threads",
  "sources": "platform.system() to determine OS, instantiation of monitoring classes (MacMonitor, WindowsMonitor), and input_monitor.start()",
  "sinks": "thread target functions (MacMonitor().run, WindowsMonitor().run, InputMonitor().start_monitoring)",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> conditionals -> threading.Thread(target=monitoring functions) -> start()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. Usage of threading is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system and initializes input and system monitoring in separate threads. It uses well-known classes imported from modules that appear to be dedicated to monitoring purposes. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious external connections. The imported modules' names suggest legitimate system monitoring functions. No anomalies or unusual code patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of system and input monitoring tailored for macOS and Windows, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
