      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation poses a significant security risk, especially if 'main()' is malicious. While the code itself is not obfuscated or malicious, this pattern is a common attack vector. The overall malware suspicion should be high (around 0.8), and the security risk similarly elevated. Further inspection of 'main()' is recommended before trusting or deploying this package."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through silent data exfiltration to suspicious domains, justifying high malware and security risk scores. It is not obfuscated, but its activity poses significant privacy and security concerns. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, and the activity warrants classification as malicious or highly suspicious."
