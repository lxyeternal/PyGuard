{
  "purpose": "The code executes a custom install class that, during installation, imports and runs the 'main' function from a local module, potentially executing arbitrary code during package installation.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method of 'CrazyInstallStrat' which calls 'main()' from 'main' module.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during install, which could run malicious code or payloads.",
  "flows": "During 'install', 'run()' executes 'install.run(self)' then imports and calls 'main()' from 'main' module.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of 'main()' during install without validation, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that, upon running, executes 'main()' from a local module. This pattern allows arbitrary code execution during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The code itself is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The primary concern is the execution of external code ('main()') without validation, which could be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful instructions. The reported scores vary, but generally recognize the suspicious pattern. Without inspecting 'main()', the potential for malicious activity remains, warranting caution. The scores should reflect the high risk of executing untrusted code during install, with malware suspicion set around 0.8, security risk similarly high, and obfuscation at 0.0.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation poses a significant security risk, especially if 'main()' is malicious. While the code itself is not obfuscated or malicious, this pattern is a common attack vector. The overall malware suspicion should be high (around 0.8), and the security risk similarly elevated. Further inspection of 'main()' is recommended before trusting or deploying this package.",
