  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation poses a significant security risk, especially if 'main()' is malicious. While the code itself is not obfuscated or malicious, this pattern is a common attack vector. The overall malware suspicion should be high (around 0.8), and the security risk similarly elevated. Further inspection of 'main()' is recommended before trusting or deploying this package."
