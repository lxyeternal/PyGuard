  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to multiple remote URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests to external URLs with system info and a random number as query parameters.",
  "flows": "System info and random number are embedded into URL parameters, then sent over network requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs used are suspicious, hosting domains that look like obfuscated or malicious domains. The code collects system info without user consent or obvious purpose. The use of multiple URLs to exfiltrate data suggests potential data collection or command-and-control behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, and current directory, then sends this data along with a random number to multiple external URLs. The URLs are not associated with known benign services and are potentially malicious. No user interaction or explicit permission prompts are present. The code appears designed to silently exfiltrate environment data, possibly for malicious tracking or control. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, and no direct malware activities such as damaging files or mining are evident. However, the behavior of stealthily transmitting system info to suspicious domains indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script exfiltrates system information to external suspicious domains, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. The usage of obscure URLs and automatic data transmission without user consent poses security concerns.",
