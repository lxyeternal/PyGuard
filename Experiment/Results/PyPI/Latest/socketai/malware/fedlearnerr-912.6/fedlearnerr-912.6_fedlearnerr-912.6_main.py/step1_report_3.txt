  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current directory) → URL parameters → HTTP requests to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Multiple external URLs potentially used for data exfiltration; no clear benign purpose; data sent includes hostname, username, and current directory; dynamic URL with random number; no user interaction or explicit consent.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers basic system information: hostname, username, current working directory, and a random number. It constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to potentially suspicious domains. The URLs belong to known suspicious domains, and the purpose appears to be exfiltration of system identifiers. The code does not perform any apparent legitimate task and communicates with external servers without any user confirmation. The use of random numbers in the URL indicates attempts to avoid detection or cache busting. No benign functionality is evident, and the code could be used for tracking, surveillance, or malicious reconnaissance.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting system data and transmitting it to external, potentially malicious domains without user consent. It appears designed for tracking or reconnaissance activities, with no legitimate purpose evident. High likelihood of malicious intent.",
