      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious activity through data exfiltration, external downloads, and insecure subprocess usage. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The reports are accurate, though they slightly overstate the purpose of the curl command as 'obtaining cwd'; it actually downloads a file. Overall, the package should be considered compromised with high severity."
