  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), getpass.getuser(), subprocess.check_output(), requests.get()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() sending data to external URL, subprocess executing curl command",
  "flows": "gethostname()/getuser() and subprocess output are sent via requests.get() to external server",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to run curl with hardcoded URL, collecting hostname, username, and possibly executing commands to retrieve system info",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon installation, collects system hostname and username. It executes a curl command to download a file from a suspicious URL, storing the output in a variable 'cwd'. It then sends this data to an external tracking URL using the requests library. The use of subprocess with a hardcoded URL and sending data to an external domain indicates possible data exfiltration or malicious tracking. The curl command's target URL appears suspicious, and the collected info could be used for malicious purposes. No malicious payloads or backdoors are explicitly present, but the behavior resembles data collection and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by executing an external command to download a file and sending system info to an external domain, indicating possible malicious intent. It is likely used for tracking or exfiltration, which is malicious in the context of supply chain security.",
