{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, executes additional code to gather system information and send it to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information using socket.gethostname() and getpass.getuser(), and executes an external curl command via subprocess to download a file, which is then used as a variable (cwd). It also reads network data from the requests library.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to an external URL using requests.get() with parameters containing hostname, cwd, and username, and executes an external command via subprocess.check_output.",
  "flows": "The system info (hostname, username, cwd) are gathered as sources. The external curl command execution acts as a flow that sets 'cwd'. The gathered data flows into a GET request to an external URL via requests.get().",
  "anomalies": "The curl command downloads a file from a suspicious URL and overwrites 'cwd' with its output, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The data exfiltration to an external domain without user consent is suspicious. Using subprocess with shell=True to run curl is a security risk.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard setup process by extending the install command to execute code that collects hostname and username. It then runs a curl command via subprocess to download a file from a third-party URL, which may be malicious or used for malicious purposes. The output of the curl command is assigned to 'cwd', which is then sent as part of a GET request to an external endpoint, potentially exfiltrating system data. The use of shell=True with subprocess is a security concern. The external URL for data transmission is suspicious, indicating potential data exfiltration or malicious tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior including data exfiltration of system information to an external server, executing external commands with shell=True, and downloading files from suspicious URLs. These behaviors are indicative of malicious intent or at least malicious activity during package installation. It should be considered malicious or compromised.",
