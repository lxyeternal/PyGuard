{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform a custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to a remote server, likely for tracking or malicious data collection purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (socket.gethostname()), username (getpass.getuser()), and executes a curl command via subprocess to download a file; makes an HTTP GET request to a remote URL with collected data.",
  "sinks": "Requests to 'https://eojs8k35b24avi1.m.pipedream.net' with system info, subprocess execution of a curl command that downloads a potentially malicious file.",
  "flows": "Collects hostname and username, executes curl command to download a file, then sends hostname, current working directory (obtained via curl), and username to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom curl command to download a file from a suspicious URL, which is unrelated to the script's apparent purpose; the URL used in requests is a pipedream endpoint potentially for data exfiltration; executing shell commands via subprocess with shell=True can be dangerous; no validation or sanitization of inputs or outputs; the download URL and remote server are suspicious and possibly malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard 'install' command to execute additional code during package installation. It retrieves system information like hostname and username. It then runs a curl command to download a file from a suspicious URL, saving it to a directory with a potential typo in 'dependency-confusion-expoit' (likely meant 'exploit'). It captures the output (likely the current working directory) from this curl command, which is odd because curl is fetching a remote file, not executing or returning the directory. It then sends collected data (hostname, cwd, username) via an HTTP GET request to a remote server. The URL used in requests and the file download URL suggest possible malicious intent, such as exfiltrating system info or executing further malicious payloads. The code's structure and flow are typical for malicious supply chain attacks or data theft, leveraging package installation as a vector. No legitimate or benign purpose for downloading files or sending data to these endpoints is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior, including downloading a file from a suspicious URL and exfiltrating system information to an external endpoint during package installation. These actions indicate potential malicious intent, likely to exfiltrate data or deploy malicious payloads. The script's design and the external URLs involved raise significant security concerns.",
