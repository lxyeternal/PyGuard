{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with a custom installation step that collects system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), getpass.getuser(), subprocess.check_output(custom_curl_command), requests.get()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() (sending data to external URL), subprocess execution of curl command (potentially downloading files or executing commands)",
  "flows": "Gather hostname, username, and execute curl to obtain cwd, then send all data via HTTP GET request to external server",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded curl command to download a file from an external URL, sending system info to a third-party server, potential misuse of subprocess with shell=True, no validation of the downloaded content, no error handling for requests",
  "analysis": "The script includes a custom install class that, during installation, collects hostname and username, then executes a curl command to download a file from a specific URL, saving it to a fixed path. The command is executed with shell=True, which is risky. After that, it sends the hostname, current directory (from the curl download), and username to an external server via requests.get(). The use of a hardcoded URL and data exfiltration indicates malicious intent, especially since the information is sent without user consent. No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward. The script appears to attempt to gather system data and send it to a third party during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by collecting system information and exfiltrating it to an external server during package installation. The use of hardcoded URLs, subprocess with shell=True, and data transmission indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
