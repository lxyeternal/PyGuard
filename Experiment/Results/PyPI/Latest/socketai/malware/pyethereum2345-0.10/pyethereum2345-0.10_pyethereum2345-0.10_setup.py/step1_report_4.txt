  "purpose": "Custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to an external URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), getpass.getuser(), subprocess.check_output() with curl command, requests.get()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() sending data to an external server, subprocess executing shell command",
  "flows": "hostname and username are collected, a curl command is executed to retrieve a file path, then all data is sent via HTTP GET request to an external URL",
  "anomalies": "Use of a curl command to download a file during setup, sending system info to an external URL without user consent, executing shell commands with subprocess, hardcoded URL and file paths",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to perform additional actions during package installation. It collects hostname and username information. Instead of typical setup procedures, it executes a curl command to download a file from an external URL, which appears unrelated to package setup. It then sends collected system data (hostname, current working directory from the curl command, and username) to an external endpoint via a GET request. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or malicious tracking, especially given the context of downloading potentially malicious content and transmitting system info without user knowledge. The use of subprocess with shell=True and hardcoded URLs are security risks. The code does not perform any package-related setup tasks and instead executes potentially malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, including data exfiltration, executing external commands during installation, and downloading external content that could be malicious. These actions pose security risks and indicate probable malicious intent.",
