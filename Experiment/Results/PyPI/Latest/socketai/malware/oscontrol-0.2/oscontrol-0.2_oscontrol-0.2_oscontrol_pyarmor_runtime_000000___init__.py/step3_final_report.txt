{
  "purpose": "Import the Pyarmor runtime module for protected code execution, likely part of obfuscation or licensing enforcement.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module '.pyarmor_runtime' during import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data leaks are present; the code only imports a module.",
  "flows": "Import statement from local module; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with a comment indicating a Pyarmor trial; no suspicious behavior or anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a runtime module associated with Pyarmor, a legitimate obfuscation tool, with a comment indicating a trial version. No dynamic execution, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The minimal import suggests a protected or obfuscated codebase. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.1-0.2, risk=0-0.1) are consistent with this benign, protected context. No evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement used for code protection via Pyarmor. No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior are present. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
