  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of an import statement from a local module named `__pyarmor__` or `pyarmor_runtime`.\n- All reports mention a comment indicating the use of a Pyarmor trial version, which is typical for obfuscated or protected code.\n- No dynamic code execution, data input/output, network activity, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The code appears to be part of a protected codebase, likely for licensing or obfuscation purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippets **do** import a module named `__pyarmor__` or similar, consistent with Pyarmor's runtime modules.\n- There are **no signs of malicious behavior** such as data leaks, network activity, or code injection.\n- The presence of a trial version comment is standard for protected code but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n### Logical and reasoning issues:\n- All reports correctly interpret the code as benign, related to obfuscation/protection.\n- The reasoning that these snippets are not malicious and are part of a legitimate obfuscation tool is sound.\n- No assumptions are made beyond what the code indicates.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) is reasonable, considering the code is part of an obfuscation tool but minimal.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Security risk:** Also very low, consistent with the absence of suspicious activity.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code and analysis.\n- The higher confidence scores (0.9 to 1) are justified given the context and minimal code.\n- No changes needed in the scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on all reports and the code:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.1–0.2 (minor obfuscation indicator)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0–0.1 (negligible security risk)\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, protected nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard import of a Pyarmor runtime module, with comments indicating a trial version. No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe; no further action required.",
