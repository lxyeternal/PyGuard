{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ attribute from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or runtime protection.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __pyarmor__ from pyarmor_runtime module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leakage points evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only a module import occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating usage of Pyarmor trial version, which is typically used for code obfuscation. No malicious code or suspicious behavior is directly observable in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a runtime component from a package likely used for code obfuscation or licensing enforcement. The comment suggests it's a trial version, but does not by itself indicate malicious intent. No signs of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The structure is minimal, and the import appears standard for protected Python code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple import statement associated with the Pyarmor obfuscation tool. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this fragment. It is consistent with legitimate code protected by Pyarmor.",
