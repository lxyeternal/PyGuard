{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ attribute from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for runtime obfuscation or licensing management.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the current module and the pyarmor_runtime module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code only performs an import statement.",
  "flows": "The import statement loads __pyarmor__ from the pyarmor_runtime module, which may be used later in the application, but no flow is explicitly shown.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating trial version and a timestamp, which suggests licensing or obfuscation tooling. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a single import statement and a comment. The comment indicates this is part of Pyarmor, a known obfuscation tool, and mentions a trial license. No data input, data output, or dynamic code execution observed. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. The import could be used for runtime licensing or obfuscation purposes but does not itself pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be part of a legitimate obfuscation or licensing mechanism provided by Pyarmor. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this minimal code fragment.",
