  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or licensing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __pyarmor__ from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to untrusted destinations",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports a module",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a Pyarmor trial version comment; minimal code with no malicious indicators",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement related to Pyarmor, a tool used for obfuscating and protecting Python code. The comment indicates a trial version, but there are no active operations, data processing, or network activity. The code itself appears benign, serving as part of an obfuscated or protected script setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or suspicious activity. It is a simple import statement related to Pyarmor protection, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
