{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module for code obfuscation or protection.",
  "sources": "The code reads a local module named __pyarmor__ from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating use of Pyarmor trial version; no suspicious code behaviors or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module __pyarmor__ from a relative package, which is typical for code protected or obfuscated with Pyarmor. The comment indicates Pyarmor 9.0.6 trial, suggesting code is protected or packaged with Pyarmor. No dynamic execution, input reading, or data transmission is present. No malware indicators or suspicious patterns are evident. The code is minimal and appears as part of an obfuscation or protection scheme.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely imports a runtime module related to code obfuscation/protection and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign part of a protected codebase.",
