{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for executing or protecting Python code with Pyarmor encryption.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module filename, version info, and date comments, but does not take external input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs a module import.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating a trial version of Pyarmor; no suspicious or malicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a runtime component from the Pyarmor package, which is a legitimate tool for code obfuscation and protection. The comment indicates it is a trial version. No input/output handling, network activity, or other suspicious operations are present. The code is minimal and appears to serve a protective purpose rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely responsible for importing a Pyarmor runtime module for code protection purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
