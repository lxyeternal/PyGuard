  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Pyarmor runtime loader with encrypted payloads, used for licensing or protection. It exhibits high obfuscation but no direct malicious activity. Static analysis suggests low malware risk, with moderate concern due to obfuscation. The scores are justified; dynamic analysis should be performed for definitive confirmation."
