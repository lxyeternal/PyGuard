  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to define package metadata and requirements. It includes no dynamic code execution, no input parsing, and no potentially malicious functions. All parameters are hardcoded and standard for package distribution. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py is a typical package configuration script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
