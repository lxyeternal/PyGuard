  "purpose": "A standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields such as name, version, packages, description, author, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup.py script employing setuptools with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard packaging practices confirm its benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present, and the code does not perform any external network operations or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are accurate and justified based on the static, straightforward nature of the code.",
