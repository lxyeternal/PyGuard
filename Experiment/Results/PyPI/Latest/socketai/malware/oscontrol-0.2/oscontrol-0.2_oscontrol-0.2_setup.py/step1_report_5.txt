  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for packaging the 'oscontrol' Python library.",
  "sources": "User input (setup parameters), find_packages() function (which discovers packages in the directory).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from sources to sinks; setup configuration is static and does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. The code is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata, including name, version, packages, description, author, classifiers, and python_requires. There are no dynamic code executions, external data reads, or suspicious constructs. The use of find_packages() is typical and safe. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
