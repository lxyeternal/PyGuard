  "purpose": "The setup.py script is used to configure and install the 'oscontrol' Python package, specifying its metadata and package contents.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data sources; it only imports modules and defines setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this static setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard setup script without anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package metadata including name, version, packages, description, author, classifiers, and required Python version. All components follow typical packaging practices. No external data inputs, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are present. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are detected.",
