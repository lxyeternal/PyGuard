{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'oscontrol' Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package data via 'find_packages()', package metadata such as name, version, description, author, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; the code does not perform data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "The setup function uses package discovery and metadata variables to prepare package installation; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs observed. The code follows standard setup.py conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py file using setuptools to define a package. It sets package metadata without performing any external data handling, network communication, or executing untrusted code. The use of 'find_packages()' is standard, and no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging Python code. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected.",
