  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'oscontrol' Python library.",
  "sources": "None of the setup parameters read input or external data at runtime; static configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed. Usage of standard setuptools functions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It imports setuptools, defines package metadata such as name, version, description, author, classifiers, and Python version requirements. The code is straightforward, employing typical patterns for package setup without executing any code that could be malicious. There are no indications of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The absence of dynamic code execution or external data processing reduces the likelihood of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a standard, benign package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not process untrusted data nor contains suspicious code segments.",
