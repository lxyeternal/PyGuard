{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up a Python package and execute a specific .exe file during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the executable file 'your_executable.exe' from a subdirectory during the run_exe() function call.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run() executes an external .exe file, which could potentially be malicious if the executable is harmful or tampered with.",
  "flows": "The code flow reads the executable path (source) during run_exe(), then executes it via subprocess.run() (sink) during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Running an external executable during installation is unusual and potentially malicious behavior, especially if the executable is not verified or intentionally hidden. No verification or checksum is performed. The executable's purpose is not clarified, raising suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a function to run an executable located in a subdirectory, and calls this function during the setup process. This behavior is suspicious because executing arbitrary external code during package installation can be exploited to run malicious payloads. The executable is not verified or sandboxed, which increases risk. No other malicious or obfuscated code is present; however, the act of executing an external file at install time is a security concern. This could be used for malicious purposes such as installing backdoors or malware if the executable is compromised or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes an external executable during package installation, which is a significant security concern. Without verification or a legitimate reason, this behavior is suspicious and could facilitate malicious activities. The overall risk is high, and caution is advised if this package is encountered or used.",
