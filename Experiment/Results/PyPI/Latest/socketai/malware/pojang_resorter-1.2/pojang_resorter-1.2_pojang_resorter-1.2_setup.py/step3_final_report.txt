{
  "purpose": "The code executes an external executable ('your_executable.exe') located in the package directory during setup, potentially for installation or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the executable file 'your_executable.exe' from the 'pojang_resorter' directory during setup execution.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run() call executes the external executable, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if the executable is malicious or tampered with.",
  "flows": "The code constructs the executable path, checks for its existence, and then runs it via subprocess.run(), executing external code during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of an external binary during package installation without validation or verification; no integrity checks or signatures are performed; the executable runs automatically during setup import.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a function run_exe() that constructs the path to 'your_executable.exe', checks its existence, and executes it with subprocess.run(). This function is called immediately during script execution, causing the external executable to run during package setup or build. The code does not verify the source, integrity, or authenticity of the executable, which is suspicious. Running external code during setup without validation poses significant security risks, as it can be exploited to execute malicious payloads, backdoors, or system modifications. The pattern is a common tactic for malware delivery, especially if the executable is malicious or compromised. The code itself is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the behavior is inherently risky. The high suspicion is justified by the potential for malicious activity, and the scores reflect this. Without further context or validation, this pattern is considered a serious security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes an external executable during setup without validation, representing a significant security risk. This pattern is suspicious and potentially malicious, as it can be exploited to run arbitrary malicious code. The high malware and security risk scores are justified given the behavior. Unless the executable's purpose and integrity are verified, this practice should be avoided to prevent potential system compromise.",
