{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to run an external executable file during the package installation process, likely as part of setup or post-install steps.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existence of an executable file ('pojang_resorter/your_executable.exe') during the installation process.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run() function executes the specified executable, which could perform any action on the system.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the executable's existence and then runs it directly, establishing a source-to-sink flow from the file check to execution.",
  "anomalies": "Executing an external .exe during package installation is unusual and potentially malicious if the executable performs harmful actions. No code validation or sandboxing is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a function 'run_exe' that locates and executes an external Windows executable. It executes this function immediately during import, which means the executable runs whenever the setup script is invoked. The executable's purpose is unknown; it could perform any actions on the host system. Running arbitrary executables during package installation is highly suspicious and can be exploited to execute malicious code, especially if the executable is replaced or manipulated. No verification or integrity checks are implemented for the executable. The setup process appears standard, but the execution of external code during setup poses a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code runs an external executable during package installation without validation, which is a significant security concern. It could be used maliciously to execute harmful code on the user's system. The behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
