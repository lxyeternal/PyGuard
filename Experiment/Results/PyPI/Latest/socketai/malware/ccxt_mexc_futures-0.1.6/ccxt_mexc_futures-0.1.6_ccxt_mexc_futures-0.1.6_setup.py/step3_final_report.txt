{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python module, defining metadata, dependencies, and classifiers without any dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields: name, version, packages, description, author, author_email, url, install_requires, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed at runtime.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is declarative and does not execute data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and url fields, which are unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration using setuptools, with static metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code, external data, or runtime operations are present. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The empty author and URL fields are minor metadata issues but do not impact security. All dependencies are benign. The overall structure is typical for Python packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly identify it as a safe setup script with no malicious or suspicious features. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is negligible (~0.1 due to incomplete metadata). The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
