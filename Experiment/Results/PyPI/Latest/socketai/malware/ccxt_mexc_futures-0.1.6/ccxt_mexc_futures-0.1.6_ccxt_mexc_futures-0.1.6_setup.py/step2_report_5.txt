  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools.\n- No untrusted data, external inputs, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n- The author and URL fields are empty across reports, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the benign content.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is purely static configuration, with no runtime behavior that could be malicious.\n- No code flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- The package dependencies are common and benign.\n- The absence of author and URL fields is noted but not a security concern.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a score of 0 or 0.1 is reasonable. The highest is 0.1, which seems acceptable.\n\n**Any issues or adjustments?**\n- No, the reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that this is a standard, safe setup script.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical setup.py for packaging a Python project.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to incomplete metadata, but not a security concern)\n\nThis detailed review confirms that the package setup code is safe and free from security issues.",
