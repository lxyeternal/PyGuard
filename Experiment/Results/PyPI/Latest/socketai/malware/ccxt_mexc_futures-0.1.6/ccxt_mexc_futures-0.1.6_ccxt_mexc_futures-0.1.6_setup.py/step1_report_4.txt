{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'ccxt-mexc_futures', used to package and distribute the module via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata and dependencies from the 'setup' function parameters; no external input or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network calls, file writes, or command executions that process untrusted data or potentially leak information.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; the code only defines package metadata and requirements.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code strictly follows standard setup.py conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It lacks any code that reads external data during execution, executes untrusted code, or performs actions that could be malicious. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is straightforward and appears to be a typical packaging script.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is benign and solely used for packaging the Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code.",
