{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for packaging a Python module named 'ccxt-mexc_futures'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata, such as name, version, description, author info, URL, and dependencies. It also uses 'find_packages()' to locate package modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data could be leaked or executed maliciously.",
  "flows": "The source data (package info and dependencies) flow into the setup process, which prepares the package metadata. No untrusted input or external data flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior are present. The code uses standard setup tools without obfuscation or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All data is static, hardcoded, and standard for package distribution. No malicious patterns, external inputs, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration.",
