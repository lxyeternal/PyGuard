{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'ccxt-mexc_futures' that configures package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Code reads package configuration data, such as name, version, packages, description, author info, URL, dependencies, classifiers, and Python version requirements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code only defines static package configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The author and URL fields are empty, which might be a concern for completeness but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata and dependencies without executing any untrusted code or including malicious logic. No source-to-sink data flows are present. The empty author and URL fields are unusual but do not imply malicious intent. The dependencies listed are common and benign. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward setup script with no malicious or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data flows. The package configuration is standard and safe.",
