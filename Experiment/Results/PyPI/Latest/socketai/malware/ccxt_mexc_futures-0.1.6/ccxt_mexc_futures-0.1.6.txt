The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is negligible (~0.1 due to incomplete metadata). The confidence in this assessment is high (1)."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the eval() call on an obfuscated 'salt' string, which could execute malicious code if manipulated. While no active malware or malicious payloads are confirmed, the pattern of obfuscation and dynamic code execution is suspicious and potentially dangerous. The malware score should be increased to reflect this risk, and the overall security risk should be considered high. The code's functionality appears legitimate, but the eval() pattern introduces a significant vulnerability that requires further review or refactoring."
