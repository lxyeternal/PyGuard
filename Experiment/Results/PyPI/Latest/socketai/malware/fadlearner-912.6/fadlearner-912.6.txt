      "conclusion": "The pattern of executing main() during installation is a red flag for supply chain security. While no malicious code is visible, the behavior itself is dangerous and can be exploited. The scores should be high, with malware around 0.75 and security risk around 0.75, reflecting the high potential for malicious activity if main.py is malicious."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious-like behavior through environment data exfiltration to suspicious domains, with no benign purpose. It should be considered highly suspicious or malicious, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated but performs covert data transmission, indicating potential privacy invasion or malware activity."
