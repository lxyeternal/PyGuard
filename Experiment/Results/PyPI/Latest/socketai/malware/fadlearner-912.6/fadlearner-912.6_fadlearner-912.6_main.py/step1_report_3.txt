  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current directory) and a random number flow into URL parameters, which are then transmitted over the network via urllib.request.urlopen()",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple suspicious URLs that appear to be non-standard or malicious domains; sends system information without user consent; employs a random number in URL which could be for tracking or obfuscation; no authentication or encryption evident.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers basic system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory. It generates a random number between 10,000 and 99,999, then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains with embedded parameters. It attempts to send these details via HTTP GET requests to each URL. The URLs and data transmission pattern suggest potential tracking or data exfiltration behavior. No input validation, user prompts, or encryption are present. The domain names and multiple URL destinations raise concerns about malicious intent. The code's purpose appears to be to monitor or leak user system info to external servers.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be designed for malicious or tracking purposes, exfiltrating system details to potentially malicious domains without user consent. Its behavior is suspicious, with no legitimate application evident. It should be treated as potentially malicious.",
