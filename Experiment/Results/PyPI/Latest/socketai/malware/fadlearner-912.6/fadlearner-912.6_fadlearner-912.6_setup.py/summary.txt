  "conclusion": "The pattern of executing main() during installation is a red flag for supply chain security. While no malicious code is visible, the behavior itself is dangerous and can be exploited. The scores should be high, with malware around 0.75 and security risk around 0.75, reflecting the high potential for malicious activity if main.py is malicious."
