  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup command that executes main() from main.py during installation, which can run arbitrary code.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from main import main' and the call to main() in the run() method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() during install, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if main.py contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "The run() method calls 'import main' and then executes 'main()', executing external code during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of main() during setup without safeguards, potentially executing malicious or untrusted code.",
  "analysis": "The code unconditionally executes main() during installation, which is a known security risk pattern. No obfuscation or secrets are present. The pattern can be exploited for supply chain attacks. The scores should reflect high suspicion; malware score around 0.75 and security risk around 0.75 are justified due to the dangerous behavior of executing external code during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The pattern of executing main() during installation is a red flag for supply chain security. While no malicious code is visible, the behavior itself is dangerous and can be exploited. The scores should be high, with malware around 0.75 and security risk around 0.75, reflecting the high potential for malicious activity if main.py is malicious.",
