  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory) is gathered and sent via HTTP GET requests to remote URLs with a random number as part of the URL path",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domains, consistent collection of system info and sending it over network without user consent, use of random number in URL path for obfuscation or tracking",
  "analysis": "The script collects host name, username, and current directory, then generates a random number to append to URLs. It constructs URLs that point to suspicious domains and sends system info via GET requests. The code uses standard libraries but communicates with untrusted, potentially malicious domains. No malicious payloads are executed locally, but the network activity indicates possible data exfiltration or reconnaissance. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation techniques are present, but the behavior is suspicious due to data transmission to known suspicious domains.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be used for covertly collecting and transmitting system information to external servers, which could be malicious or part of a tracking/spyware activity. No explicit malware behavior such as damage or backdoors is evident, but the network communication with suspicious domains is concerning.",
