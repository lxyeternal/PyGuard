  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior indicative of data exfiltration or tracking, with high privacy invasion potential. It does not contain active malicious payloads but warrants caution. Malware score should be moderate (~0.5), and security risk high (~0.8). The behavior aligns with malicious intent, justifying elevated risk assessments."
