  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to remote servers",
  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current directory) collected from sources are encoded into URLs and sent via HTTP GET requests to the specified remote servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domain names, gathering system info, and sending it without user consent; no validation or encryption; hardcoded URLs",
  "analysis": "The script collects system information such as hostname, username, and current directory. It generates a random number to include in URLs. It then constructs HTTP GET requests to three external domains, embedding the collected data as URL parameters. The data is sent unencrypted via GET requests, which could leak sensitive info. The domain names look suspicious and are likely controlled by an attacker or used for tracking. The code lacks any user consent prompts or safeguards. No malicious payload execution is present, but the activity indicates potential privacy invasion or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs benign-looking system info collection but transmits it to potentially malicious or suspicious domains without encryption or user awareness. It resembles tracking or data exfiltration behavior, which warrants security caution.",
