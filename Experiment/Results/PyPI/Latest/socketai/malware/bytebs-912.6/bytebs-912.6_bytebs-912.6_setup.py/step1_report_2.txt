  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration that installs dependencies and runs a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "The import of 'main' inside the custom 'run' method of the CrazyInstallStrat class.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'main()' function imported from 'main', potentially executing arbitrary code during installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, 'install.run(self)' executes, then 'from main import main' loads a module, followed by 'main()' execution.",
  "anomalies": "The custom 'run' method executes code ('main()') from an external module during installation, which is unusual and potentially dangerous.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python package with standard setup parameters. A custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' overrides the 'run' method, which calls the parent 'install.run(self)' and then imports and executes 'main()' from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers code execution at install time, which can be malicious if 'main' contains harmful code or backdoors. No other suspicious or obfuscated code is present. The 'requests' dependency is standard, and no hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a function ('main()') during installation, which could be malicious if 'main' is malicious. This is unusual behavior for a setup script and could be a supply chain attack vector.",
