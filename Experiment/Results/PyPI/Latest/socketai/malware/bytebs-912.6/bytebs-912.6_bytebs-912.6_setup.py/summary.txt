  "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes if 'main()' contains harmful code. The scores are consistent with this behavior, with a malware risk around 0.6 and a high security risk score (~0.7). Vigilance is advised, and such patterns should be avoided unless 'main()' is verified to be safe."
