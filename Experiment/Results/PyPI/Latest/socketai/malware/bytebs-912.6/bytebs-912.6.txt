      "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes if 'main()' contains harmful code. The scores are consistent with this behavior, with a malware risk around 0.6 and a high security risk score (~0.7). Vigilance is advised, and such patterns should be avoided unless 'main()' is verified to be safe."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior indicative of data exfiltration or tracking, with high privacy invasion potential. It does not contain active malicious payloads but warrants caution. Malware score should be moderate (~0.5), and security risk high (~0.8). The behavior aligns with malicious intent, justifying elevated risk assessments."
