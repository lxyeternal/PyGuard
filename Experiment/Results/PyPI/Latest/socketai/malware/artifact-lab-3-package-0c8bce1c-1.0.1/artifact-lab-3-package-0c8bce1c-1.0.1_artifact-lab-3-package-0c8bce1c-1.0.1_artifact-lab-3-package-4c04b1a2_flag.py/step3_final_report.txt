{
  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints 'Hello, World!' with no external data sources or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic function that outputs a static string. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, absence of external data, and lack of suspicious or malicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and behavior. No anomalies or suspicious features are present. The code does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or obfuscation. The assessments are accurate and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent. No further action or modification is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
