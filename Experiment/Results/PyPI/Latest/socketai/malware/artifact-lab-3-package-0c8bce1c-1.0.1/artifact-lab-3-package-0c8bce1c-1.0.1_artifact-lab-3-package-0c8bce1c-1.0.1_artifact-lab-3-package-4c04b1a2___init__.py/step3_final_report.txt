  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, risky patterns, obfuscation, and security vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Use of eval() and exec() functions, hardcoded credentials, network requests, external commands, variable obfuscation, input handling, and data flows within the code.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamic code (`eval()`, `exec()`), network communication, system commands, data leakage points, and environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as untrusted data feeding into eval()/exec(), network calls transmitting data, and external command executions leading to potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() on untrusted input, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, and suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical risky behaviors such as eval() on untrusted data, external network communication, and hardcoded credentials, indicating potential malicious intent. Some reports correctly identify these patterns, assigning moderate malware scores (~0.4-0.6). Others note benign patterns with no suspicious activity, assigning low scores (~0). The inconsistency in obfuscation detection (e.g., Report 3 mentions obfuscated variables but scores 0) should be addressed; if obfuscation is confirmed, the score should be increased. Overall, the scores align with the described behaviors, with higher scores justified by risky functions and network activity. The confidence in these assessments is high, given the explicit mention of risky patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate security risks primarily due to eval()/exec() usage on untrusted input, network activity, and hardcoded secrets. The scores are generally appropriate; however, the obfuscated score in some reports should be adjusted if obfuscation is confirmed. The overall malware score should be around 0.5-0.6, and the security risk around 0.55-0.65, reflecting the identified risks. No evidence suggests definitive malware payloads, but the potential for malicious behavior warrants cautious scoring.",
