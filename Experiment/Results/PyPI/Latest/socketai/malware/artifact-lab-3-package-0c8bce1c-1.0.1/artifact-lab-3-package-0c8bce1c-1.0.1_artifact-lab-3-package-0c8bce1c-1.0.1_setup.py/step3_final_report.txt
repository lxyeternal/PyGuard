  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates environment variables during package installation or development setup by sending them to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ during install and develop commands.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to https://29c2aa2421c8.ngrok.app transmitting encoded environment data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected, URL-encoded, and sent via urllib.request.urlopen during setup commands.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic exfiltration of all environment variables during package install/develop without user consent; use of a temporary ngrok URL.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions that collect all environment variables, encode, and send them to an external server during both install and develop commands. This behavior indicates malicious data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the URL used is suspicious. The behavior is consistent across reports, which correctly identify the malicious intent. Scores assigned (malware 1, risk 1, obfuscation 0) are justified given the clear exfiltration of sensitive data. No logical flaws or misjudgments are evident. The behavior warrants maximum security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious environment variable exfiltration during package setup, representing a high security risk. The high malware and risk scores are justified; the code should be flagged for review or removal before deployment.",
