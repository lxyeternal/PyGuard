{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package that, during installation or development setup, leaks environment variables to an external server.",
  "sources": "The environment variables are read from os.environ in the notmalfunc() function.",
  "sinks": "The environment variable data is URL-encoded and sent via an HTTP POST request to an external URL (https://29c2aa2421c8.ngrok.app).",
  "flows": "Environment variables are fetched, encoded, and transmitted over the network during the run of the custom install or develop commands.",
  "anomalies": "The function notmalfunc() is designed to leak environment variables to an external server during package installation or development, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. Use of ngrok URL suggests potential obfuscation or evasion tactics.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools modules and defines two custom command classes (AfterDevelop and AfterInstall) that override the run() method to execute notmalfunc(). This function retrieves all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to an external URL. The setup() call binds these custom commands to the install and develop commands, ensuring the data leakage occurs during package installation or development setup. The external URL (ngrok) is commonly used to hide malicious activity or for command-and-control communication. Overall, the code intentionally leaks environment data, which could include sensitive information, to an external server, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables during package installation, likely to compromise or spy on the user. The obfuscated external URL and the context of data leakage strongly suggest malicious intent.",
