{
  "purpose": "This package is designed to leak environment variables during installation or development setup by sending them to an external server.",
  "sources": "The environment variables are read from os.environ in the function `notmalfunc()`.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via an HTTP POST request to an external URL ('https://29c2aa2421c8.ngrok.app'), which acts as the sink.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected in `notmalfunc()` and then URL-encoded, then sent over an HTTP request to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The function `notmalfunc()` is invoked automatically during both installation and development setup, which is unusual behavior. The URL used is an ngrok address, often used for tunneling and testing, suggesting potential for remote data collection. The code does not perform any validation or sanitization on environment data before sending.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines custom commands that extend standard install and develop commands. In both custom commands, it calls `notmalfunc()`, which collects all environment variables and sends them to an external URL. This behavior is embedded in the package setup process, making it execute automatically upon installation or development setup. This pattern indicates malicious intent or at least malicious behavior, as it leaks potentially sensitive environment data without user consent. The use of `urllib.request` to transmit data to an external server suggests a potential data exfiltration mechanism. There are no obfuscation techniques used, but the functionality itself is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code intentionally leaks environment variables during package installation or development setup by sending them to an external server, indicating malicious behavior. The approach is straightforward but concealed within the setup process, raising significant security concerns.",
