      "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate security risks primarily due to eval()/exec() usage on untrusted input, network activity, and hardcoded secrets. The scores are generally appropriate; however, the obfuscated score in some reports should be adjusted if obfuscation is confirmed. The overall malware score should be around 0.5-0.6, and the security risk around 0.55-0.65, reflecting the identified risks. No evidence suggests definitive malware payloads, but the potential for malicious behavior warrants cautious scoring."
