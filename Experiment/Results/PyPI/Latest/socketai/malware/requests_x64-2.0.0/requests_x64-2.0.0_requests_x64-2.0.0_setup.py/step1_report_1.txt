{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package and includes a function to download and execute an external executable file from a specified URL.",
  "sources": "The function download_and_run_exe() reads data from the URL 'https://send.tresorit.com/a#oPaBw2_7GrteEiXwSSI29g' via requests.get()",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run() executes the downloaded executable file, potentially running malicious code on the host system.",
  "flows": "The code downloads data from an external URL, writes it to a file, and then executes that file, creating a source-to-sink flow from network input to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes downloading and executing an executable from an untrusted URL without validation or user consent. The URL appears suspicious, and the code runs it directly, which is highly risky.",
  "analysis": "The script includes a function that fetches an executable from a remote server and runs it immediately, which is a common tactic in malware delivery. The URL used is suspicious and does not match standard repository or package management patterns. There is no validation of the downloaded content, and the execution is silent, increasing risk. The setup() call appears typical but is overshadowed by the malicious download and run logic. Overall, the code demonstrates high malicious intent, specifically executing external code from an untrusted source.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable without validation, posing a high security threat. It appears intentionally designed to run potentially harmful code on the host system, indicating malicious intent.",
