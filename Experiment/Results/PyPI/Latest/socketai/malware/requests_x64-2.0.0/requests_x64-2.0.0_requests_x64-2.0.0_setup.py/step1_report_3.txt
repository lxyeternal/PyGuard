{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to define a Python package setup configuration, but it also contains malicious behavior that downloads and executes a potentially harmful executable from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The function download_and_run_exe() downloads data from a remote URL (https://send.tresorit.com/a#oPaBw2_7GrteEiXwSSI29g) and executes it.",
  "sinks": "The response from the URL is written to a file and then executed via subprocess.run(), which runs the downloaded executable on the system.",
  "flows": "The code flows from fetching the URL (source) in download_and_run_exe() to saving it as an executable file and then executing it via subprocess, creating a direct source-to-sink execution path.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes the automatic download and silent execution of an external executable during package setup, which is highly suspicious and atypical for legitimate setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and additional modules such as requests and subprocess. It defines a function download_and_run_exe() that fetches an executable from an external URL, saves it locally, and executes it without user consent or verification. This behavior is embedded within what appears to be a legitimate setup script, likely designed to conceal malicious activity. The download URL appears suspicious, and executing remote code during package installation poses a severe security risk. No other malicious or suspicious code is present beyond this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote executable during setup, which indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent. It can compromise system security and should not be used. The rest of the script appears to be normal package setup code, but the malicious function outweighs this. Overall, this package is unsafe.",
