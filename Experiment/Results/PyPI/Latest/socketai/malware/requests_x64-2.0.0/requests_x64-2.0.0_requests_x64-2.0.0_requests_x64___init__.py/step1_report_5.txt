  "purpose": "Provide wrapper functions for HTTP GET and POST requests using the requests library.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'url', 'data', 'json', and 'kwargs' in get() and post() functions.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() and requests.post() calls that send HTTP requests based on input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (URLs and data) flow into requests.get() and requests.post() calls which generate network traffic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple wrapper functions around the requests library, allowing for HTTP GET and POST requests. It accepts parameters such as URL, data, JSON payload, and additional kwargs, which are directly passed to the requests methods. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and does not include any obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for HTTP requests without any malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.",
