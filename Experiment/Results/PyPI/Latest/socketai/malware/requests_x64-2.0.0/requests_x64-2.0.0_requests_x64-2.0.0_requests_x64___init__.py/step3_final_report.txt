  "purpose": "Wrapper functions for requests.get and requests.post to facilitate HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed directly to requests.get() and requests.post() functions.",
  "sinks": "Network functions sending data to specified URLs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into requests functions, leading to network communication.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward code with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple wrapper functions that invoke the requests library without additional logic. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The functions facilitate network requests, which inherently carry some risk if URLs are malicious, but the code itself is benign. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security flaws. The low security risk score of 0.1 accurately reflects the minimal inherent risk associated with network requests, and the malware score remains at 0. The code's straightforward nature warrants no further concern.",
