  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward wrapper around the `requests` library for HTTP GET and POST requests.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- The functions simply pass parameters directly to the requests functions.\n- The main concern is network communication to potentially untrusted URLs, which is typical for such utility functions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues in the code:\n- The code does **not** contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.\n- The functions are simple wrappers, and there is no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- The code's logic is sound and benign.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- They emphasize that the code is straightforward and does not include obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign `malware` score = 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are low (0.1 or 0.2), which is reasonable given the network communication aspect but no malicious activity.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0 in all reports, consistent with the code clarity.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- The `securityRisk` scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- Since the code involves network requests, there is always some risk if used with malicious URLs, but the code itself is not malicious.\n- No reason exists to assign higher risk scores unless the context indicates malicious use, which is not present here.\n\n### Malware score:\n- All reports assign `malware` = 0, which is justified.\n- No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is benign, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made without evidence.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, mainly due to network communication potential)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since network requests are involved, but no malicious activity)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign utility wrapper with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the context in which this code is used. If deployed in an environment where URLs are untrusted, the risk increases, but the code itself remains benign.",
