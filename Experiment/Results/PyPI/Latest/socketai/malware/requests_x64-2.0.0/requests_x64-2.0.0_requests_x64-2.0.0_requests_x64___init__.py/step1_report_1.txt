  "purpose": "Wrapper functions for sending HTTP GET and POST requests using the requests library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'url', 'data', 'json', and '**kwargs' for requests.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() and requests.post() functions potentially sending data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed directly to requests methods, which then send data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual patterns or code manipulation. The functions are straightforward wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple wrapper functions around the 'requests' library's get and post methods. There is no data processing, no dynamic code execution, nor handling of sensitive data within the functions. The functions accept parameters and pass them directly to requests. No suspicious logic, data exfiltration, or malicious activity is evident. The code appears to be a standard utility for HTTP requests without any malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides basic request wrapper functions with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is standard and benign.",
