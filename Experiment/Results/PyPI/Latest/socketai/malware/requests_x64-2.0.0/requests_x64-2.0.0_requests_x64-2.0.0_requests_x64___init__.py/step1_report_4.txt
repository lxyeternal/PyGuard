  "purpose": "Wrapper functions for sending HTTP GET and POST requests using the requests library.",
  "sources": "User-provided URL input as function parameters in get() and post().",
  "targets": "The requests.get() and requests.post() functions which send HTTP requests to specified URLs.",
  "flows": "Input URLs from parameters flow into requests.get() and requests.post() functions, leading to network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious URL handling, and no unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple wrapper functions for the requests library's get and post methods. It accepts URLs and optional parameters, then calls the respective requests functions to perform network requests. There is no evident data leakage, input validation, or suspicious behavior. The code does not perform any data processing, storage, or network communication beyond the standard requests call, and does not handle or log untrusted data in a suspicious manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard request wrappers with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply facilitates HTTP requests using the requests library, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
