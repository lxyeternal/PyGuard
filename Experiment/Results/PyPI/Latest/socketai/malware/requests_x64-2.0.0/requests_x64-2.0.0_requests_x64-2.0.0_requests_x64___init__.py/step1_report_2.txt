{
  "purpose": "Provides simple wrapper functions for sending HTTP GET and POST requests using the requests library.",
  "sources": "User input parameters for URL, data, json, and additional kwargs passed to requests.get() and requests.post().",
  "sinks": "requests.get() and requests.post() functions, which send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into requests.get() and requests.post(), leading to network transmission of data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Functions are straightforward wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions, get() and post(), that wrap requests library calls. They accept URL parameters and optional data payloads, then perform network requests. No malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. There is no handling of untrusted input beyond passing parameters directly to requests functions, which is standard. The code does not include any obfuscated code, credential leaks, or suspicious network communication patterns beyond legitimate HTTP requests.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign wrapper around the requests library's get and post methods, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
