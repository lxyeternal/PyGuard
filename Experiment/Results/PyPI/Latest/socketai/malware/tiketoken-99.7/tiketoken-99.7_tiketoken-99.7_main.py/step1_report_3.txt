  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, possibly for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd() - reading system hostname, username, and current directory.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() - sending data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, username, current_path, random number) flows into URL parameters, which are then transmitted over network requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious URLs that resemble command-and-control or malicious domains; no clear legitimate purpose for this data collection. The code sends system info to these URLs without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers basic system info: hostname, username, current directory, and generates a random number. It constructs URLs with these parameters and makes HTTP requests to potentially malicious or suspicious domains. The URLs are obfuscated in appearance, possibly indicating malicious intent. The code does not handle responses meaningfully, and the URLs used are suspicious, suggesting potential data exfiltration or tracking. There is no user interaction or clear legitimate purpose. No malicious payload execution or backdoors are detected, but the behavior resembles a tracking or data theft activity.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be collecting system information and transmitting it to suspicious external servers, indicating potential malicious intent, such as user tracking or data exfiltration. No overt malware behavior like system modification or backdoors is detected, but the data transmission to suspicious domains raises security concerns.",
