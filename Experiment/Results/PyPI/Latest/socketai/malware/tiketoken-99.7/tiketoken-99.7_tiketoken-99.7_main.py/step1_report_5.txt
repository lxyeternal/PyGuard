  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to remote servers via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node() for hostname, getpass.getuser() for username, os.getcwd() for current directory, random.randint() for a random number, and the URLs in the list for remote servers.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() for sending HTTP requests to external servers with embedded parameters.",
  "flows": "System info and random number generated in the script are embedded as URL parameters and sent to each remote URL via HTTP GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, sending system information to external servers, and the use of a random number for URL differentiation. No obfuscated code or hidden logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code collects basic system info: hostname, username, current directory. It generates a random number to possibly differentiate requests. The URLs are suspicious and point to potentially malicious or tracking domains. It constructs URLs with embedded system info and sends GET requests to these domains, possibly for tracking or data collection purposes. The try-except block ensures the requests are attempted silently. No malicious code execution, code injection, or backdoors are present; however, the pattern of data exfiltration to untrusted servers is suspicious and typical in tracking or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system information and sends it to external suspicious domains without user consent, indicating potential data exfiltration or tracking behavior. No signs of malware such as damaging actions or reverse shells are present, but the behavior is suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes.",
