  "anomalies": "Usage of hardcoded suspicious URLs with non-standard domains; sending system info to these URLs; no clear legitimate purpose for data collection; no user consent or transparency",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current working directory, and a random number, then constructs URLs to send this data via GET requests. The URLs are obscure and potentially malicious domains. The code does not perform any validation or user consent, indicating possible tracking or data leakage. The data transmission occurs over HTTP, which is insecure. No other malicious activities are evident, but the behavior strongly suggests tracking or exfiltration. The use of try-except blocks handles potential network errors gracefully but does not mitigate the underlying risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely malicious or at least suspicious, designed to send user and system information to remote servers without user awareness. The suspicious URLs and data exfiltration pattern indicate a potential security risk.",
