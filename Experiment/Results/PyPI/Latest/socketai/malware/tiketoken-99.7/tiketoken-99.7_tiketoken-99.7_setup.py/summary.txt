  "conclusion": "The code executes external code during setup, posing a significant security risk. The pattern is suspicious and should be reviewed thoroughly. The current scores are appropriate but conservative; higher scores could be justified if 'main.py' is untrusted or malicious. Overall, this pattern is a supply chain vulnerability that warrants caution."
