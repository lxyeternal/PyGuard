{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'tiketoken' Python package, including a custom installation command that executes a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and executes 'main()' from main.py during installation.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' from main.py acts as a sink, potentially executing arbitrary code during installation.",
  "flows": "During 'install', the custom 'run' method executes 'main()' from main.py, which could contain any code, including malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes 'main()' post-install without any apparent validation or restrictions. No other suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package with a custom install class that overrides 'run' to call 'main()' from main.py. This behavior is unusual because executing arbitrary code during package installation can be exploited for malicious purposes. If 'main.py' contains malicious code, it will be executed at install time. The rest of the setup code appears standard, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious dependencies. The use of 'requests' as a dependency alone is not suspicious, but the invocation of 'main()' warrants attention since its contents are unknown.",
  "conclusion": "The main concern is the execution of 'main()' during installation, which could contain malicious code. Without inspecting 'main.py', this behavior introduces a security risk. The package could be used to execute arbitrary code upon installation, which is potentially malicious.",
