{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines a Python package 'tiketoken' and executes the 'main()' function from 'main.py' during installation, which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from main import main' within the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during setup, which can run any code contained in 'main.py'.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code flow is: run() -> import main -> main() execution.",
  "anomalies": "Executing external code ('main()') during setup without validation, which is unconventional and risky; no validation or sandboxing present.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces a security concern by executing 'main()' from 'main.py' during package installation. This pattern can be exploited if 'main.py' contains malicious code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the target system. The pattern is a known supply chain risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.3-0.5, security risk 0.4-0.6) are reasonable given the behavior, but the actual maliciousness depends on the contents of 'main.py'. The pattern warrants caution and further inspection of 'main.py' before deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes external code during setup, posing a significant security risk. The pattern is suspicious and should be reviewed thoroughly. The current scores are appropriate but conservative; higher scores could be justified if 'main.py' is untrusted or malicious. Overall, this pattern is a supply chain vulnerability that warrants caution.",
