{
  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for the 'tiketoken' Python package, including a custom installation command that executes code from 'main.py' upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules, and during installation, it imports 'main' from 'main.py' and executes 'main()'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during the install process could lead to arbitrary code execution if 'main.py' contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "The install process (source) triggers the import and execution of 'main()' (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Custom install command runs code ('main()') immediately after installation, which is unusual and potentially dangerous. No input validation or environment checks are present before executing 'main()'.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python package with standard metadata and dependencies. It defines a custom install class that, after running the normal installation process, imports and executes a function 'main' from 'main.py'. This behavior is uncommon and risky because it allows arbitrary code execution at install time. No indication of malicious intent is evident outside this execution pattern, but executing code from 'main.py' without safeguards introduces security concerns. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or obfuscated elements, but the act of executing external code at install time is a potential security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the execution of 'main()' during installation, which could be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code. This pattern is suspicious and should be reviewed carefully before deployment.",
