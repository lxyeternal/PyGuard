  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static string, serving as a benign test or placeholder.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data reads, or data flows; static code with no data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function simply returns a string without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single, static function with no external dependencies, inputs, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence scores are full (1), reflecting certainty. No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious actions are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify the low risk assessment. The scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate and consistent. The final assessment confirms a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
