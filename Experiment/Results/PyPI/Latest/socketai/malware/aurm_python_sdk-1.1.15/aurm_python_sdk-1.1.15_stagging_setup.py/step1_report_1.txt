{
  "purpose": "To customize the installation process by fetching remote data and modifying user shell configuration files during package installation.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen to fetch remote data; file reads from ~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile; open('README.md') for long description",
  "sinks": "Writing fetched data into ~/.fleetwood.py; appending commands into ~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile",
  "flows": "Remote URL fetch -> write to ~/.fleetwood.py; check and append command to ~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile",
  "anomalies": "Fetching remote data during package install and writing it into a hidden file; appending commands to user shell configuration files without validation; suppressing exceptions broadly; no validation or security checks for fetched content",
  "analysis": "The code fetches a file from an external URL during installation and saves it to a hidden file in the user's home directory. It then attempts to add a command to execute this script in shell configuration files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile), potentially enabling persistent execution. All network activity and file modifications happen without user consent or validation, which can be exploited for malicious purposes. The exception handling is overly broad, hiding potential errors, and the code does not verify the fetched content. These behaviors resemble malicious activities like remote command execution setup or persistent backdoors. There are no indications of obfuscation, but the intent to automatically run external code is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates potentially malicious behavior by fetching external data and automatically modifying user shell configs to execute this data, which can lead to persistent, unauthorized execution of remote code. This is highly suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes such as backdoor installation or system compromise.",
