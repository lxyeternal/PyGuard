  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to fetch a remote resource and modify user shell configuration files for persistent commands.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen() fetching remote URL, open() reading/writing local files (~/.fleetwood.py, ~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile)",
  "sinks": "Writing fetched data to ~/.fleetwood.py, appending commands to ~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile",
  "flows": "Remote URL -> downloaded content written to ~/.fleetwood.py -> command string appended to shell config files",
  "anomalies": "Fetching external resource during installation, writing to user configuration files, potentially executing or sourcing malicious code indirectly via ~/.fleetwood.py",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to fetch a remote script from a specified URL, save it to a hidden file, and modify shell startup files to include a command to run that script. This behavior could enable persistent execution of remote code. The remote URL is hardcoded and the code silently ignores exceptions, which prevents detection of errors or failures. The modification of user shell files to source this script suggests persistence or execution on shell startup. No explicit malware actions like network exfiltration or privilege escalation are present, but the remote code fetch and persistence mechanisms pose significant security risks, especially if the remote content is malicious. The code does not obfuscate or use uncommon language features but performs potentially malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code fetches and saves remote content and modifies user shell configuration files to run that content, indicating a high security risk. The behavior resembles a potential backdoor or persistence mechanism, with no transparency or validation of the fetched content. Overall, it poses a significant threat and should be considered malicious.",
