{
  "purpose": "The code fetches remote data from a specified URL, saves it as ~/.fleetwood.py, and appends a command to execute this script in user shell configuration files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) during package installation, enabling persistent remote code execution.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen to fetch remote content; open() to write to ~/.fleetwood.py; open() to append commands to ~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'python ~/.fleetwood.py' via shell configuration files; potential for remote code execution and persistence",
  "flows": "Remote URL fetch -> save to ~/.fleetwood.py -> append 'python ~/.fleetwood.py' to shell configs -> shell startup executes remote code",
  "anomalies": "Unvalidated remote code fetch; silent broad exception handling; modification of user environment files without user consent; no integrity checks or authentication",
  "analysis": "The code performs a remote fetch of potentially malicious content, writes it to a hidden file, and modifies user shell configuration files to execute this code automatically at shell startup. It suppresses errors broadly, masking failures that could indicate malicious activity. The behavior aligns with typical backdoor or persistent malware tactics, enabling remote code execution without user awareness. The remote URL is hardcoded and untrusted, and no validation is performed on the fetched content. The straightforward implementation and persistent setup indicate high malicious potential. Scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9, obfuscated 0) are justified given these behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk malicious behavior by fetching and executing remote code during installation, modifying user environment files for persistence, and lacking validation or user consent. The high malware and security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior.",
