{
  "purpose": "This file initializes the tests package by importing a test function from module1 for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "The code imports a function from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs a simple import and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py file typical of Python packages, used to set the public API of the package. It imports a specific function from a sibling module and exposes it via __all__, with no data processing, input handling, or external communication. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and standard for Python package initialization. There are no indicators of malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation.",
