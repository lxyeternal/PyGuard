  "purpose": "This code initializes the tests package by importing test_function from module1 for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports test_function from a local module within the tests package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output points present.",
  "flows": "Import statement brings test_function into the namespace, but no data flow analysis is applicable as there are no runtime data processing or external data inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward package initialization code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package init file that imports a function from a sibling module and declares it as part of the package's public API. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. It only defines the package's public interface.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing standard package initialization without any malicious intent or security issues.",
