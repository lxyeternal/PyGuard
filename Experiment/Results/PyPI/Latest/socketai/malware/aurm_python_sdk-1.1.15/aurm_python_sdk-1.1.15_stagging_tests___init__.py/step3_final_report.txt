{
  "purpose": "Standard package initialization importing test_function from module1 and exposing it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .module1, assignment to __all__",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external calls, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Import from .module1 to __all__ assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export pattern, no obfuscation or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py file that imports a function from a sibling module and declares it in __all__. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The only minor discrepancy is in report 4, which assigns a securityRisk score of 0.1 despite no actual security concern; this can be considered an overestimation. Overall, the code is standard, safe, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores across reports should all be set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk for consistency and accuracy.",
