{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'run' from a module named 'main' within the same package, likely intended to execute the main functionality of the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.main), which may execute code during import if 'main' runs any code at import time.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified in this snippet; the code itself does not perform any data processing or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible; the code only performs an import operation without further execution.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is a simple import statement. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a local module. There is no execution of code, no data processing, and no external interactions shown. Given the simplicity, it does not raise immediate suspicion. However, if 'main' contains malicious code that executes upon import, it could pose a risk. Without examining 'main', the risk cannot be fully assessed. Still, based solely on this snippet, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement with no apparent malicious intent. Potential risks depend on the contents of the 'main' module, which are not visible here. Overall, the code is benign in isolation.",
