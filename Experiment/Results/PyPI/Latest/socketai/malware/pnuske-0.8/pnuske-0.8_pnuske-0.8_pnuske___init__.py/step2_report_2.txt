  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement: `from .main import run`.\n   - No additional code, data processing, or external interactions are present in the snippet.\n   - The import statement itself is standard in Python projects and does not inherently pose security risks.\n\n2. **Potential Risks & Anomalies**:\n   - The only concern raised is whether the 'main' module contains malicious code that executes upon import. However, since the snippet is only an import statement, no malicious behavior can be confirmed without inspecting 'main'.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected in the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the minimal code and lack of evidence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 in some reports, likely reflecting minor concern about potential malicious code in 'main'. Given only this snippet, a score of 0 seems more justified, unless there is prior knowledge of malicious 'main' code.\n\n4. **Assessment of Report Reasoning & Scores**:\n   - The reports generally recognize the simplicity of the code and correctly identify that no malicious behavior is evident in this snippet.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is appropriate given the minimal code.\n   - The security risk scores are somewhat inflated in some reports (up to 0.2) considering the snippet alone. Without evidence, a score of 0 would be more consistent.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation & Recommendations**:\n   - The code is benign in isolation.\n   - The potential risk depends entirely on the contents of 'main', which are not visible here.\n   - The scores should reflect the absence of malicious activity in this snippet, so malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n   - The security risk score should also be 0 unless there is external context indicating malicious behavior in 'main'.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious activity or security issues. The current scores overstate potential risks; they should be adjusted downward to reflect the benign nature of this isolated code.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: Any actual security concern hinges on the contents of the 'main' module, which is outside the scope of this snippet. For a comprehensive assessment, reviewing 'main' would be necessary.",
