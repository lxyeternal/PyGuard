  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code imports a function from a relative module; no input or external data is read directly in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows are evident in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a function from a local module named 'main'. It does not perform any actions by itself and does not contain any security-sensitive operations. Since it is a simple import statement, there are no apparent malicious behaviors or anomalies. It is typical of modular Python code organization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as an import statement for modular code. No malicious behavior, security issues, or anomalies are detected in this snippet.",
