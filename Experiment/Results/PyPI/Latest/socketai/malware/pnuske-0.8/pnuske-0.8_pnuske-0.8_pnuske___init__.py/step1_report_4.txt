  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a relative module 'main'. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no sinks that handle untrusted data. Without additional context or code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The snippet is a simple import statement that is common in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger module and does not introduce any risks by itself.",
