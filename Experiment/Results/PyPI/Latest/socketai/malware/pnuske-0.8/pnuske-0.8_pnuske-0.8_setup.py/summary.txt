  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, safe configuration for packaging a Python project. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the implementation of the 'pnuske:run' function, which is not provided. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 accurately reflect the code's benign nature."
