  "purpose": "Configure package metadata, find packages, and define a command-line entry point for the 'pnuske' package.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including 'name', 'version', 'packages', and 'entry_points'.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of 'pnuske:run' when the 'pnuske' command is executed.",
  "flows": "User runs 'pnuske' command -> triggers 'pnuske:run' function in the package.",
  "anomalies": "None detected in the setup script; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports 'setuptools', defines package metadata, dynamically finds packages, and specifies an entry point 'pnuske=pnuske:run'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling within this script. The actual behavior depends on the implementation of 'pnuske:run', which is outside the scope of this code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate, as the setup script itself is benign. The potential risk arises only if 'pnuske:run' contains malicious code, but this cannot be assessed here.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, safe configuration for packaging a Python project. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the implementation of the 'pnuske:run' function, which is not provided. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 accurately reflect the code's benign nature.",
