{
  "purpose": "The setup script executes a custom install class that, after completing standard installation, imports and runs the 'main()' function from a local module, potentially executing arbitrary code during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input during the import of 'main' and execution of 'main()' in the 'run()' method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function, executed during setup, acts as a sink where arbitrary code can run, potentially leading to malicious actions or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Input data (the execution flow) starts at the 'run()' method, proceeds to import 'main', and then executes 'main()', which could contain malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The code runs external code ('main()') during installation, which is an unusual and risky pattern not typical for setup scripts; no validation or sandboxing is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes 'main()' from a local module. This pattern introduces a significant security risk, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets, but the behavior itself is inherently dangerous. Multiple reports correctly identify this pattern, with varying severity scores. Given the potential for malicious payloads in 'main()', the risk of executing untrusted code during setup warrants a high malware score. The scores across reports range from moderate to very high, but considering the pattern, a malware score of approximately 0.7 and a security risk score of about 0.8 are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script executes external code ('main()') during installation, which poses a high security risk and potential for malicious activity. Without validation or safeguards, this pattern can be exploited for malicious purposes. The overall assessment indicates a high probability of malicious behavior if 'main.py' is compromised, warranting caution and further review of the 'main' module. The scores should reflect this high threat level.",
