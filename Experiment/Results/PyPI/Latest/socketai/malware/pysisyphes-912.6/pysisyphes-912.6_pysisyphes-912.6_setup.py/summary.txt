  "conclusion": "The setup script executes external code ('main()') during installation, which poses a high security risk and potential for malicious activity. Without validation or safeguards, this pattern can be exploited for malicious purposes. The overall assessment indicates a high probability of malicious behavior if 'main.py' is compromised, warranting caution and further review of the 'main' module. The scores should reflect this high threat level."
