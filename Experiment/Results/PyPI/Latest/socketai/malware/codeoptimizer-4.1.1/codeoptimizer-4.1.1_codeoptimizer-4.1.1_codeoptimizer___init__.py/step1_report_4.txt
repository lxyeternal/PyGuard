  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a specific task or functionality, but without further details, the exact goal cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown; however, the code may read data from environment variables, files, or network inputs depending on the full context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, or data storage points where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks possibly through variables or functions; detailed flow analysis requires specific code lines.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, or obfuscated code are detected in the visible portion. Absence of the actual code limits thorough detection.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited due to the lack of provided code. No suspicious patterns, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident from the available information. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity is observable. Usage of third-party libraries, if present, appears normal. The structure does not show signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of actual code content, there are no detectable malicious behaviors or significant security risks identified. The code appears benign, but a detailed review of the actual code snippets is necessary for a definitive assessment.",
