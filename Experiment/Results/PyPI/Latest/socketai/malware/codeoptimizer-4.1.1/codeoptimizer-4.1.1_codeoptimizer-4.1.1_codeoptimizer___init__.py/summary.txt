  "obfuscated": 0.6,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are generally appropriate and consistent with their analyses. High suspicion in report 1 and 5 is justified by obfuscation and dangerous code practices. Benign assessments in reports 2 and 4 are supported by lack of suspicious features. Moderate suspicion in report 3 reflects cautious concern without definitive malicious code. Overall, the combined estimated scores—malware around 0.7, obfuscation around 0.6, and risk around 0.55—are justified, indicating a moderate to high threat level requiring further investigation if code details are available."
