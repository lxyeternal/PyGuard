      "conclusion": "The reports' scores are generally appropriate and consistent with their analyses. High suspicion in report 1 and 5 is justified by obfuscation and dangerous code practices. Benign assessments in reports 2 and 4 are supported by lack of suspicious features. Moderate suspicion in report 3 reflects cautious concern without definitive malicious code. Overall, the combined estimated scores—malware around 0.7, obfuscation around 0.6, and risk around 0.55—are justified, indicating a moderate to high threat level requiring further investigation if code details are available."

      "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a full-featured remote access trojan capable of exfiltrating sensitive data, executing commands, and controlling the host system. Its capabilities and design justify assigning a malware score of 1.0 and a security risk score of 1.0. The code is not obfuscated, and its malicious intent is clear."
