{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a remote administration tool (RAT) designed to control and extract data from the infected device, including system info, browser passwords, cookies, files, and screen recordings, via Telegram commands.",
  "sources": "User input via Telegram commands and callback data; system commands executed via subprocess; reading local browser data files; capturing screenshots and recording the screen.",
  "sinks": "Sending data through Telegram messages, photos, videos, documents; executing system commands that can disclose sensitive system information; decrypting and extracting stored browser credentials and cookies; reading local files such as passwords, cookies, and system files.",
  "flows": "Input from Telegram commands (sources) triggers functions that execute system commands or read sensitive data (sinks), with some functions decrypting stored credentials or cookies and then sending results back through Telegram, forming a data exfiltration flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains functions that extract stored WiFi passwords, browser passwords, cookies, and system information without user consent, which is suspicious. It includes full remote control capabilities such as file browsing, command execution, screen recording, and system shutdown/restart. The bot token and user ID are hardcoded, which is a security concern. Usage of Windows-specific modules like win32crypt and Cryptodome indicates targeted malicious intent on Windows platforms. No authentication or safeguards prevent misuse. The code operates stealthily by reading browser data and system info and sending it over Telegram, typical for malware.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed as a malicious remote access tool with capabilities for system reconnaissance, data theft, and remote control. It leverages Telegram for command and data transfer, uses system commands and local files to extract sensitive information such as WiFi passwords, browser passwords, and cookies, and includes functionalities for screen recording and file browsing. The presence of hardcoded credentials (Telegram bot token and user ID), system info gathering, and data exfiltration mechanisms strongly suggest malicious intent. It targets Windows but also includes Linux support for some features. No benign purpose or safeguards are evident. Overall, the code exhibits high malicious behavior potential.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code functions as a malicious remote access trojan (RAT) that exfiltrates sensitive data, controls the infected system, and communicates via Telegram. It is designed for unauthorized surveillance and data theft, with high confidence in malicious intent and significant security risks.",
