      "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is inherently risky and potentially malicious. While the actual maliciousness depends on 'main()' contents, the pattern itself warrants a high suspicion level. The scores should reflect this, with a malware score of approximately 0.6 and a security risk score around 0.75. This pattern should be flagged for further review to prevent supply chain attacks."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating high malicious potential and security risk. It does not contain payloads or obfuscation but exhibits behaviors typical of tracking or exfiltration scripts. The activity warrants high security concern, with a malware score around 0.8 and risk score around 0.85, and no obfuscation detected."
