  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'shadowkw' Python package with a custom install step that executes a function from 'main'.",
  "sources": "The custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' which imports and executes 'main' from 'main' during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during install process, which could perform arbitrary actions depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method calls 'main()' from 'main', potentially executing code from an external module.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of a custom install command to execute 'main()' during setup, which can be a vector for executing arbitrary code upon package installation.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that inherits from 'install'. During the run method, it calls 'install.run(self)' to perform standard installation, then imports and executes 'main' from a local module 'main'. This behavior means that whenever the package is installed via setup.py, the 'main()' function in 'main' is automatically executed, which could contain malicious or unwanted behavior. The package dependencies are minimal and standard, with 'requests' specified as an install requirement. The code does not include any obfuscation or suspicious code patterns outside of this custom execution step.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs a non-standard, potentially malicious pattern by executing 'main()' during package installation. This could lead to arbitrary code execution at install time, posing a security risk. The overall risk depends on what 'main()' does, but the pattern itself is suspicious and warrants caution.",
