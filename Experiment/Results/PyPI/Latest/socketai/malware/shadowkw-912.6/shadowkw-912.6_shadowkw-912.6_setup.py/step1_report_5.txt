{
  "purpose": "Set up and install the 'shadowkw' package with a custom installation step that executes the 'main' function from the 'main' module post-installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'setup' and 'install' from setuptools; the custom 'run' method imports 'main' from 'main' module during installation.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function from the 'main' module is executed during installation, which could potentially contain malicious or undesired behavior.",
  "flows": "The installation process calls 'CrazyInstallStrat.run', which in turn imports and executes 'main()' from 'main' module during setup.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes an external function ('main') during setup, which is unusual and potentially risky. No visible hardcoded credentials or malicious code here, but executing code during install is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the 'run' method to execute 'main()' from an imported module during setup. This behavior can be exploited if 'main' contains malicious code, as it runs arbitrary code at install time. The rest of the setup configuration appears standard, with no other suspicious patterns. The dynamic execution of 'main()' during installation is the primary concern, as it can be used to execute malicious actions without explicit user awareness. The code does not include obfuscation or hidden code, but the act of running arbitrary code during setup raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes an external 'main()' function during package installation, which could be malicious or harmful depending on its contents. This behavior is potentially dangerous and should be reviewed carefully, especially the 'main' module's code. Overall, the package exhibits suspicious behavior by executing arbitrary code at install time.",
