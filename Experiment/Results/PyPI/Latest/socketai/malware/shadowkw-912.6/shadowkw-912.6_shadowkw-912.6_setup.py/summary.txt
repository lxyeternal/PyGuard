  "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is inherently risky and potentially malicious. While the actual maliciousness depends on 'main()' contents, the pattern itself warrants a high suspicion level. The scores should reflect this, with a malware score of approximately 0.6 and a security risk score around 0.75. This pattern should be flagged for further review to prevent supply chain attacks."
