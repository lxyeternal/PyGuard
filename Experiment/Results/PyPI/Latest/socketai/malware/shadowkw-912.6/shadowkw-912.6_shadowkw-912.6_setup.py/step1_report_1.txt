  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'shadowkw', including custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'main' from the 'main' module during installation in the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function upon installation; potential execution of arbitrary code if 'main' contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method executes, calling 'main()' from the 'main' module, which may execute arbitrary code at install time.",
  "anomalies": "Custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' executes code ('main()') during installation, which is uncommon and potentially suspicious. No validation or conditions around 'main()' execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation command that, after running the standard install process, imports and executes the 'main' function from the 'main' module. This behavior could be malicious if 'main' contains harmful code, as it executes during package installation. The package metadata appears benign. The code structure is straightforward but the execution of 'main()' during install is unusual and could be exploited to run malicious code on target systems. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected, but the install-time execution of arbitrary code is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code's main concern is executing 'main()' during installation, which could be malicious if 'main' is malicious. This pattern is often used for malicious purposes, such as executing unauthorized code or establishing backdoors at install time. Caution is advised if this package is used or installed, especially without verifying the 'main' module's contents.",
