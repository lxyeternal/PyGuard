  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, possibly for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests with collected data to external URLs via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Data from system information sources is embedded into URL parameters and sent via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The code contacts multiple external URLs with obfuscated subdomains and uses a random number in the URL, which may be for tracking or bypassing detection. The URLs seem suspicious and may be part of a C2 or data collection network. Usage of urllib.request.urlopen for data exfiltration without user consent is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system hostname, username, current directory, and a random number. It constructs URLs pointing to potentially malicious domains and sends these data as URL parameters via HTTP GET requests. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely used for tracking or data exfiltration. The use of random numbers and multiple obfuscated domains indicates intent to avoid detection. No malicious payloads like code execution, file manipulation, or reverse shells are present, but the network activity and data collection are concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be collecting system data and transmitting it to external domains, which could be used for malicious tracking or exfiltration. It does not contain obvious malicious payloads but exhibits behaviors typical of data harvesting scripts with suspicious network endpoints. The activity warrants caution and further investigation.",
