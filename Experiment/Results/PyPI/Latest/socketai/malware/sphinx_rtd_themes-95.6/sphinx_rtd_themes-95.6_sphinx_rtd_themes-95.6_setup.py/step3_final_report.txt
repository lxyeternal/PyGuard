  "purpose": "The setup script defines a custom installation process that executes main() from main.py during package installation, which could run arbitrary code.",
  "sources": "The run() method in CrazyInstallStrat calls import main from main.py after standard install execution.",
  "sinks": "The call to main() during install acts as a sink where untrusted code can execute.",
  "flows": "Installation process -> execution of main() from main.py",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external code (main()) during setup without validation or sandboxing.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to run main() from main.py after the standard installation. This pattern is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution at install time, which could be malicious if main.py contains harmful code. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. The risk depends on the trustworthiness of main.py; without inspection, it presents a security concern. The existing reports correctly identify the suspicious pattern, but their malware scores are generally conservative. Given the behavior, the potential for malicious payloads is high, warranting a higher malware and security risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes external code during installation without validation, posing a significant security risk. While not inherently malicious, this pattern is dangerous if main.py is untrusted. The malware score should be increased to reflect this risk, and the overall security risk is high. The pattern is a common vector for supply chain attacks, and caution is advised when installing such packages.",
