  "conclusion": "The code executes external code during installation without validation, posing a significant security risk. While not inherently malicious, this pattern is dangerous if main.py is untrusted. The malware score should be increased to reflect this risk, and the overall security risk is high. The pattern is a common vector for supply chain attacks, and caution is advised when installing such packages."
