      "conclusion": "The code executes external code during installation without validation, posing a significant security risk. While not inherently malicious, this pattern is dangerous if main.py is untrusted. The malware score should be increased to reflect this risk, and the overall security risk is high. The pattern is a common vector for supply chain attacks, and caution is advised when installing such packages."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a host fingerprinting and potential exfiltration tool, collecting system info and transmitting it to suspicious domains silently. While it does not execute malicious payloads, its behavior is suspicious and could be malicious depending on context. The scores should reflect moderate malware suspicion (~0.4-0.45), no obfuscation (0), and high security risk (~0.75). The overall assessment indicates a privacy-invasive script with exfiltration activity warranting caution."
