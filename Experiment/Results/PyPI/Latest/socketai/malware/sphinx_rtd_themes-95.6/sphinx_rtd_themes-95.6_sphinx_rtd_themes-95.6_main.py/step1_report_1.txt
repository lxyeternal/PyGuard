{
  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which executes system commands to retrieve MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send HTTP requests with encoded system data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info and MAC addresses) are encoded and included as URL parameters in HTTP GET requests sent to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The code encodes MAC addresses in base64 and sends data to suspicious, non-standard domains. The use of multiple external URLs and the specific naming pattern of URLs suggests potentially malicious C2 or data exfiltration behavior. No user input is directly used, but system info is collected and transmitted.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers host-related data (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) and encodes the MAC addresses in base64. It constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends system info via GET requests. The data collection itself is straightforward but the external domains appear potentially malicious or for tracking purposes. The data flow involves encoding system info and transmitting it via URL parameters to these external domains. The script does not perform any harmful actions like executing code, modifying files, or connecting to malicious servers beyond data exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. Overall, the code appears to be a data collection or fingerprinting tool potentially used for malicious surveillance or tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a system fingerprinting and data exfiltration script targeting suspicious domains. It encodes MAC addresses and transmits host info via HTTP GET requests, which could be used for malicious tracking or reconnaissance. No other malicious behaviors such as code execution or data theft are evident. The suspicious domains and data collection pattern suggest possible malicious intent.",
