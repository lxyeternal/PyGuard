  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code in reports 2 and 3 demonstrates behaviors consistent with malicious intent, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and suspicious network activity, warranting higher malware and risk scores. Reports 1, 4, and 5 are benign or lack sufficient evidence for concern. The scores are justified and aligned with the described patterns, with recommendations to review actual code for confirmation and monitor for suspicious behaviors in deployment environments."
