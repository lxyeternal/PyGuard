  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a single `print(\"It Works\")` statement.\n   - There are no inputs, external data, or complex logic involved.\n   - The code's purpose is to output a static message, which all reports agree is benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The summaries correctly identify the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - The reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is justified.\n   - No reason exists to elevate the risk score because there are no inputs, no external dependencies, no suspicious behaviors, and no malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This is correct, as the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports are cautious and based on observable facts.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The uniformity across reports supports their accuracy.\n\n**Overall Assessment and Recommendations**:\n\n- **Estimated Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Estimated Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Estimated Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n\n**Final Conclusion**:\nThe code is entirely benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code performs a simple print operation.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are present.\n- All scores correctly reflect the benign nature of the script.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\nMaintain the current scoring and conclude that this code poses no security concern.",
