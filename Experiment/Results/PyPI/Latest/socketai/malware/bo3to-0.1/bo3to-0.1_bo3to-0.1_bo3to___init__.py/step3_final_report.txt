  "purpose": "A simple Python script that outputs a static message.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static output only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a print statement with no inputs, data processing, or external dependencies. It does not perform any dynamic or suspicious operations. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no malicious intent or security risks. No obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's behavior is benign, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a trivial, harmless script with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and no modifications or higher risk scores are warranted.",
