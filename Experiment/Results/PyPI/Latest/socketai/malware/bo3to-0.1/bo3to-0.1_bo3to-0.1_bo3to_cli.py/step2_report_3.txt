  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a simple function that prints a static message. All reports correctly identify that there are no inputs, external data sources, network activity, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No issues or malicious behavior are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, and the code is clearly benign, this is appropriate.\n   - No justification for higher risk scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n   - Correctly reflects that there is no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, static print statement with no inputs, external dependencies, or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores reflect the benign nature accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- No issues, malware, or obfuscation.\n- Scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No need for adjustments.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
