{
  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints 'It Works' with no inputs or external dependencies.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function 'cli()' that outputs a static message. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code contains no external data inputs, network activity, or hidden malicious code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No discrepancies or issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a trivial, benign function with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
