{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions and classes from the modules 'hyperroutine' and 'reqhandler', likely to use their functionalities within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules 'hyperroutine' and 'reqhandler'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible from import statements alone; no source-to-sink flows observable.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') is generally discouraged as it can hide malicious code or unintended behaviors, but does not indicate malicious intent by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing all symbols from two local modules. No data input, output, or external interactions are present. The use of wildcard imports may obscure which functions or classes are being imported, but this is a common pattern in Python packages and not inherently malicious. There is no evidence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious activity. The code is minimal and standard in structure.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code's purpose appears to be to include functionalities from local modules. The use of wildcard imports is a potential concern for code clarity but does not suggest malicious intent.",
