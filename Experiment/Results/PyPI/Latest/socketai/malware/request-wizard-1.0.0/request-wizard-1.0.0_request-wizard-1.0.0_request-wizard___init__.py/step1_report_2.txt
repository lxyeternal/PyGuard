  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can hide actual used functions and may introduce malicious code if the modules are compromised. No other anomalies evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing all contents from two local modules. Wildcard imports are generally discouraged due to potential namespace pollution and obscuring imported contents, but they are not inherently malicious. Without inspecting the contents of 'hyperroutine' and 'reqhandler', no malicious behavior can be determined. No suspicious code or behaviors are visible in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal import statement code snippet with no direct signs of malicious behavior. The use of wildcard imports warrants caution, but does not indicate malicious intent by itself. Further inspection of the imported modules is necessary for a comprehensive security assessment.",
