  "flows": "Potentially, exported functions/classes could be used elsewhere, but no flow is visible here.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure which elements are imported, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with wildcard imports from local modules. This pattern can hide which specific functions or classes are brought into scope, potentially masking malicious or sensitive functions. No other logic, input handling, or data transmission code is present to evaluate for malicious activity. Given only this snippet, there's no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code structure is minimal and standard for some Python projects, but wildcard imports are discouraged for clarity and security reasons.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement from local modules using wildcard syntax. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on this snippet alone. However, the use of wildcard imports is generally discouraged due to potential for hidden imports, but it does not constitute malicious behavior.",
