{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing all contents from two local modules: hyperroutine and reqhandler.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules 'hyperroutine' and 'reqhandler'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this snippet; potential concerns depend on imported modules' contents.",
  "flows": "No direct data flow or untrusted data handling shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure which functions or variables are imported, potentially hiding malicious or sensitive functions, but alone this is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements with wildcard imports from local modules. There are no visible data inputs, outputs, or code execution. Wildcard imports can be a code smell, making it harder to audit what is imported, but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code, external network calls, or credential handling are present here. Without additional context, this appears to be standard import practice, albeit with potential maintainability concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet does not contain malicious behavior based on the provided content. It simply imports modules; any malicious activity would depend on the contents of 'hyperroutine' and 'reqhandler'. No malware signs or security risks are evident here.",
