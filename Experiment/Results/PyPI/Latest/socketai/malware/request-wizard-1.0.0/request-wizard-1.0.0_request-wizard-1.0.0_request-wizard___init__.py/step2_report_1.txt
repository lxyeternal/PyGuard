  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .hyperroutine import *\nfrom .reqhandler import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary of the code:\n- Two import statements, importing all contents from local modules `hyperroutine` and `reqhandler`.\n- No data processing, no network activity, no explicit security-sensitive operations.\n- Use of wildcard imports, which can obscure which functions or variables are imported.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the import of local modules.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that no malicious behavior is evident; the wildcard import is a concern for maintainability, not security.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.7\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low risk score is justified given the minimal code and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes that wildcard imports are discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.6\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Similar to above, emphasizing the potential for obscured functions but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.6\n\n**Assessment:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that wildcard imports obscure specifics but are not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1, Confidence: 0.7\n\n**Assessment:** The very low security risk score is appropriate; the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Similar reasoning, emphasizing that no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.7\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign based solely on the import statements.\n- The use of wildcard imports is a concern for maintainability and clarity but not security.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external communication.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports, as no malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0**, since no obfuscation techniques are evident.\n- **Security risk score:** Given the minimal code and no malicious signs, a **low risk score (~0.1)** is appropriate, mainly due to wildcard imports' maintainability issues.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0.1** |\n\n**Justification:**  \n- No signs of malware or malicious behavior.  \n- Wildcard imports are discouraged but not malicious.  \n- The code is minimal and standard, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the current scores are appropriate, if additional context or content from `hyperroutine` and `reqhandler` modules were available, the assessment might change. As it stands, this code snippet is benign.",
