{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from local modules 'hyperroutine' and 'reqhandler' using wildcard imports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules 'hyperroutine' and 'reqhandler'.",
  "sinks": "No data inputs, outputs, network calls, or other security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports, which can obscure imported functions and reduce code clarity; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements with wildcard imports from local modules. No evidence of malicious activity, external communication, or data leakage. Wildcard imports are discouraged for maintainability but are not inherently malicious. The risk and malware scores are low, consistent with the minimal and benign nature of the snippet. Without inspecting the contents of 'hyperroutine' and 'reqhandler', no further malicious intent can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation. The primary concern is maintainability due to wildcard imports, but there is no indication of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.1-0.2) and malware score (0) are appropriate given the evidence.",
