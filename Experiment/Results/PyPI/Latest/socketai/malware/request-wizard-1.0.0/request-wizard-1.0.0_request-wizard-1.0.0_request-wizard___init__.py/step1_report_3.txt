{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from 'hyperroutine' and 'reqhandler' modules, likely for internal use within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules 'hyperroutine' and 'reqhandler'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified in this snippet; potential sinks depend on downstream usage of imported modules.",
  "flows": "Imported modules may contain source-to-sink flows, but no flows are explicitly present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure which functions or variables are imported, possibly hiding malicious or unintended code, but this is a common practice for internal modules and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains two import statements with wildcard imports from local modules. There are no direct data inputs, outputs, or code execution in this snippet. The use of wildcard imports can sometimes hide imported functions or variables, which could be risky if the modules contain malicious code, but in this context, it appears to be part of a larger project structure. No suspicious behaviors such as network connections, data leaks, or code injection are observable here. Due to the minimal nature of this code, there is no evidence of malicious intent, and the overall security risk appears low.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet performs simple imports from local modules with no direct malicious activity or security issues evident. The use of wildcard imports could be a concern in some contexts, but it is typical in internal package modules. Overall, no malicious behavior or significant security risks are apparent.",
