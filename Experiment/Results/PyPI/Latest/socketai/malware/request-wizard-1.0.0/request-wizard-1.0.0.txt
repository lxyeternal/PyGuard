      "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious, stealthy info-stealer designed for extensive data exfiltration. It exhibits multiple behaviors consistent with malware, including decryption of stored credentials, process termination, stealth techniques, and exfiltration via hardcoded webhooks and file uploads. The overall security risk is maximal, and the malware presence is confirmed."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including remote code download, execution, and persistence mechanisms. The use of obfuscation tactics further supports malicious intent. The placeholder URL indicates it is a template for malicious payloads. Overall, the script is highly malicious and poses a significant security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation. The primary concern is maintainability due to wildcard imports, but there is no indication of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.1-0.2) and malware score (0) are appropriate given the evidence."
