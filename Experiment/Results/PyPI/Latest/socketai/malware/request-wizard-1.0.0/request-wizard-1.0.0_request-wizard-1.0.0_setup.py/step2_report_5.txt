  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, static setup script for a Python package named 'request-wizard'.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- The only minor anomaly is the empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields, which is typical in incomplete package metadata but not suspicious.\n\n**Code confirmation:**\n- The original code matches the described static setup script. It uses `setuptools` with `find_packages()` and static metadata. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The empty author fields could be considered incomplete but not malicious.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n- These are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Risk and malware justification:**\n- Since there's no malicious activity, malware score should remain 0.\n- The security risk is minimal; just incomplete metadata, so 0 is appropriate.\n- Confidence is high (1) because the analysis aligns with the code.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code is straightforward.\n- No evidence suggests potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Consistency:**\n- Scores are consistent with the report content and the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Justification:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, or network activity.\n- The only minor concern is incomplete metadata, which does not impact security.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their benign assessment. The code is safe, and no changes to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nBased on this review, I agree with the current scores. The package appears completely benign with no security concerns.",
