  "purpose": "Configure the package setup for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports modules and defines static parameters for package setup.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only executes static configuration functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' modules to define package metadata and configuration. It sets version, name, author, author email, and packages. There are no input validation, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package setup. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious intent, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious or security concern indicators. It serves the purpose of defining package metadata for distribution without any suspicious behavior.",
