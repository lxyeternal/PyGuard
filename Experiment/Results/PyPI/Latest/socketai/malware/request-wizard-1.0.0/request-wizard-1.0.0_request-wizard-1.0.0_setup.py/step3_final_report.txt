  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'request-wizard' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static metadata within the setup() call, including version, name, author, author_email, and packages found via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "None; no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields, which are minor metadata omissions but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, minimal setup script utilizing setuptools. It contains static metadata and calls find_packages() to include all packages in the directory. No external data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The absence of author details is not inherently malicious. The code aligns with standard packaging practices, and no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scoring is justified. No modifications or escalations are necessary.",
