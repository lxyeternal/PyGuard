  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code, a standard setup.py script for a Python package named 'request-wizard'.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and uses common practices.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The only minor anomaly is the absence of author and author_email fields, which is not suspicious by itself.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Issue Presence Confirmation:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the original code snippet. No issues or malicious behaviors are present.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard, and secure.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify the code as a typical setup script with no security issues.\n- They mention the empty author fields as a minor anomaly, which is reasonable and not suspicious.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent in the reports.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All report scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, which is justified.\n\n**Suggestion:** No score adjustments needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Risk Justification:\n- Since the code is a standard setup script with no suspicious behaviors, the **risk score** should remain at **0**.\n- The **malware score** is correctly at **0**.\n- The **obfuscated score** is correctly at **0**.\n\n### Potential Assumptions and Claims:\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; the reports correctly analyze the static code.\n- No external data handling or dynamic behaviors are assumed or claimed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, typical Python package setup script with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep all scores at zero, reflecting the code's safe and standard nature.",
