  "purpose": "Setuptools setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'request-wizard'.",
  "sources": "Static code in the setup.py script; no external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network or file operations; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive operations; the script primarily defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of author and author_email details, but this alone is not unusual or suspicious; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata such as version, name, author, and packages. It employs find_packages() to automatically include packages. No external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic are present. The script appears to be a minimal, typical setup file for packaging a Python project. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup configuration for a Python package. No malicious intent or security issues are detected.",
