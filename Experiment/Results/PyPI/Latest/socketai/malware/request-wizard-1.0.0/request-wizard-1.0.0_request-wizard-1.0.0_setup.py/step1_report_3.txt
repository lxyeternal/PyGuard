{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging a Python project named 'request-wizard'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it uses static string values for version, name, author, and email. The only function called is find_packages() to discover packages.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely constructs a setup configuration with static values.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hidden code, or obfuscated elements present. The code is straightforward and conventional for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, defines a setup() call with static metadata, and discovers packages using find_packages(). There are no indications of malicious behavior, no input handling, and no dynamic code execution. The code is typical for Python package configuration. No suspicious patterns or code anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares package metadata for distribution.",
