  "purpose": "This script functions as a malware/spyware tool designed to steal sensitive user data, including tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers, applications, and directories. It also exfiltrates collected data to remote webhooks and upload services.",
  "sources": "Reads data from browser storage files (LevelDB and SQLite databases), local state files for decryption keys, log files (.log, .ldb), user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents), and application-specific folders (Opera, Chrome, Brave, Yandex, Edge, Discord, Telegram, Steam, Wallets, and others). It also reads environment variables for system info.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected tokens, passwords, cookies, and files to remote webhooks and file upload services (e.g., requests.post, urlopen requests). Uploads data to external servers and stores sensitive info in variables for further processing.",
  "flows": "Extracts tokens and decrypts credentials from browser databases, then uploads them via HTTP POST requests to predefined webhooks. Files are zipped and uploaded to anonymous file hosting services. System info, IP, and user info are gathered and sent alongside other data. Data flows from local storage, databases, user directories, through decryption and parsing, to external webhooks/uploads.",
  "anomalies": "The script installs missing modules silently via subprocess, uses hardcoded webhook URLs, performs system kill commands on processes (e.g., 'taskkill'), and obfuscates some parts. It processes user directories and application files without explicit user consent. Multiple threads run data collection and zipping concurrently, and some code sections have inconsistent formatting or dead code comments. The presence of functions like 'uploadToken', 'GatherZips', 'ZipThings', 'KiwiFolder', and 'KiwiFile' all indicate automated exfiltration activities. No clear user interaction or legitimate purpose is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script initiates by importing various modules, some installed silently if missing, indicating possible stealth. It gathers system info, user tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from multiple browsers and applications, decrypting credentials where necessary. It also downloads and installs dependencies, performs threading for concurrent data collection, zips files, and uploads everything to remote webhooks and anonymous hosting services. It captures system details, geolocation, user info, and exfiltrates it stealthily. The code uses hardcoded webhooks, uses process termination commands on known applications, and employs multithreading for efficient data harvesting. Its overall design aligns with typical credential stealer, info logger, and file exfiltration malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is clearly malicious, designed to stealthily collect sensitive user data, credentials, and files, and then exfiltrate this data to remote servers. It operates without user consent, installs dependencies silently, and targets a wide range of applications and data sources. The presence of multiple functions dedicated to data theft, anonymized uploads, and system manipulation confirms its malicious intent.",
