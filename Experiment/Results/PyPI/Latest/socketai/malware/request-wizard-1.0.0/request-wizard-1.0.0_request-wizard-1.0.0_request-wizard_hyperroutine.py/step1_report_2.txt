  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed for extracting sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers, applications, and system directories, then uploading this data to remote webhooks and file hosting services.",
  "sources": "Reading local files related to browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), Discord, Steam, and other applications; intercepting network responses; capturing tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data from the file system and memory; extracting data from SQLite databases and JSON files; reading environment variables and system info; capturing IP address and geolocation info.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via HTTP POST requests to specified webhooks and upload URLs; writing files to temporary directories; uploading files to file hosting services; executing system commands like taskkill; installing missing modules via subprocess.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files are read from local system paths, decrypted or parsed, stored in variables, then transmitted via network requests (LoadUrlib, requests.post) to external servers or webhooks. Some data is written to local temp files before uploading. The code also initiates multiple threads for parallel processing of files and zipping operations.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URLs and upload URLs; use of subprocess to install modules silently; malicious pattern of reading browser data and credentials; execution of system commands to kill processes; creation of zip archives of user files; data exfiltration activities concealed within multiple functions; potential for continuous or repeated data theft; unencrypted transmission of sensitive data; code lacks clear user consent or legitimate purpose; use of external geolocation API for user info.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured to harvest a wide range of sensitive user data from local browser profiles, applications, and files, then exfiltrate this data to external endpoints. It employs multi-threading to process multiple sources simultaneously, decrypts stored passwords and tokens, and uploads zipped files. It also attempts to install necessary modules dynamically, indicating an effort to ensure its operations. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs and multiple functions for capturing tokens, cookies, passwords, and files points to malicious intent, aimed at clandestine data collection. The use of subprocess to kill processes related to browser and wallet applications further suggests attempts to interfere with user activity or ensure access to files. The overall behavior aligns with typical malware or info-stealer activity, with multiple obfuscated or hidden operations.\n\nThe script operates without user consent, extracts sensitive data, and transmits it to external servers, which constitutes malicious activity. It also attempts to hide its actions with threading and module installation, indicating deliberate concealment.",
