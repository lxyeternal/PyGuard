  "purpose": "This script appears to be designed for extracting sensitive information such as Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and other user data from browsers, applications, and files, then uploading this information to a remote webhook or file hosting service. It also includes features for zipping files, gathering geolocation info, and potentially searching user directories for specific data.",
  "sources": "Data is read from browser storage files, log files, login databases, cookies, local state files, and user directories. It also reads environment variables and makes network requests for geolocation and IP info.",
  "sinks": "Uploads data to external webhooks and file hosting services; potentially sends tokens, passwords, cookies, and personal data over the network. Also writes data to temporary files and creates ZIP archives of files found on disk.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data from browser databases, cookies, environment variables, and local files are decrypted, processed, and then transmitted via HTTP requests to external webhook URLs. Files are compressed and uploaded to file hosting services, then links are shared.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated and convoluted regex patterns, unneeded dynamic library calls, and multiple redundant imports. It dynamically installs dependencies at runtime. There are explicit hardcoded webhook URLs and references to 'stealer' in comments and variable names. The code attempts to kill processes (e.g., 'taskkill /im') and collects data from multiple browsers and applications without user consent. Some functions like 'uploadToAnonfiles' are designed to upload files and return download links, which are then used for further sharing. The script contains numerous indicators of malicious intent such as stealing tokens, passwords, cookies, and files, then exfiltrating them to remote servers.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to gather a wide range of user data including browser-stored passwords, cookies, Discord tokens, and other sensitive files. It decrypts stored browser data using Windows APIs and master keys, then compiles and uploads this information. It searches user directories for files containing sensitive keywords and zips potential data, then uploads and shares links. It also collects IP and geolocation info. Multiple external URLs (webhook and file host) are hardcoded for exfiltration, indicating purpose of data theft. Process killing commands suggest attempts to terminate security or browser processes. The code dynamically installs dependencies, obfuscates some regex patterns, and heavily relies on multithreading for parallel data collection—all typical traits of malware designed for stealth and efficiency. Overall, the code's behavior is consistent with a data-stealing malware that exfiltrates personal and sensitive information to external servers.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits clear malicious intent as a data-stealer targeting browser credentials, tokens, cookies, and user files, then exfiltrates this data via webhooks and file hosting services. It contains multiple suspicious behaviors, including process termination, dynamic dependency installation, and extensive data collection without user consent. Given its functionality and indicators, it qualifies as malware with high maliciousness risk.",
