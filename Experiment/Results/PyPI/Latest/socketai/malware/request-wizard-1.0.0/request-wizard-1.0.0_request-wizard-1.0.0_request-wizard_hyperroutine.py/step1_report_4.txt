{
  "purpose": "The script functions as a malicious data stealer, designed to extract sensitive information such as Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and files from the user's system, and exfiltrate the data via Discord webhooks and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Input sources include system environment variables, local files (logins, cookies, Local State files, browser storage), and network requests (geolocation API, Discord API, file uploads).",
  "sinks": "Sinks include requests to Discord webhooks, HTTP POST requests for data exfiltration, file uploads to third-party services, and subprocess calls to kill processes or manipulate files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local system data extraction (browser storage, login databases, environment variables), through decryption and parsing functions, then to network requests that send collected data to external webhooks and upload files.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains hardcoded webhook URLs, aggressive automatic package installations, process termination commands for browsers, multiple threads performing concurrent file zipping and data extraction, and obfuscated or misleading variable/function names. Notably, it kills browser processes, downloads and executes code, and manipulates user files with no user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script is structured as a malware toolkit. It begins with dependencies setup, then gathers system and browser data including IP, Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and files matching certain keywords. It decrypts stored credentials, gathers browser artifacts, and exfiltrates data via webhooks and file hosting. It includes functions for data collection, decryption, and file zipping, often using threading for parallelism. It terminates processes related to browsers and certain applications to facilitate data extraction. Hardcoded webhooks and obfuscation signals indicate malicious intent. It exfiltrates sensitive info without user approval, aiming to compromise user privacy and system integrity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, intended for unauthorized data theft and system compromise. It collects sensitive user data, terminates security-related processes, and exfiltrates the data stealthily. It demonstrates clear malicious behavior with high security risk and malware scores.",
