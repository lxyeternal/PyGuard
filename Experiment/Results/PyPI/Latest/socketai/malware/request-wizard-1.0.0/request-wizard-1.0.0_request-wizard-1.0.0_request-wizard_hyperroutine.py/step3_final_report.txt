{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a comprehensive info-stealer targeting tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from browsers, applications, and system directories. It decrypts stored credentials, exfiltrates data via webhooks and uploads, terminates related processes, and employs obfuscation and stealth techniques to evade detection.",
  "sources": "Browser storage files (LevelDB, SQLite), user directories, environment variables, system files, network responses, and local state files.",
  "sinks": "Hardcoded webhooks, file upload services (e.g., gofile.io), network requests, and process termination commands.",
  "flows": "Data is read from local storage, decrypted using Windows APIs, processed in-memory, then transmitted via network requests or uploaded files. Multi-threading is used for efficiency, with data flowing from local sources to exfiltration endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated regex patterns, dynamic dependency installation via subprocess, hardcoded exfiltration URLs, process termination commands (taskkill), multi-threaded file zipping, and stealthy data collection without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script exhibits behaviors characteristic of malware: extensive data theft, decryption of stored credentials, stealthy exfiltration, process termination to access locked files, and obfuscation techniques. It dynamically installs dependencies, uses threading for efficiency, and exfiltrates data via hardcoded webhooks and file uploads. The code's structure and functions align with typical info-stealers and malicious scripts, with multiple indicators of malicious intent and stealth.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious, stealthy info-stealer designed for extensive data exfiltration. It exhibits multiple behaviors consistent with malware, including decryption of stored credentials, process termination, stealth techniques, and exfiltration via hardcoded webhooks and file uploads. The overall security risk is maximal, and the malware presence is confirmed.",
