  "purpose": "A simple test function returning a static string, serving as a benign placeholder or example.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data reads, or dependencies; static return value.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static code with no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static function with no inputs, outputs, dependencies, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, which is appropriate. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
