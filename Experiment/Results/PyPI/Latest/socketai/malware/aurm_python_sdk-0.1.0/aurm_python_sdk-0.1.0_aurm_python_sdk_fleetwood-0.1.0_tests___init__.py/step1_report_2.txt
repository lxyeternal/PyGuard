  "purpose": "Initialize the package namespace for tests by importing test_function from module1",
  "sources": "Import statement importing test_function from a local module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present",
  "flows": "Import statement loads test_function into the namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; simple import and __all__ assignment",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package initialization file (__init__.py) that imports a function from a local module and defines the public API. It does not include any user input handling, network operations, or other behaviors that could pose security risks. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code serves a typical purpose for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
