  "purpose": "This is an initialization script for the tests package, importing test_function from module1 for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sink operations or data output points found.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a test function from another module and exposes it via __all__, typical for Python package initialization. No malicious behavior, no data leakage, or suspicious operations are present. It is a standard practice in Python packages to control namespace exposure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be a standard, non-malicious package initialization file with no security concerns.",
