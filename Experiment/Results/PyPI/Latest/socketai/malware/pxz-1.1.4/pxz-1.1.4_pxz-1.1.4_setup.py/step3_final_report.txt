{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (public IP, hostname, directories) and transmits it to a remote server during package setup, without user consent, indicating covert data exfiltration or surveillance.",
  "sources": "os.popen(\"curl -s ifconfig.me\") to retrieve public IP, os.uname()[1] for hostname, os.path.expanduser(\"~\") for home directory, os.getcwd() for current directory",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call sending data to http://10.0.2.15:8080/collect_info.php",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() gathers data from sources and sends via requests.get() to the remote server during setup() execution",
  "anomalies": "Data collection and transmission occur during package setup without user notification; use of curl via os.popen() for IP retrieval; data sent to internal IP address; no obfuscation or encryption",
  "analysis": "The code performs system info collection and exfiltration stealthily during package installation, using straightforward methods. It does not contain obfuscation or destructive payloads but exhibits suspicious behavior indicative of covert surveillance or exfiltration. The use of internal IPs and silent transmission amplifies malicious potential. The activity aligns with malicious reconnaissance or privacy invasion, warranting high security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious intent through covert data exfiltration during package setup, with no user notification. It should be flagged as highly suspicious and potentially malicious, with a high malware and security risk score.",
