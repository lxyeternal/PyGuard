{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package and includes a function to collect and send system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The function collect_system_info() reads system data such as public IP via a shell command, hostname via os.uname(), and current directories. It also imports the requests library to perform HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function sends system data to an external IP address (http://10.0.2.15:8080/collect_info.php). This action could leak system information to an attacker-controlled server.",
  "flows": "Source: Reading system info via os.popen() and os.uname(); Request sink: requests.get() sending data to external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects system info (public IP, hostname, directories) and transmits it to a private IP address. The use of curl in os.popen() and sending data to an internal IP suggests possible malicious intent or covert data collection. No user input or explicit permission checks are present.",
  "analysis": "The script's primary function appears to be gathering system details and sending them to a specific internal IP address. This behavior is often associated with reconnaissance or data exfiltration. The setup() portion is standard for packaging, but the preceding function's behavior is suspicious, especially as it runs automatically upon import or execution. The use of os.popen() with curl may be a method to bypass Python's security boundaries. The data sent could be used for malicious tracking or intrusion activities. No evidence of obfuscation or code hiding techniques is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system reconnaissance by collecting and transmitting system information to a local network address without user consent. This behavior is suspicious and indicates potential malicious activity or covert data exfiltration, especially in a package context.",
