{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that also collects and sends system information to a specified server, possibly for malicious surveillance or data collection.",
  "sources": "os.popen('curl -s ifconfig.me'), os.uname(), os.path.expanduser('~'), os.getcwd(), requests.get()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() sending data to 'http://10.0.2.15:8080/collect_info.php'",
  "flows": "Data collected from system info functions flows directly into the HTTP GET request, which transmits it to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects sensitive system info (public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory) and transmits it to an internal IP address without user consent; unusual in a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs system data collection (public IP, hostname, directories) and immediately transmits this information to a local IP address over the network, which is suspicious. The data collection is embedded in the package setup script, which is an unconventional place for such behavior. The use of 'curl' via os.popen and sending data via GET request to a private IP suggests malicious intent, such as spying or exfiltration. The code does not sanitize or validate data, and the IP address indicates potential insider or local malicious activity. The rest of the setup code is standard for package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and transmitting it to a remote server without user consent. The data collection and transmission are embedded in a seemingly legitimate setup script, indicating a supply chain threat. This activity likely aims at surveillance or data exfiltration.",
