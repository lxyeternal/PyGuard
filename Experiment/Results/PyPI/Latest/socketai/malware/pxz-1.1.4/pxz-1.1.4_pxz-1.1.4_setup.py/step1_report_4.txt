{
  "purpose": "Collects and sends system information (public IP, hostname, directories) to a specified server.",
  "sources": "Reads system information such as public IP via curl, hostname via os.uname(), and directory paths via os functions; makes an HTTP GET request with collected data.",
  "sinks": "Network request to http://10.0.2.15:8080/collect_info.php with system data as parameters.",
  "flows": "Source: Data collection functions -> Sink: HTTP GET request to remote server with system info as parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'curl' via os.popen() to retrieve public IP instead of a more secure method; sends data over unencrypted HTTP; no validation or encryption of data; hardcoded IP address for data collection; no user consent or notice.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system details including public IP, hostname, home and current directories. It then transmits this data to a hardcoded IP address via an unencrypted GET request. Such behavior resembles data exfiltration without user awareness. The use of 'curl' through os.popen() and direct network communication indicates potentially malicious intent, especially if used without user knowledge. The code's main purpose appears to be stealthy data collection and transmission, typical of malicious scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized collection and transmission of system information to an external server, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. Its behavior indicates possible privacy invasion or backdoor activity. It warrants a security warning and further review.",
