{
  "purpose": "The script searches for specific Telegram Desktop folders across multiple drives, copies their contents excluding certain files and directories, compresses the data, and uploads it to a remote server. It appears designed to exfiltrate user data related to Telegram.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem (searching drives, directories, and files), environment variables (TEMP), and network responses (HTTP GET request to retrieve existing directory numbers).",
  "sinks": "Uploads data via HTTP POST request to a remote server, reads files from disk, writes to temporary directories, and deletes files after upload.",
  "flows": "Folder search -> file copying -> compression -> HTTP POST upload. Data flows from filesystem inputs through copying/compression to network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The script searches for specific user data folders, copies potentially sensitive files, compresses and uploads them to a suspicious IP address, and deletes local copies afterward. No explicit user consent or notification is apparent. The use of dynamic directory naming and data exfiltration behavior is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code searches across drives for Telegram Desktop folders, specifically targeting those containing 'Telegram.exe'. It copies relevant files, excluding certain known safe files and directories, and creates a ZIP archive. It then attempts to determine a directory number from the server response to use as metadata, and uploads the archive to a remote IP address. Post-upload, it cleans up local copies. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, as it targets user-specific data related to Telegram, compresses potentially large amounts of data, and uploads it to an external server without user knowledge. No obfuscated code or malicious backdoors are evident, but the pattern of behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with data theft or espionage activities.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears designed to silently collect and exfiltrate user data from Telegram Desktop folders across multiple drives. It communicates with a suspicious IP address, likely for malicious purposes such as data theft. No overt malware mechanisms like system damage or reverse shells are present, but the data exfiltration activity poses a significant security risk.",
