{
  "purpose": "The script searches for specific folders on multiple drives, collects files excluding certain patterns, compresses them, and uploads the archive to a remote server. It appears designed to exfiltrate data from the system.",
  "sources": "Reading 'started.txt', enumerating drives, walking through directories, reading files for compression and upload, reading environment variables for TEMP.",
  "sinks": "Uploading data via HTTP POST to an external IP, writing to temporary directories, deleting files and folders locally.",
  "flows": "Directory enumeration → filtering files → copying files to temp → compressing files → uploading archive → cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "The code searches for specific folder names, copies files, compresses and exfiltrates them without user consent. Use of hardcoded IP address and specific folder patterns suggest potential malicious intent. The code handles environment variables for temp paths, and deletes local copies after upload, indicating data exfiltration behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to locate folders named 'Telegram Desktop' across multiple drives, filter out specific directories and files, and then copy relevant files to a temporary directory. It then compresses these files into a ZIP archive and uploads it to a remote server via an HTTP POST request. The remote server address is hardcoded, and the process involves obfuscation of file selection through exclusion lists. The use of environment variables for temp directories, combined with deleting local copies after exfiltration, points to behavior consistent with data theft or unauthorized data collection. There are no signs of code obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code execution such as system damage or system control, but the purpose aligns with malicious data exfiltration activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely malicious or at least intended for malicious data exfiltration, as it searches for specific folders, collects user files, compresses, and uploads them to an external IP without user consent. Its design and behavior are typical of malware aimed at covertly stealing data from the system.",
