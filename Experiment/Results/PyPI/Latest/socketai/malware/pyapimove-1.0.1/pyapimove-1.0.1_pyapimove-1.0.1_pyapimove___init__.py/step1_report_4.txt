{
  "purpose": "The script searches specific directories on multiple drives for a folder named 'Telegram Desktop' containing 'Telegram.exe', copies its contents excluding certain files and directories, compresses the data, and uploads it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads 'started.txt', environment variable 'TEMP', filesystem for directories and files, and makes HTTP GET and POST requests to the specified IP address.",
  "sinks": "Uploads compressed data via HTTP POST request to the specified remote server, reads 'started.txt', and deletes temporary files.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables and filesystem data, compresses selected files, then sends the archive over HTTP to the remote server, and cleans up temporary files.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded IP address and URL, searches across multiple drives for specific folders, captures and uploads potentially sensitive user data without explicit user consent, and performs automated data exfiltration. The code ignores permission errors silently, which could mask issues. The use of 'started.txt' as a log file and deletion of temporary files suggests obfuscation of process flow.",
  "analysis": "The code's main activity is to locate specific user data folders related to 'Telegram Desktop', copy their contents while excluding certain files, compress this data, and send it to a remote server. It dynamically determines a directory number by querying the remote server, which might be used for identification or organization of uploads. The code does not validate or encrypt the data before upload, and the remote server address is hardcoded, indicating potential malicious intent for unauthorized data exfiltration. The absence of user prompts, logging, or any user notifications further suggests malicious or covert behavior. Overall, the script appears designed to harvest user data and transmit it without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior through data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user files from 'Telegram Desktop' directories, automated collection across multiple drives, and silent upload to a suspicious remote server. Its purpose appears to be clandestine data theft, with no legitimate functionality or user interaction. The use of hardcoded IP, silent failure handling, and automation strongly indicate malicious intent.",
