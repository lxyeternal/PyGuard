{
  "purpose": "The script searches specific folders on multiple drives for a 'Telegram Desktop' folder containing 'Telegram.exe', copies and compresses its contents (excluding certain files and directories), and uploads the archive to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading 'started.txt', reading 'Telegram.exe' and other files within 'Telegram Desktop' folder, environment variables (TEMP), network requests (GET to upload URL, POST with archive), reading local directories and files during search and copy process.",
  "sinks": "Network requests (HTTP GET and POST) to remote server at 77.91.76.45:100, reading files for archiving and uploading, deletion of temporary files.",
  "flows": "Folder and file data are read and copied to a temp directory, compressed into ZIP, then uploaded via POST request; URL is fetched via GET to determine a directory number; files are deleted afterward.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual activity includes automated collection and exfiltration of folder contents without user consent, dynamic URL generation for uploads, hardcoded IP address and port, no user prompts or logs, deletion of files after upload, no validation or encryption of data, potential misuse of environment variables. No evident obfuscation, but code structure is straightforwardly malicious-like behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code searches for a specific folder ('Telegram Desktop') across multiple drives, then copies its contents (excluding specific files and directories) into a temporary directory. It compresses these files into a ZIP archive and uploads the archive to a remote server using an HTTP POST request. The server URL is hardcoded with an IP address and port, which suggests potential data exfiltration. The process of determining a directory number from a server response indicates the script might be designed to send data periodically or in sequence. The script deletes the temporary files and archive after uploading, reducing traces locally. The behavior resembles data theft or surveillance, especially if used without user consent. No obfuscated code or malware-like functions (such as reverse shells or system damage) are evident, but the activity pattern is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script automates the collection of specific folder contents, compresses, and exfiltrates them to a remote server without user knowledge, indicating malicious intent. While not explicitly malicious like malware (e.g., backdoors, damage), it demonstrates potentially harmful behavior as a data exfiltration tool.",
