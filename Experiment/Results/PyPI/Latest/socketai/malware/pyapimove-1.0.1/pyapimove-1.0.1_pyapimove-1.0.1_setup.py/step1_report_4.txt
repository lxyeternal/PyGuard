  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'pyapimove' Python project, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() call: package name, version, description, author info, classifiers, and Python requirements.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; this script does not process untrusted input or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the script only defines package metadata without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious behavior; the code is a standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setuptools functions and defines a setup() call with fixed metadata. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. No execution of code, network operations, or system modifications are present. It appears to be a typical packaging script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup configuration for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
