  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields such as name, version, description, author info, classifiers, and requirements.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data processing.",
  "flows": "None; static configuration without data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'import API' string in long_description, which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with static parameters. No dynamic code execution, user input, or external data handling. The 'import API' in long_description is just a string, not code, and does not pose a security risk. No obfuscation, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The minor anomaly ('import API') does not justify increased risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate. The slight mention of 'import API' in long_description does not elevate the risk.",
