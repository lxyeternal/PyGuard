  "purpose": "To configure and package a Python project named 'pyapimove' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters and the import statements at the beginning.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data output in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A - this code is purely configuration; no data flow analysis needed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is standard setup configuration. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with package metadata, including name, version, author info, and classifiers. All parameters are static strings, and there is no user input or external data processing. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The purpose is clear: to package the project for distribution. The code appears legitimate and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for Python packaging. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It is safe and typical for open-source Python projects.",
