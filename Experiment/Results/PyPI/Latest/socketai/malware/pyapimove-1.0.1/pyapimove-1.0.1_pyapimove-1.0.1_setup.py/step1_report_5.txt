  "purpose": "Configure the package setup for distribution of the 'pyapimove' Python package.",
  "sources": "User-provided setup parameters; find_packages() function to discover packages.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks for untrusted input or output; no network, file, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks indicating malicious activity; setup parameters are static.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import API' in long_description is unconventional but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, utilizing setuptools to define package metadata and requirements. No external input, environment variables, or network operations are present. The use of 'import API' in long_description may be a placeholder or a comment but does not pose security issues. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious functions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, serving only to define package metadata without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
