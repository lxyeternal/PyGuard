{
  "purpose": "The script searches specific directories on drives C through G for a folder named 'Telegram Desktop' containing 'Telegram.exe', then copies its contents, compresses them, and uploads the archive to a remote server.",
  "sources": "User-controlled environment variables (TEMP), directory traversal via os.walk, network responses (requests.get and requests.post)",
  "sinks": "Requests to external server (http://77.91.76.45:100/OPEN), file system operations (reading, writing, deleting files and directories), network transmission of compressed data",
  "flows": "Folder traversal -> copying files -> compressing files -> uploading archive to external server",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional access to drives C-G for specific folder and executable presence, dynamic URL fetching and incrementing directory number from server response, automatic and silent file operations without user consent, immediate deletion of temporary files post-upload, use of hardcoded IP address and URL",
  "analysis": "The code searches multiple drives for a folder named 'Telegram Desktop' containing 'Telegram.exe'. It copies relevant files to a temporary directory, compresses them, and uploads the archive to a specified remote IP. The URL and directory number are dynamically obtained, potentially allowing control over the server endpoint or data collection. The behavior resembles data exfiltration or a form of malware due to automated collection and transmission of potentially sensitive data without user interaction or authorization. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious payloads like reverse shells but performs actions typical of spyware or information-stealing malware.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits behavior consistent with data collection and exfiltration from user systems, potentially malicious, especially considering automated searches across multiple drives, silent data compression, and transmission to a remote server. While not explicitly malicious in a traditional payload sense, it strongly resembles spyware or malware due to its hidden, unsolicited data harvesting activities.",
