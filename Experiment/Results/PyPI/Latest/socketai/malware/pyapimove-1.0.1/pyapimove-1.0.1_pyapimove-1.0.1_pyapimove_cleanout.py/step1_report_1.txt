{
  "purpose": "The script searches for specific folders named 'Telegram Desktop' across multiple drives, collects certain files excluding specified ones, compresses them into a ZIP archive, and uploads the archive to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (TEMP), filesystem (drives C-G, specific directories and files), and network (HTTP GET and POST requests).",
  "sinks": "Network requests to a specific IP address for GET and POST, and file system modifications (creation and deletion of temp directories and ZIP archive).",
  "flows": "Filesystem traversal -> copying files to temp directory -> zipping files -> uploading ZIP via POST request -> cleanup. Also, HTTP GET requests determine upload directories.",
  "anomalies": "The script collects potentially sensitive user files from Telegram Desktop directories without user consent, uploads compressed data to an external IP address, and deletes local copies afterward. The IP address used for upload is suspicious and indicates potential data exfiltration. It bypasses user interaction and does not notify the user.",
  "analysis": "The code performs automated collection of specific files from user directories related to Telegram Desktop, compresses these files into an archive, and uploads them to an external server at 77.91.76.45:100. It dynamically determines a directory number from a remote server response, likely used to distinguish uploads or track sessions. The process involves filesystem traversal across multiple drives, filtering files to exclude known safe or irrelevant files, and managing temporary files and directories. The network communication uses HTTP GET to obtain a directory number and HTTP POST to send the collected archive, which can be malicious if used for unauthorized data exfiltration. The use of hardcoded IP address, dynamic directory number, and silent file operations suggest malicious intent, potentially aimed at stealing user data from Telegram Desktop application folders.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be malicious, designed to stealthily gather user data from Telegram Desktop folders, compress it, and exfiltrate it to an external IP address. Its behavior resembles data theft malware, with no legitimate user-driven purpose. The presence of remote control over which files to upload and the automatic operation across drives further supports malicious intent.",
