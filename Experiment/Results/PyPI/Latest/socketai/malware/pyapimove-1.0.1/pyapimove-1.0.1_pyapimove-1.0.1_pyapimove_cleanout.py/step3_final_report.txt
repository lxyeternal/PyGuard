  "purpose": "Automated collection of user data from Telegram Desktop folders, compressing, and exfiltrating to an external server without user consent.",
  "sources": "Filesystem access to 'Telegram Desktop' directories, reading environment variables, network requests to hardcoded IP.",
  "sinks": "Network POST request sending the ZIP archive, file system operations for copying, compressing, and deleting files.",
  "flows": "Filesystem traversal -> copying files -> compressing -> HTTP GET to determine session number -> HTTP POST to exfiltrate data -> cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling, hardcoded IP and URL, automated cross-drive scanning, no user notification or consent, use of regex for response parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code searches for specific folders, filters files, copies relevant data into a temp directory, compresses it, and uploads it to a fixed IP address. It determines a session number via a GET request, then deletes local copies. No obfuscation or user prompts are present. The behavior indicates stealthy data exfiltration, characteristic of malicious spyware or malware. Exception handling suppresses errors, but no critical bugs are evident. The code operates across multiple drives without validation, but this does not negate its malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs covert data collection and exfiltration, exhibiting behaviors typical of malicious spyware or data theft malware. It lacks obfuscation but operates silently and without user consent. The high malware and security risk scores are justified based on its behavior.",
