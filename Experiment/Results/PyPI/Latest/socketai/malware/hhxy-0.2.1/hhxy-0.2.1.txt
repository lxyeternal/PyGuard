      "conclusion": "The setup code itself is benign and standard. The potential risk depends on the implementation of 'install_and_run', which is not available. Therefore, based solely on this code, there is no evidence of malicious activity; the risk is minimal but warrants review of the external function."

      "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic features that warrant cautious review. The scores assigned are justified, with the primary concern in Report 1. Slightly increasing the security risk score for reports with dynamic features could improve sensitivity, but current scores are appropriate."
