  "security_risk": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic features that warrant cautious review. The scores assigned are justified, with the primary concern in Report 1. Slightly increasing the security risk score for reports with dynamic features could improve sensitivity, but current scores are appropriate."
