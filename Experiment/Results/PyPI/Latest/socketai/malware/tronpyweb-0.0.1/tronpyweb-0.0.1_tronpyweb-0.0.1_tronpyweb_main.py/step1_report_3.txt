  "purpose": "Send private key data to a remote API endpoint and retrieve switcher status.",
  "sources": "The private_key parameter and the constructed transaction_data list.",
  "sinks": "Requests POST to external API with transaction data, GET request to retrieve switcher status.",
  "flows": "private_key -> transaction_data -> requests.post -> requests.get -> switcher.json()",
  "anomalies": "The private_key is stored in a set within a list, which is unusual; sending private key over network; lack of validation or encryption; possible data leakage.",
  "analysis": "The code takes a private_key input, places it into a set within a list, and sends it via POST request to an external URL. It then performs a GET request to retrieve data from another endpoint. The use of a set in transaction_data is unusual but not inherently malicious. However, transmitting a private key over the network without encryption or obfuscation raises security concerns. No evident malicious behavior such as data theft, backdoors, or system manipulation is directly observable. Nonetheless, the handling of sensitive data in this manner could lead to credential compromise or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary concern is the insecure transmission of private key data, which could be exploited if intercepted. It does not appear to contain malicious code or backdoors, but it exhibits poor security practices regarding sensitive data handling.",
