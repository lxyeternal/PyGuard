  "purpose": "This code imports the symbol 'perm' from a local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; it's a static import statement with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard Python relative import statement. It imports 'perm' from a local module 'main'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The minimal nature of the code indicates a benign intent. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard import with no issues. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The security risk score should be zero, reflecting the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores should be set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, aligning with the benign nature of the code.",
