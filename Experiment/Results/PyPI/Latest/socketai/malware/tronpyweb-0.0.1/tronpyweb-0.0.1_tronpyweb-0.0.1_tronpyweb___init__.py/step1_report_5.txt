  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads code from a local module file 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present; import statement alone does not execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; import is static code loading.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only a relative import statement; no anomalies or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement that loads 'perm' from a local module 'main'. This is a standard Python import and does not involve any data handling, user input, or execution of untrusted code. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this single line.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns. It does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious intent.",
