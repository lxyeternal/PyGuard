{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'perm' object or function from the local 'main' module, likely for permission handling or a similar purpose.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module 'main'. No external input or data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving untrusted input; the import simply loads code from a local module.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; the only notable aspect is the relative import which is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious function calls, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The snippet consists of a single import statement from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The import appears straightforward, and without additional context, it seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this minimal code snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears normal and safe.",
