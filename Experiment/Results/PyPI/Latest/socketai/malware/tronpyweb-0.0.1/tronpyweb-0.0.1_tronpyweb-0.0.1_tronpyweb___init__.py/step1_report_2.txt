  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which reads from a local module file 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this single import statement; no runtime data flow analysis possible here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no unusual patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward import statement importing 'perm' from a local module named 'main'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious data handling. Since it only imports a symbol from a local module, there is minimal risk or malicious intent evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and simply performs a standard import operation. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
