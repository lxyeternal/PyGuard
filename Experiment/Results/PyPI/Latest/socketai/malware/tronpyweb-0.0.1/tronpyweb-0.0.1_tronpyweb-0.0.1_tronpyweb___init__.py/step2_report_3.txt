  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Actual Risks:**\n   - All reports describe the same line: `from .main import perm`.\n   - This is a standard Python import statement, importing `perm` from a local module `main`.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute code dynamically.\n   - Based solely on this snippet, there is no malware, no malicious intent, and no security risk.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - They correctly identify the minimal and safe nature of the import statement.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Malware score:** All assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - **Security risk score:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1 or 0.2). Given the code's simplicity, these are reasonable.\n   - **Confidence levels:** Range from 0.6 to 1, reflecting varying degrees of certainty. Given the simplicity, a confidence of 1 would be justified, but slight variations are acceptable.\n\n4. **Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n   - The highest confidence (1) in report 1 and 5 aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n5. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n   - All correctly indicate no malware and no obfuscation.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code snippet is benign, standard Python import.\n- The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores.\n- No further suspicion or concern is warranted based on this snippet alone.\n\n**Personal Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\nThis assessment is conservative but justified given the evidence.",
