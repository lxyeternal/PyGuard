  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'main' in the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in this line.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only an import statement with no data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only performing an import; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, which is standard in Python for modularization. It imports 'perm' from the local module 'main'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. No external inputs or outputs are involved in this line. As it is only an import, it does not pose any security risks or contain malware. Without additional context, it appears to be normal, benign code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It is likely harmless and standard Python code.",
