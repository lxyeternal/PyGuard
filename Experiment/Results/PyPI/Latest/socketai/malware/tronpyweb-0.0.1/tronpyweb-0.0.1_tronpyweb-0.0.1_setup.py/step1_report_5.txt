  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'tronpyweb' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, defines package dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code primarily defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reads file content for long_description; uses static strings for package info and URL.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools practices for package setup. It reads a local README file for the long description, specifies dependencies ('requests'), and defines package metadata such as name, version, author info, and repository URL. All elements are typical and straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
