{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'tronpyweb' Python package, used to specify package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; reads package metadata such as name, version, author, dependencies, and repository URL.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no external data flows into sensitive operations or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly reads static configuration and file content.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets are present; code structure is standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities, reads a local README file for long description, and defines package metadata including name, version, author, dependencies, and repository URL. All operations are straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious network activity. No external input is processed beyond reading a static file, and dependencies are explicitly listed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply configures package information for distribution without handling untrusted data or executing any external commands.",
