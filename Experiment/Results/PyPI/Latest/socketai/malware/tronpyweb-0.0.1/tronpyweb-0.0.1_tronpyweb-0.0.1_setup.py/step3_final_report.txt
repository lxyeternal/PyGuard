  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library, reading README.md for long description, and specifying package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading local README.md file, static package metadata fields, and dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external code execution points.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and conventional for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and project URL. It reads a local README.md file for the long description. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated code, or external inputs processed. The code does not contain secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency. No anomalies or security concerns are present. The only external resource is the project URL, which appears legitimate. Given the static and benign nature of this script, there is no indication of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script is safe, legitimate, and poses no security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
