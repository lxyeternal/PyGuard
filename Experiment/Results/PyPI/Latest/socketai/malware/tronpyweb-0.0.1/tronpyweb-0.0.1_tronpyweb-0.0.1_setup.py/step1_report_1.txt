  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, defining package metadata, and specifying dependencies and repository URL.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input; the code mainly sets package information and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no suspicious data handling or processing detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns. The email and URL are publicly available data, not secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It reads a local README file, defines package metadata such as name, version, author info, and dependencies. The URL points to a GitHub repository. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward and adheres typical packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
