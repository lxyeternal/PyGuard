  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'quicolor' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and packaging information.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call (package info, dependencies, metadata). No external data input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or data leakage points detected.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code consists of static configuration without data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic imports, code execution, or external data handling. The dependencies are limited to 'requests', which is common and benign. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward and aligns with standard practices for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal, benign setup configuration for a Python package without malicious intent or security risks.",
