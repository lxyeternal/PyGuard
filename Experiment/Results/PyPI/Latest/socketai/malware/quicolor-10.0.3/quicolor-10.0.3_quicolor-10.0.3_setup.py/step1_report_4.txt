  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging the 'quicolor' Python utility, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, packages, install_requires, author, author_email, description, keywords, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no code execution or data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "N/A — the script is a static configuration without data flows or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets (besides generic author info), or obfuscated elements. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script defining package metadata and dependencies. It uses fixed strings and a list of dependencies with no dynamic code or user input processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code execution. The package metadata appears normal, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious URLs. The dependencies are minimal and legitimate. Overall, the script is a typical setup file with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python utility. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
