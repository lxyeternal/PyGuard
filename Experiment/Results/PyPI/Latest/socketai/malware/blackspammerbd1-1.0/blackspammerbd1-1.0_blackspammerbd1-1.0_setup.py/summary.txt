  "conclusion": "The setup script is safe and standard; the primary concern is the package name and the potential execution of malicious code within 'blackspammerbd1.main'. Further review of the 'main' module is recommended before execution. Overall, no malware detected in this code, with a low obfuscation level and moderate risk primarily due to naming."
