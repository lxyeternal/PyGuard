  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry point.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'blackspammerbd1.main:main' upon running the console script.",
  "flows": "User invokes 'bsb' command -> calls 'blackspammerbd1.main:main' -> executes code within main.",
  "anomalies": "Package name 'blackspammerbd1' is suspicious; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The setup script is a typical configuration with no malicious code or obfuscation. The only concern is the package name, which could imply malicious intent, but this cannot be confirmed without inspecting the 'main' module. The code itself is benign, and the entry point's behavior depends on external implementation. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score is moderate (~0.2-0.4) due to the suspicious name but no direct evidence of malicious activity in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is safe and standard; the primary concern is the package name and the potential execution of malicious code within 'blackspammerbd1.main'. Further review of the 'main' module is recommended before execution. Overall, no malware detected in this code, with a low obfuscation level and moderate risk primarily due to naming.",
