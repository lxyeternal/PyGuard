  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The main security concern is potential misuse of the share URL or connection code if exposed publicly. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk ~0.2-0.3) are appropriate. Slightly increasing the overall security risk score to around 0.2 would better reflect the minimal exposure risk without indicating any actual vulnerability."
