  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, likely a placeholder or documentation comment with no operational logic.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code is a comment with no input or data reading mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; there are no data flows, external calls, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; the code contains only a comment, so no data or control flows exist.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a single comment line with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or executable content.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal comment indicating a package initializer. No functions, imports, or executable statements are present. The absence of code eliminates any potential malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The scores across reports are consistent, all assigning zero to malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence due to the simplicity of the code. Given the lack of operational content, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a placeholder comment with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the minimal content.",
