Further review of the 'main' module is recommended before execution. Overall, no malware detected in this code, with a low obfuscation level and moderate risk primarily due to naming."

      "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI tool for managing a local server, with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The subprocess call to start an external server module is the only potential concern, which should be verified separately. The code is clear, straightforward, and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, and the suspicion based on the class name 'BlackSpammerBD' is not substantiated by any malicious code or behavior in this snippet. The scores should remain at zero for malware, with a very low risk score (~0.1) to account for naming suspicion. No obfuscation is present. Overall, the code is safe in isolation, but further review of the 'core' module and 'BlackSpammerBD' implementation is recommended for comprehensive security assessment."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The main security concern is potential misuse of the share URL or connection code if exposed publicly. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk ~0.2-0.3) are appropriate. Slightly increasing the overall security risk score to around 0.2 would better reflect the minimal exposure risk without indicating any actual vulnerability."
