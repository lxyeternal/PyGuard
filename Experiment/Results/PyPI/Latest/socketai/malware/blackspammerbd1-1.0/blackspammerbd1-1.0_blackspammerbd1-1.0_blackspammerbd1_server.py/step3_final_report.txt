{
  "purpose": "Provides a basic Flask server for file listing, download, and upload without authentication or validation.",
  "sources": "request.get_json() for input data, os.listdir('.') for listing files, open() for reading/writing files, base64 decoding/encoding for data transfer.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (open, write), base64 decoding, directory listing, file existence checks.",
  "flows": "Client sends data to endpoints -> server processes data (e.g., filename, base64 data) -> reads/writes files directly based on client input.",
  "anomalies": "No input validation or sanitization for filenames, potential directory traversal via filenames, no authentication, no validation on connection_code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides endpoints for connection validation, file listing, download, and upload. It operates directly on filenames provided by clients without validation, making it vulnerable to directory traversal and misuse. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The server's open nature and lack of access controls pose significant security risks, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The code's behavior aligns with typical insecure file servers, with high potential for exploitation in untrusted environments.",
  "conclusion": "The server is insecure due to lack of validation and access controls, making it vulnerable to misuse, data exfiltration, and directory traversal attacks. However, there is no malicious code or obfuscation detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is high (~0.8).",
