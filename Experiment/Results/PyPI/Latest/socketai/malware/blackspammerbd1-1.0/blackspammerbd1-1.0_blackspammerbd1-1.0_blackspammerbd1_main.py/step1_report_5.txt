{
  "purpose": "CLI tool for managing and interacting with a local server, including starting the server, connecting with a code, listing, downloading, and uploading files.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line arguments (sys.argv), user prompts, and network responses via requests module.",
  "sinks": "Requests POST/GET responses, file write operations, subprocess execution for server start, and printing outputs to terminal.",
  "flows": "Command-line inputs determine function calls; functions perform network requests or file operations; server interactions involve data exchange via JSON and base64 encoding/decoding.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes non-English comment in Bengali about starting the server in background, but no actual suspicious or malicious logic. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. The code dynamically generates an 8-digit connection code, which is typical for session identification. The server is presumed to be local (127.0.0.1). No obfuscated or malicious patterns found.",
  "analysis": "The script is a management CLI that controls a local server process, performs network communication, and handles file transfers with base64 encoding. It uses subprocess to start a server if not running, with standard error/output suppression. The connection code is randomly generated, and network requests are made over HTTP to localhost. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious network activity observed. The code appears benign, with normal file and network operations, and no evidence of data exfiltration, reverse shells, or malicious code insertion. The Bengali comment is a language note, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI management script for local server interactions. It exhibits no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It appears safe and intended for legitimate file and server management tasks.",
