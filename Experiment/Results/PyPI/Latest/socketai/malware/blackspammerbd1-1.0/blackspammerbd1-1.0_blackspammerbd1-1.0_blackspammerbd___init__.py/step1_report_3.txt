{
  "purpose": "Importing the BlackSpammerBD class or function from a local core module.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'core' module relative to the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is visible; only an import statement is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and only contains a relative import; no suspicious or unusual code, secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import of 'BlackSpammerBD' from a module named 'core'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. Since this is only a single line, it doesn't provide any operational logic, data handling, or network activity. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present. The import suggests the class or function may be used elsewhere, but on its own, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a larger project, but by itself, it poses no threat.",
