  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, and the suspicion based on the class name 'BlackSpammerBD' is not substantiated by any malicious code or behavior in this snippet. The scores should remain at zero for malware, with a very low risk score (~0.1) to account for naming suspicion. No obfuscation is present. Overall, the code is safe in isolation, but further review of the 'core' module and 'BlackSpammerBD' implementation is recommended for comprehensive security assessment."
