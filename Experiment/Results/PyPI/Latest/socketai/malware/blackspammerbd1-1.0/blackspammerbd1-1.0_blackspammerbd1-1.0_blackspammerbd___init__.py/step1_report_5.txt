{
  "purpose": "Importing the class 'BlackSpammerBD' from a local module named 'core'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'core' when importing 'BlackSpammerBD'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; just a module import.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement alone provides limited context; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import of a class from a module named 'core'. This is standard Python syntax and does not indicate malicious activity by itself. Without additional context, such as the contents of 'core' or how 'BlackSpammerBD' is used, it is not possible to determine malicious intent. The import statement alone is benign and common in modular Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is minimal and appears to be a normal module import.",
