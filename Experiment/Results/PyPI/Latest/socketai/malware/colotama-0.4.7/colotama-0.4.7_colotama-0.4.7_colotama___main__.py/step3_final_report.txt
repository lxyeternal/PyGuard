  "purpose": "Attempt to import 'pyprettifier' and instantiate 'EmojiConverter'; log import errors to '/tmp/a' if import fails.",
  "sources": "The import statement for 'pyprettifier' and the exception handling block that writes to '/tmp/a'.",
  "sinks": "Writing exception message to '/tmp/a' upon import failure.",
  "flows": "Import attempt → exception raised (if import fails) → error message written to '/tmp/a'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '/tmp/a' for error logging is unconventional; no other suspicious activity or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import with exception handling that logs errors to a temporary file. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logging to '/tmp/a' could be misused but is benign in this context. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscation score 0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2). The confidence levels are high (0.9). No evidence suggests malicious intent or behavior. The code's simplicity and error logging are standard debugging practices, albeit unconventional for production code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minimal security risk stems from error logging to an unconventional location but does not indicate malicious activity. The current scoring accurately reflects this assessment.",
