  "anomalies": "Writing exception details to '/tmp/a' file could be used for exfiltration or logging sensitive errors; no other suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'pyprettifier' and create an EmojiConverter object. If the module is missing, it catches ImportError and logs the exception message to '/tmp/a'. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution. The error logging to a temporary file is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious; it may be for debugging or error tracking. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code's main function is to attempt a module import and handle failure by logging the error. There is no malicious behavior or malware present. The use of '/tmp/a' for logging is somewhat unconventional but not suspicious on its own. Overall, the code appears benign.",
