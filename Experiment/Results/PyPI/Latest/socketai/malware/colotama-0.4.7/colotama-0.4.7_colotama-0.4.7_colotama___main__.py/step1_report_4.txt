  "purpose": "The code attempts to import a package and instantiate an object from it, and in case of import failure, logs the error to a file.",
  "sources": "The import statement for 'pyprettifier' and the exception handling block that writes to '/tmp/a'.",
  "sinks": "Writing error details to '/tmp/a' in case of ImportError.",
  "flows": "If 'pyprettifier' fails to import, the exception message is written to '/tmp/a'.",
  "anomalies": "The code writes import error messages directly to a file in '/tmp'. No malicious behavior detected, but the error logging approach is unusual and could potentially be misused for logging sensitive info if expanded.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function 'after_install' that tries to import the 'pyprettifier' package and instantiate 'EmojiConverter'. If the package is missing, it catches the ImportError and appends the error message to '/tmp/a'. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The error logging to '/tmp/a' is unconventional but not inherently malicious. The code performs a simple check and logs errors without executing any suspicious commands or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It performs a basic import check and logs import errors. The overall security risk is low.",
