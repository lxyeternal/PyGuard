{
  "purpose": "Import the 'cli' function or object from the 'colotama' package's 'cli' module, likely for command-line interface setup.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the package's internal module 'cli'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, straightforward import statement; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py file that imports 'cli' from a sibling module. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The import is standard Python module syntax and does not suggest malicious intent. Since this file only performs an import, it does not contain any harmful or malicious code. The absence of additional code or functionality further reduces suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module initialization file that imports a 'cli' component; no malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
