{
  "purpose": "Import the 'cli' object or function from the local 'cli' module during package initialization.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .cli import cli' reads the 'cli' object from the local 'cli' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code only performs a static import.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the local 'cli' module to the package namespace via import; no data flows or external interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement in a __init__.py file, typical for exposing CLI commands or components. It does not process data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity. The security of the overall package depends on the contents of the 'cli' module, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization file that imports a 'cli' component. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concern evident from this snippet. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
