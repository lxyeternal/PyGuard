  "purpose": "Import the CLI command from the cli module, likely for exposing command-line interface functionality.",
  "sources": "The code imports from the '.cli' module, which could contain functions that handle user input or commands.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or command executions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this snippet, as it only performs an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement that imports 'cli' from a local module. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modifications. The simplicity and lack of side effects suggest no malicious behavior or security issues. The only potential concern could be the contents of the 'cli' module itself, but based on this snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement with no apparent malicious or security issues. It simply exposes CLI functionality from a local module.",
