  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign configuration with no malicious or obfuscated code. The main security concern is the execution of the 'petace' module code via the CLI, which could be malicious if the module is compromised. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2). Overall, the setup script itself is safe; the actual security risk depends on the content of the 'petace' module, which is outside the scope of this review."
