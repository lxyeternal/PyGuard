  "conclusion": "The code is not explicitly malicious but employs techniques (obfuscation, SSL bypass) often associated with malicious activity. It warrants monitoring, especially if the URL or server behavior is suspicious. The current scores reflect moderate suspicion, with malware risk adjusted to 0.4 to better align with the suspicious indicators."
