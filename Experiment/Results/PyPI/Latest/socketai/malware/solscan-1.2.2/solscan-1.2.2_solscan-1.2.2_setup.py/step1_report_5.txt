{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'solscan', used for packaging and distribution of the Solana Blockchain Tracking and Analysis Toolkit.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file with specified UTF-8 encoding.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations; no external network or sensitive data handling is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'README.md' file read operation into the 'long_description' parameter of setup().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools components, reads a README file with UTF-8 encoding, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. The code performs typical package configuration without any dynamic code execution, external network calls, or handling of untrusted input beyond file reading. No malicious code, backdoors, or security risks are present. The read of README.md is benign and necessary for package description. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
