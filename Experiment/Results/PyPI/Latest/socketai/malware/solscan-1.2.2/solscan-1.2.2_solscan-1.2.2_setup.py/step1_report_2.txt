{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'solscan' with its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file with specified UTF-8 encoding",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected; setup process uses fixed values and dependencies only",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' and passing static configuration to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed; the code performs standard package setup tasks",
  "analysis": "The script reads a markdown README file using UTF-8 encoding, then calls setup() with package metadata, dependency list, and classifiers. All data used is static or sourced from the filesystem in a safe manner. No user input, environment variables, or network interactions are involved. The dependencies and metadata appear standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
