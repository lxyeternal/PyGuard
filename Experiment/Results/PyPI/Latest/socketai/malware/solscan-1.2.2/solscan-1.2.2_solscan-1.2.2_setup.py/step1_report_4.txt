{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'solscan' Python package including reading the README file and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or malicious effects present",
  "flows": "Read from file to variable 'long_description'; use of setup() with package metadata and requirements",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script opens 'README.md' with UTF-8 encoding to read the long description, then calls setup() with package metadata including name, version, author info, description, and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behavior are present. The use of 'find_packages' and standard setup parameters aligns with typical package configuration. There are no source-to-sink data flows that could lead to security issues. Overall, the code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities.",
