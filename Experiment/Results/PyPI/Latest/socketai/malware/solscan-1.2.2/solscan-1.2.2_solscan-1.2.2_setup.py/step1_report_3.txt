  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'solscan' Python project, including reading the README.md for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description content.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data transmission is present.",
  "flows": "Reading file -> storing content in 'long_description' -> passing it to 'setup' function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no suspicious code or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for a Python package. It reads the README.md file with specified UTF-8 encoding, then calls 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved beyond the static file read. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. The dependencies are straightforward and do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the script performs expected packaging tasks with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It is safe for use and does not contain malware or obfuscated code.",
