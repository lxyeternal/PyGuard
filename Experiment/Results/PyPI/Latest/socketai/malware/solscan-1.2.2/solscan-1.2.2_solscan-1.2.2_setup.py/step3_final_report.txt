  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' with UTF-8 encoding; static metadata in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reading file -> setup() call with static data; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard setup script with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads a documentation file and configures package parameters. It contains no dynamic or malicious operations, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and static nature justify high confidence in the benign assessment. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code aligns with best practices for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
