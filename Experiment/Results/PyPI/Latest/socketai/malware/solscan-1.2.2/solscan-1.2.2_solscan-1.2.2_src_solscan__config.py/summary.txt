  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk behavior characteristic of malicious supply chain activity or remote code execution. It downloads and executes external binaries without validation, with SSL verification disabled, making it highly susceptible to exploitation. The pattern indicates potential malicious intent, warranting a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9."
