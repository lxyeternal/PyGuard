{
  "purpose": "Downloads a ZIP file from a remote URL, extracts it, and executes 'config2.exe' without validation, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "sources": "HTTP response content, ZIP file extraction, presence of 'config2.exe' in extracted directory",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing 'config2.exe' directly from remote download",
  "flows": "Download ZIP -> Save to temp directory -> Extract ZIP -> Locate 'config2.exe' -> Execute 'config2.exe'",
  "anomalies": "Disabling SSL verification (`ssl=False`), no checksum or signature validation of downloaded content, silent cleanup, execution of remote binary without validation",
  "analysis": "The code downloads a ZIP file from a hardcoded URL with SSL verification disabled, which exposes it to MITM attacks. It extracts the ZIP and runs 'config2.exe' directly without any validation or integrity checks, representing a high-risk pattern associated with supply chain attacks or malware deployment. The process is silent on errors, which could hide malicious activity. The straightforward nature of the code and its behavior strongly suggest malicious intent, especially given the lack of validation and remote execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk behavior characteristic of malicious supply chain activity or remote code execution. It downloads and executes external binaries without validation, with SSL verification disabled, making it highly susceptible to exploitation. The pattern indicates potential malicious intent, warranting a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9.",
