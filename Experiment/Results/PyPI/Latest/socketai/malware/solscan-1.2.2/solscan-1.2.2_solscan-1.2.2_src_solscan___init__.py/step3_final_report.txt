  "flows": "From the invocation of _refresh_runtime() in _background_init() to any external network or system effects",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; standard event loop handling",
  "analysis": "The code defines an async function that calls an external setup function, managing the asyncio event loop correctly to run this during module import. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The primary uncertainty is the behavior of _refresh_runtime(), which could involve network requests or configuration changes. Given the code's clarity and standard structure, no malicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified, considering the external dependency. Without evidence of malicious activity, the overall risk remains low, and the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard async setup with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the external function call, but in the absence of evidence, it could be slightly lowered. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. Overall, the code is safe based on the provided snippet.",
