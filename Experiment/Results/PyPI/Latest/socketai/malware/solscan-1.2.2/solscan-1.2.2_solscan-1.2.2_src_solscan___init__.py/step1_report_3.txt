{
  "purpose": "The code initializes runtime configuration asynchronously and exports certain modules and functions for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules from the same package (.core, .utils, ._config) and calls an asynchronous function _refresh_runtime()",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations",
  "flows": "The code asynchronously calls _refresh_runtime() during module import, ensuring runtime configuration is refreshed, but no data flows from external sources into sensitive operations",
  "anomalies": "The code uses asyncio to conditionally run an asynchronous initialization function based on the event loop state, which is standard practice; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules and asynchronously initializes runtime configurations if not already running an event loop. It handles event loop scenarios properly by checking asyncio.get_event_loop().is_running() and either running or scheduling the _refresh_runtime() coroutine accordingly. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data leaks, is evident. The structure is typical for asynchronous setup code. The presence of __all__ and __version__ suggests standard package behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard asynchronous initialization and module exports with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a Python package setup.",
