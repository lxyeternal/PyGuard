  "purpose": "Initialize runtime environment asynchronously during module import, exposing core functions and utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.core, .utils, ._config), asyncio for asynchronous operations.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; initialization functions may perform background tasks.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> conditional asyncio event loop check -> run background initialization -> expose functions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses asyncio to run background initialization depending on event loop state, which is standard; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines an async function for background initialization that calls '_refresh_runtime'. It then checks if an asyncio event loop is running; if not, it runs the init function with asyncio.run(). If an event loop is active, it schedules the init function to run in a thread-safe manner. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The code performs environment setup asynchronously, which is a common pattern in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard asynchronous initialization for a package, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It simply prepares runtime environment components in the background during import.",
