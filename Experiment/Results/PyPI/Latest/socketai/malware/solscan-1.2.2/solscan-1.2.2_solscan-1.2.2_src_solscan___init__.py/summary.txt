  "conclusion": "The code is standard async setup with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the external function call, but in the absence of evidence, it could be slightly lowered. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. Overall, the code is safe based on the provided snippet."
