  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description, uses find_packages() to locate packages, and specifies dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input processed; static data only.",
  "flows": "No dynamic code execution or data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no suspicious or malicious constructs. It reads static files, declares dependencies, and uses standard functions. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or network activity is present. The use of open() without error handling is common in setup scripts and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe, standard nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
