{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script is used for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'foop'.",
  "sources": "Reads package dependencies from 'install_requires', reads the long description from 'README.md', and gathers package information via 'find_packages()'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; the code does not process external input at runtime, only reads static files and package metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; dependency list and file reading are static and safe.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code follows standard setup.py conventions with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, specifies package info, dependencies, author details, and reads a README file for the long description. All operations are typical for package setup. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not execute any untrusted input, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py file appears to be a legitimate, standard package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
