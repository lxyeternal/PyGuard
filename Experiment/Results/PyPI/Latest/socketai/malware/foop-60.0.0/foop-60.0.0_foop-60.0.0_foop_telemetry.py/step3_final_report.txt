  "purpose": "Collects system information such as hostname, IP, platform details, and current directory, then sends this data via HTTP POST to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), socket.getfqdn(), platform.* functions, os.* functions, datetime.utcnow()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to the webhook URL with JSON data",
  "flows": "Data collected from system info functions flows into the JSON payload, which is then sent via requests.post() to the webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward. The default webhook URL is a placeholder, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system info and sends it to a webhook endpoint. It uses standard libraries with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The default URL is a testing endpoint, not indicative of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The data flow is simple and transparent. No suspicious code behaviors or anomalies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign telemetry utility designed for system info reporting. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
