  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to a specified webhook URL for telemetry purposes.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname), socket.getfqdn(), platform.* functions, os module, datetime.utcnow(), requests.post()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending data to webhook_url; potential data leakage if webhook_url is malicious or compromised",
  "flows": "System info gathered via _get_system_info() and then sent via requests.post() with data as JSON payload",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of default webhook URL could be suspicious if it was dynamically set, but static here; no obfuscation or unusual code structures",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Telemetry class that collects various system details such as hostname, IP address, platform info, Python path, current working directory, and timestamp. It then sends this data as a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a webhook URL. The data collection uses standard libraries without suspicious or malicious code. The default webhook URL is a placeholder (https://webhook.site/foob), which suggests it's for testing or demonstration purposes, not malicious. There are proper exception handlers and logging. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The main concern could be the unintentional collection and transmission of system information, but this aligns with telemetry intent rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system telemetry by collecting system info and sending it over HTTP, with no evident malicious intent or malware. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are present. It appears to be a benign telemetry utility, assuming the webhook URL is controlled or monitored by the user.",
