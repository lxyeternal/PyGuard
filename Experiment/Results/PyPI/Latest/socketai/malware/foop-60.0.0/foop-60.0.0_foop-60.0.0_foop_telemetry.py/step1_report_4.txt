  "sinks": "requests.post() to send data to the webhook URL",
  "flows": "Sources (system info functions) -> collect_and_send() -> requests.post() (data transmission)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials other than the webhook URL (which is configurable), no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no unusual or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system information such as hostname, IP address, FQDN, platform, OS details, Python path, package path, current working directory, and timestamp. It then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a specified webhook URL. The webhook URL is set to a default value but can be configured externally, indicating flexibility. No malicious actions such as data theft, unauthorized system access, or malware behavior are present. The code performs straightforward telemetry collection without any suspicious or hidden code activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign telemetry collection for system information reporting. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The only concern is the potential for data leakage if the webhook URL is misused, but this is typical for telemetry systems. Overall, no malicious intent or malware detected.",
