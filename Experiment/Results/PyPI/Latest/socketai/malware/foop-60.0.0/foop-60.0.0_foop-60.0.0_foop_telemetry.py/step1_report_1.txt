  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to a specified webhook URL for telemetry purposes.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), socket.getfqdn(), platform.* calls, os.* calls, datetime.utcnow(), requests.post()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() (sending data to external URL), potential logging of errors",
  "flows": "System info collection via _get_system_info() -> data packaging -> requests.post() to webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded default webhook URL ('https://webhook.site/foob'), no user input sanitization, no validation of data before sending, error logs are written but no further checks",
  "analysis": "The code gathers detailed system information including hostname, IP, FQDN, platform details, OS version, Python path, package path, current working directory, and timestamp. It then sends this data via HTTP POST to a specified webhook URL. The default webhook URL appears to be a placeholder ('https://webhook.site/foob'), which is a common testing endpoint, not malicious by itself. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as data theft, system modification, or network attacks. It primarily collects and reports system info, which is typical for telemetry modules. The use of try-except blocks helps prevent crashes but does not obscure behavior. There are no indications of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration beyond standard telemetry. Overall, the functionality appears legitimate and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system telemetry and reporting without any malicious intent. It uses standard libraries and methods, and the default webhook URL is a placeholder for testing. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It is a typical telemetry implementation.",
