  "purpose": "Initialize telemetry tracking when the package is imported.",
  "sources": "The import statement for '.telemetry' and the instantiation of the Telemetry class.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data sinks or external communications are visible in this code.",
  "flows": "Import of telemetry module -> creation of Telemetry object -> telemetry initialized upon package import.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard practice for initializing telemetry.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Telemetry class from a local module and instantiates it immediately upon import, which is typical for telemetry or analytics collection. There are no hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or network operations visible. The version string is standard. Without seeing the implementation of Telemetry, it cannot be confirmed whether it performs malicious activities, but this file itself appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply initializes a telemetry object during package import without any evident malicious behavior. It is a standard pattern for enabling telemetry tracking, assuming the Telemetry class performs legitimate data collection.",
