  "purpose": "Initialize telemetry collection when the package is imported.",
  "sources": "Importing the Telemetry class from the telemetry module and instantiating it.",
  "sinks": "The instantiation of the Telemetry object could potentially be a sink if it performs network communication or data collection upon creation.",
  "flows": "Import .telemetry -> create Telemetry instance -> initialize telemetry data collection.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Telemetry class and creates an instance immediately upon module import, likely for tracking or data collection purposes. The __version__ attribute is set to '60.0.0', which is typical. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. However, the instantiation of Telemetry could perform network activity or data collection; without inspecting the Telemetry class implementation, this cannot be confirmed. The code itself appears benign but has potential privacy or security implications depending on Telemetry implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code initializes telemetry collection on import, which could involve data transmission depending on the Telemetry class. No malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies are directly evident, but the potential for data collection warrants consideration. Overall, the code is straightforward with no overt security issues.",
