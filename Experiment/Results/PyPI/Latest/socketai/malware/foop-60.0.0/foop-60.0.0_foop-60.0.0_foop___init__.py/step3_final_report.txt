  "purpose": "Initialize telemetry for monitoring purposes upon package import.",
  "sources": "Import of Telemetry class from local module; instantiation of Telemetry object.",
  "sinks": "Potential network communication or data collection within Telemetry class (not visible here).",
  "flows": "Import -> Telemetry() instantiation (possible internal network or data flow depending on implementation).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward initialization. No obfuscation or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Telemetry class and creates an instance immediately, which is typical for telemetry setup. No network calls, data leaks, or obfuscation are visible. The behavior depends on the implementation of Telemetry, which is not provided. The code is benign and standard for such purposes. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's clarity and lack of suspicious patterns. The main uncertainty relates to what Telemetry does internally, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The potential security risk depends on the internal implementation of Telemetry, but from this snippet alone, it appears safe. The scores assigned are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk (~0.1-0.2).",
