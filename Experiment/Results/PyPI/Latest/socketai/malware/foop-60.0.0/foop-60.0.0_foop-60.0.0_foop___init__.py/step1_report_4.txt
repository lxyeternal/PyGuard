  "purpose": "Initialize telemetry tracking when the package is imported",
  "sources": "Importing Telemetry class from telemetry module, instantiating Telemetry object",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data output or network activity directly visible",
  "flows": "Importing Telemetry -> Creating telemetry instance on import",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code; straightforward initialization",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named Telemetry from a local module and initializes it upon import, likely to track usage or behavior. The __version__ attribute is set to a static string. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or hidden behavior. The simplicity and clarity suggest intended telemetry functionality, which is common in open-source packages. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard telemetry initialization pattern without malicious intent or security risks.",
