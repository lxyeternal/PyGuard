  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward initialization",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Telemetry class and instantiates it immediately upon import. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The Telemetry object may collect data, but this is a common practice for package usage tracking, assuming proper privacy disclosures. No external network connections or sensitive data handling is visible here.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard telemetry initialization with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
