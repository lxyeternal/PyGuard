  "purpose": "Initialize telemetry object upon package import, likely for monitoring or analytics.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing Telemetry class from telemetry module; instantiation of Telemetry object.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network operations or data storage are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Import -> Instantiate Telemetry object during module load.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. The code straightforwardly initializes a telemetry object.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Telemetry class and creates an instance immediately upon module import, which is a common pattern for initializing telemetry or logging. The version string is set to '60.0.0'. There are no network calls, data leaks, or suspicious code behaviors present. The purpose appears to be for monitoring purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign and solely responsible for initializing telemetry tracking when the package is imported. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
