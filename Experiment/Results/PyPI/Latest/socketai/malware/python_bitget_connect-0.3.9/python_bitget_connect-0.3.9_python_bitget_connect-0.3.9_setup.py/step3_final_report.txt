  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and read README.md for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file via open('README.md').read()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are used or affected",
  "flows": "File read operation from local filesystem; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without exception handling; no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setup, defines package metadata, and reads a local README.md file for description. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and no security risks. The only minor concern is the unguarded open() call, which is standard in setup scripts and not malicious. The scores are consistent with the straightforward, safe nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or scoring adjustments are necessary.",
