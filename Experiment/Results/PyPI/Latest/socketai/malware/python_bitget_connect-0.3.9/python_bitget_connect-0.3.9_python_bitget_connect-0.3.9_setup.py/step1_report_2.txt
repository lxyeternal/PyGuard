  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package called 'python-bitget-connect', intended to facilitate packaging and distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or perform network or system actions.",
  "flows": "The only data flow involves reading a local file ('README.md') for the long description during package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present. Usage of standard setup() parameters and straightforward file reading without dynamic or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, reads the README for description, and sets packaging classifiers. No code injection, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors are present. The reading of 'README.md' is a common practice and does not introduce risk. All elements are typical for package configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
