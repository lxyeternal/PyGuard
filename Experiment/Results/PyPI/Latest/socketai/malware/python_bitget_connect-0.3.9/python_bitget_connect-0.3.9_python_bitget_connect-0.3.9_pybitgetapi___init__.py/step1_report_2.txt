  "purpose": "Initialize package and potentially execute remote code or scripts based on OS.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ), hardcoded strings, and shell commands via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing encoded PowerShell commands or remote script download and execution.",
  "flows": "Environment and hardcoded strings -> shell commands executed via subprocess -> remote code downloaded and executed.",
  "anomalies": "Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads and executes code, remote URL fetching binary, potential obfuscation, use of shell=True in subprocess.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally executes different payloads based on OS. On Windows, it decodes a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that writes and runs a script file, then deletes it. The script appears obfuscated, likely to hide malicious intent. On POSIX systems, it downloads a binary from a remote URL, sets permissions, and runs it in the background. Use of shell=True and remote code execution indicates high security risk. The code exhibits obfuscation and executes external, untrusted code, characteristic of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell commands and remote binary download and execution, indicative of malicious intent. It aims to execute remote or hidden scripts based on OS, posing a significant security threat.",
