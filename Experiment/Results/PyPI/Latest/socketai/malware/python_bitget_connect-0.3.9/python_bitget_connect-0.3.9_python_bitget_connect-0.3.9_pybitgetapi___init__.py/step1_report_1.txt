{
  "purpose": "Initialize the package and execute platform-specific code, potentially downloading and executing external scripts or binaries.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), subprocess commands, base64-encoded strings, external URLs (Dropbox).",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() commands executing potentially malicious code, output files written to user directories, downloads executed without validation.",
  "flows": "Base64-decoded script executes via PowerShell (Windows), downloaded binary executed on POSIX systems.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell commands that download and execute remote scripts, use of obfuscated base64 string, remote URL download, execution without validation or checksum, cleanup commands, direct execution of downloaded files.",
  "analysis": "The code checks OS type. On Windows, it decodes a base64 string intended to run via PowerShell, which downloads and executes remote content, then cleans up. The base64 string appears to be encoded malicious PowerShell script. On POSIX systems, it downloads a binary from a remote URL and executes it, with no integrity check. The code lacks validation, error handling, or security controls, indicating potential malicious activity such as remote code execution, malware download, or backdoor installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote scripts/binaries without validation, indicating a high risk of supply chain compromise or malware. The obfuscated PowerShell payload and remote binary download suggest intent to compromise systems.",
