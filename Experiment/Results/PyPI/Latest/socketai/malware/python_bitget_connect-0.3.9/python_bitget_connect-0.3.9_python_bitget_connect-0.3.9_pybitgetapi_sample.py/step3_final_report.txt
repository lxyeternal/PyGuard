  "purpose": "A simple addition function with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'a' and 'b' used as input data.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the sum; no external data sinks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow directly into the return statement without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic addition function with no external dependencies, no obfuscation, and no side effects. All reports confirm its simplicity and benign nature. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not interact with external systems, handle secrets, or perform unsafe operations. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's characteristics. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the code's clarity and simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward addition function with no security risks or malicious intent. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or scoring adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
