  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for Python project distribution.",
  "sources": "Static metadata in setup() call, including package name, version, author info, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed or output.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with static package metadata. It imports only necessary functions, calls setup() with hardcoded values, and does not perform any dynamic operations, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. Confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty in the benign nature. No anomalies or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
