  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, static setup script for a Python package using setuptools.\n- The code imports only from 'setuptools', calls 'find_packages()' and 'setup()' with hardcoded, static metadata.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data handling, network calls, or file I/O are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 and a malware score of 0, indicating they see no malicious intent.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: a typical setup.py script.\n- The reported issues are accurate: the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no anomalies or errors are apparent.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, given the benign nature.\n- The risk scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- Since all reports agree and the code is a typical setup script, there are no indications of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is detected.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk is zero, which is appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, safe setup.py script.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:**\n- The code is benign; no further action required.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as a benign, standard setup script with no security issues. The scores and reasoning are appropriate and consistent.",
