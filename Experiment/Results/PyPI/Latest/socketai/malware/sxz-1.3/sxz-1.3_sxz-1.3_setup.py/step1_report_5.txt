  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'sxz'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it uses static metadata for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not perform any data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The script is a standard setup configuration with no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. All elements are typical for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools and calls setup() with static parameters defining package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, external input handling, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a straightforward package setup script. No indicators of malicious intent or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
