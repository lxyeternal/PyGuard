  "flows": "N/A — no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious patterns observed. The code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools and uses them to define package configuration including name, version, author, email, description, and classifiers. All elements are typical for a Python package setup. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
