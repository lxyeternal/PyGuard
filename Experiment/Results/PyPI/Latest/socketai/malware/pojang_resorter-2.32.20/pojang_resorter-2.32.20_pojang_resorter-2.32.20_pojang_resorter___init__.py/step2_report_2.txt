  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code in question:**\n- It consists of a module docstring, an import statement (`from .main import main`), and metadata variables (`__version__`, `__author__`).\n- There are no input/output operations, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.\n- The import is from a local module, which is standard in package setup.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code is simple and does not contain any malicious or suspicious logic.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities or attack vectors are apparent.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- They emphasize the absence of malicious activity, which is correct.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal or no security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- The high confidence scores (mostly 1) are justified given the simplicity and benign nature.\n- No report overstates the risk; all correctly identify the code as safe.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a minimal, standard package initialization file with no security concerns.** There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis.",
