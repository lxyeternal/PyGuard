  "purpose": "Minimal package module defining metadata and importing main functionality",
  "sources": "Import from local module '.main', metadata variables '__version__' and '__author__'",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Import statement and variable assignments; no runtime data flow or external communication",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initialization module with a docstring, an import from a local module, and metadata variables. It contains no input/output, network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities is consistent with the code's simplicity. The malware score is appropriately zero, as is the obfuscated score and security risk score. No anomalies or suspicious signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard package initialization file with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0.",
