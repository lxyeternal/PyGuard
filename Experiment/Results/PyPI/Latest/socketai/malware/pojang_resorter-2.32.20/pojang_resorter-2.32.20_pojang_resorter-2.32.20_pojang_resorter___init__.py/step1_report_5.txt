  "purpose": "Provides metadata and entry point for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool",
  "sources": "Imports 'main' from the current package",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to untrusted sources or external systems",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified, as the code only imports and sets metadata",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or suspicious constructs; only metadata and import statement",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing a function from a local module and defining package metadata. There are no sources of untrusted input, no sinks that process external data, and no flows connecting sources to sinks. The code appears to serve as a simple package initializer or metadata container, with no suspicious or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as a package metadata and entry point setup, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
