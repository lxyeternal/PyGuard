{
  "purpose": "The code defines metadata for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, including importing the main function and setting version and author information.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the import statement from a local module (.main), and the assignment of version and author strings.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the import and variable assignments are static and safe.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing a local main function and defining metadata variables. It does not process user input, network data, or perform any operations that could be malicious. The import is from a relative module, which is standard in package structure. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as package metadata and module import statements. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
