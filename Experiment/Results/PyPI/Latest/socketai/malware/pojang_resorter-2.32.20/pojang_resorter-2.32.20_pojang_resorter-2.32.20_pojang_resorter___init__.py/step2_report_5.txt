  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal package module with:\n  - A docstring describing the package.\n  - An import statement: `from .main import main`\n  - Metadata variables: `__version__` and `__author__`\n- No other logic, data processing, user input, network activity, or external communication.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Presence of reported issues:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code only contains import statements and metadata variables. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reports:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly note the absence of data flows, sinks, sources, anomalies, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores and their reasonableness:**  \n  - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n  - The obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the clear, straightforward code.\n  - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n  - Confidence scores are mostly 1, indicating high certainty, which is justified.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  - The reports assume that importing from a local module and setting metadata is harmless, which is reasonable.\n  - No assumptions about malicious intent are made beyond the code's content, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware and risk justification:**  \n  Since there's no malicious code, external communication, or suspicious behavior, malware and risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n\nGiven the simplicity of the code, there's no reason to adjust the scores. All reports are consistent with the code's nature. The only potential concern might be the import of `main` from a local module, but without further context or code from `.main`, there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                      |\n| Security Risk   | 0                      |\n\n**The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent evident.**",
