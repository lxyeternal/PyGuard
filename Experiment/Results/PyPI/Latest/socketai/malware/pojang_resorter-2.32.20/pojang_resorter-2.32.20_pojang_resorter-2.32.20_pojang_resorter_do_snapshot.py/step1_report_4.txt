  "purpose": "Decode and execute a base64-encoded, zlib-compressed payload.",

  "sinks": "exec() function that executes the decompressed code.",
  "flows": "Reverse the input string → base64 decode → zlib decompress → execute the code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda function to perform decompress and decode; immediate execution via exec() on decompressed payload.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an anonymous lambda function '__' that performs base64 decoding followed by zlib decompression on a reversed string input. The input string is reversed (__[::-1]), then base64 decoded, then decompressed. The resulting payload is executed immediately via exec(). The code appears to obfuscate its intent by reversing the string and compressing it, which is common in malicious payloads to hide behavior. The decompress-and-execute pattern is a red flag, as it is often used to hide malicious scripts or payloads. No other suspicious library usage or hardcoded secrets are observed, but the immediate execution of decompressed data indicates a high risk of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to obscure and execute a hidden payload, which is highly suspicious. The pattern of decoding, decompressing, and executing arbitrary code suggests malicious intent. Due to the obfuscation and behavior, it should be considered potentially malicious with high confidence.",
