{
  "purpose": "Decodes and executes base64-encoded, zlib-compressed code, likely to run obfuscated payload.",
  "sources": "Input data provided in the variable passed to the lambda function, which is a large base64 string.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded and decompressed code via exec() function.",
  "flows": "Base64 string -> reversed -> decoded -> decompressed -> executed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of reversing the string, base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and dynamic execution (exec). These are common obfuscation techniques to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that reverses the input string, decodes it from base64, and decompresses it with zlib. The provided string appears to be an obfuscated payload that, once decoded, may contain malicious instructions. The immediate execution via exec() indicates high risk, as this allows arbitrary code execution without visibility into payload content. The obfuscation steps (reversing, decoding, decompressing) are typical in malicious scripts aiming to evade detection. No other library calls or data leaks are evident, but the method of hiding code and executing it dynamically is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious due to obfuscation and dynamic execution, strongly indicating malicious intent. It is designed to hide payloads and execute them at runtime, which is typical of malware or malicious scripts.",
