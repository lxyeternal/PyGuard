{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pojang_resorter', including dependencies, entry points, and compatibility requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies in 'install_requires' and package metadata from the setup call.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the setup script primarily declares dependencies and package info.",
  "flows": "No dynamic or runtime data flows are present; static package setup declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed. All dependencies are common for GUI and image processing tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to specify package information, dependencies, and entry points. Dependencies include various libraries for GUI automation, image processing, HTTP requests, and Windows-specific operations, all typical for a desktop application. No code execution, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python application with multiple dependencies related to GUI automation and image processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this module.",
