  "purpose": "The code is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'pojang_resorter', specifying dependencies, entry points, and Python version requirements.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data directly; dependencies listed are standard package requirements. No source code or user input is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this setup script. It only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; this script does not process runtime data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. All dependencies are common Python packages, and the setup configuration is standard.",
  "analysis": "This is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, console entry points, and Python version compatibility. No code execution, network communication, or runtime data handling occurs here. All listed dependencies are typical for GUI automation, image processing, network requests, and testing, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical setup script for a Python project, with no anomalies, malware, or security issues detected.",
