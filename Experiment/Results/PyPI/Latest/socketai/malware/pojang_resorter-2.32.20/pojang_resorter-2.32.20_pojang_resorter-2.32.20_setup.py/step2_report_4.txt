  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report finds no malicious or suspicious elements. The dependencies are common, and the code is a straightforward setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the standard nature of dependencies and setup code, with no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, noting that dependencies like 'requests', 'pycurl', 'aiohttp', and 'discord.py' could be used for network communication, but the setup script itself does not perform such actions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — slightly elevated security risk due to potential network activity, but no direct malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Since the setup could enable the package to perform network operations at runtime, assigning a small security risk score (0.2) is reasonable, but not indicating malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, with a focus on the absence of runtime data handling or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — very low, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard setup script with no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code. The setup script is purely declarative.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present in the code.\n- **Risk Score:** Given that the setup dependencies include libraries capable of network communication and system manipulation, but the setup script itself does not perform any such actions, a very low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified.\n\n### **My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk due to dependencies that could be exploited if misused, but no actual malicious activity or vulnerabilities in the setup code itself.\n\n**Summary:** The setup script is standard, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The slight security risk score reflects the potential for the dependencies to be used maliciously at runtime, but the setup code itself remains benign.",
