  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the dependencies, and the context.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It's a standard `setup.py` script using setuptools.\n- Declares package metadata: name, version, entry points.\n- Specifies dependencies (`install_requires`) including `pillow`, `pyautogui`, `requests`, `discord.py`, `gitpython`, `opencv-python`, `pycurl`, `pywin32`, `aiohttp`, `numpy`, `pygetwindow`, `pyscreenshot`, `scipy`, `pytest`.\n- Sets Python version requirements (`>=3.10,<3.13`).\n- Defines a console script entry point.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code itself is straightforward and standard.\n- No runtime logic, no code execution, no dynamic behavior.\n- No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n- Dependencies are common in automation, image processing, GUI, and network tasks.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears benign and does not contain malicious code or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** No issues, dependencies are reputable, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No changes needed.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as Report 1, standard setup, dependencies are typical.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, noting network-related dependencies (`requests`, `pycurl`, `aiohttp`, `discord.py`) which could be used maliciously.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to potential network activity, but nothing suspicious in the setup script itself)\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Verdict:** The caution is reasonable. The code itself does not perform network operations; these dependencies are declared but not executed here. The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, emphasizes that no runtime data or code execution occurs here.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. No malicious activity.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates the standard nature of the setup, no anomalies.\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that this is a standard setup script with common dependencies.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The only slight concern is the inclusion of network-related libraries (`requests`, `pycurl`, `aiohttp`, `discord.py`), but these are declared dependencies, not active code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** For the overall package, considering only the setup script, a low risk score of 0 is justified. Slightly higher scores (e.g., 0.2) could be assigned if there was concern about the dependencies, but in this context, it's not necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| **0** | **0** | **0** |\n\nThe package setup is standard, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the runtime code (the actual implementation in `pojang_resorter.main:main`) for any malicious behavior, as setup scripts alone do not execute code beyond installation metadata.",
