  "purpose": "Defines package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and Python version requirements for the 'pojang_resorter' package.",
  "sources": "Dependency list in 'install_requires', package metadata, and entry point declaration.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data sinks; only dependency declarations and setup configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows or runtime code execution; purely static setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools, with a list of common dependencies for GUI automation, image processing, and network operations. No runtime logic, data handling, or malicious patterns are evident. Dependencies like 'requests', 'pycurl', 'aiohttp', and 'discord.py' could perform network activity but are typical for such projects. No obfuscation or suspicious code structures are detected. The dependency list and setup configuration are benign and typical for the described functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The presence of network-related dependencies does not imply malicious intent, especially since no runtime code is included here. The overall security risk is minimal, and the package appears safe for use.",
