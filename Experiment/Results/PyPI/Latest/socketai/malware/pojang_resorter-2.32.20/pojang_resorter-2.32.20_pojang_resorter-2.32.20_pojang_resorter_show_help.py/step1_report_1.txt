  "purpose": "Display a help message with ASCII art and colorized output for a CLI tool that accepts specific commands.",
  "sources": "The script reads command-line arguments through argparse to determine which command to display help for.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; output is solely console-based.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> argparse parser -> display help and ASCII art output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The ASCII art and color codes are standard for enhanced CLI presentation. No dynamic code execution or external network interactions are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines a function to show help with ASCII art and colored output, and executes this function if run as main. It strictly manages command-line arguments to display help information. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code is straightforward and intended for user interface purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This script is benign, serving solely to display styled help information for a CLI tool. It does not contain malicious code or suspicious behaviors.",
