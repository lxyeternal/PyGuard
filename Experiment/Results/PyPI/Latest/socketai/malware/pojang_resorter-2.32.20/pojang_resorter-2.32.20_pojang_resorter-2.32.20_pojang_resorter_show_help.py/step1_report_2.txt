{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface (CLI) with help and command options for the Pojang Resorter system.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments (sys.argv), specifically the 'command' argument parsed by argparse.",
  "targets": "The command-line arguments are used to determine program behavior but do not process or execute untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "User provides command via CLI -> argparse parses the command -> script displays help information or ASCII art accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; use of ASCII art and colored output is cosmetic. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'show_help' that displays ASCII art, colored headers, and argument help. It uses argparse for command parsing, which is standard. The code is straightforward, with no data being read from untrusted sources other than command-line arguments. No functions or behaviors indicate malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden operations. No obfuscation, malware, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI helper script with no signs of malicious behavior. It primarily displays ASCII art and help messages based on user commands, with no suspicious or harmful operations.",
