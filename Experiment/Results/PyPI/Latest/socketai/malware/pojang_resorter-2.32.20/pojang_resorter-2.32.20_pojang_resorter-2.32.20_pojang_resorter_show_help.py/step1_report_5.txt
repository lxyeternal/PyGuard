{
  "purpose": "Display help information with ASCII art and command-line options for a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine the command to execute.",
  "sinks": "Prints ASCII art and help text to standard output; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "User inputs command-line arguments -> argparse processes input -> program displays ASCII art and help info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ANSI escape sequences for colors is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines a function to display ASCII art and help info with color formatting, and invokes this function if run as main. The argparse setup defines commands but does not execute or invoke any dangerous behavior. There are no data leaks, code injections, or external communications. The code is straightforward and appears benign, serving only as a CLI help display.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a CLI help display with ASCII art and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It reads user input minimally for help commands and outputs formatted help text, posing no security concern.",
