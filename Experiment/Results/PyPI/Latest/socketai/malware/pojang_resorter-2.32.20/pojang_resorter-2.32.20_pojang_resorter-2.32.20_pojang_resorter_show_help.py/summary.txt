  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI help utility with no malicious or security risks. It solely displays ASCII art and help info with no external interactions or vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments are accurate; the only minor overestimation is report 5's security risk score of 0.1, which should be adjusted to 0. The overall code is safe and non-malicious."
