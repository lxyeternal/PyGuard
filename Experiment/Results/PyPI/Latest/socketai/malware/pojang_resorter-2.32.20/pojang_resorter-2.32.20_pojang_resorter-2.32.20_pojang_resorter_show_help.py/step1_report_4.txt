  "purpose": "Display help information with ASCII art and command options for a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; prints output to terminal.",
  "flows": "User input (command argument) flows through argparse to determine command usage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. ASCII art and colored output are purely cosmetic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines a function to display help info with ASCII art and colored text, and sets up argument parsing for specific commands. There are no external network connections, data leaks, or malicious code. The ASCII art and color codes serve aesthetic purposes only. The code performs a straightforward help display without processing sensitive data or executing commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help display script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
