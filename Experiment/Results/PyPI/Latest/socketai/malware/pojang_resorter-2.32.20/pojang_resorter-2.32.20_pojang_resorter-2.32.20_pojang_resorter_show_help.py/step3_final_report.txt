  "purpose": "Display ASCII art and command help information for a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "User input via argparse command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Console output (print statements). No external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input commands parsed by argparse lead to display functions; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines a function to print ASCII art and colored help info, and invokes it if run as main. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or execute commands beyond displaying help. The ASCII art and color codes are cosmetic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The command choices are benign, and the code's purpose is purely for user interface.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI help utility with no malicious or security risks. It solely displays ASCII art and help info with no external interactions or vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments are accurate; the only minor overestimation is report 5's security risk score of 0.1, which should be adjusted to 0. The overall code is safe and non-malicious.",
