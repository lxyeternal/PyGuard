The presence of network-related dependencies does not imply malicious intent, especially since no runtime code is included here. The overall security risk is minimal, and the package appears safe for use."

      "conclusion": "The code pattern indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity due to heavy obfuscation and dynamic execution of unknown payloads. All reports correctly identify these aspects and assign high risk scores. The overall assessment is that this code should be treated as malware with a malware score of approximately 0.95, obfuscation around 0.9, and security risk near 0.95. It warrants immediate review and sandbox analysis of the payload."

The reports' assessments are accurate; the only minor overestimation is report 5's security risk score of 0.1, which should be adjusted to 0. The overall code is safe and non-malicious."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including downloading a suspicious executable, establishing persistence, and executing without validation. The behavior is characteristic of malware such as data stealers or remote access trojans. The high malware score (1) and security risk (1) are justified given the evidence. No obfuscation is detected. The overall assessment indicates a high probability of malicious intent with significant security implications."

No malware or obfuscation is present. The risk score is moderate, depending on external script integrity. Overall, the code is safe if external scripts are maintained securely. Final scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2-0.4."
