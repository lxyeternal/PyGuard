  "purpose": "Provides local logging of function calls and external notification via a webhook with system info.",
  "sources": "Function calls, system home directory via Path.home()",
  "sinks": "Requests.post to a hardcoded webhook URL transmitting system info",
  "flows": "Function execution triggers logging and external POST request; data flows from function call to external endpoint",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, external request with minimal validation, no input sanitization",
  "analysis": "The code sets up local logging and an external notification mechanism via a hardcoded webhook URL. The external request transmits system info (home directory) with a timestamp, which raises privacy concerns. No malicious payloads, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The webhook URL is publicly visible, which could be exploited for privacy violations or covert monitoring, but the code itself does not perform malicious actions. The exception handling suppresses request errors, reducing attack surface but not eliminating privacy risks. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in functionality but exposes privacy and security concerns due to the hardcoded webhook URL and external data transmission. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily from potential misuse of the exposed URL, but no active malicious behavior is detected.",
