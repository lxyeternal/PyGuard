  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing EmojiConverter class and all contents from logger module.",

  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import 'from .logger import *' can be considered a potential anomaly as it can lead to namespace pollution and obscure imported content; however, it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initialization script that imports a class and all symbols from a logger module. No input reading, network activity, or data manipulation occurs here. The use of wildcard import is notable but not suspicious on its own. No signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic import operations with no malicious behavior detected. The only minor concern is the use of wildcard import, which is a style issue rather than a security risk.",
