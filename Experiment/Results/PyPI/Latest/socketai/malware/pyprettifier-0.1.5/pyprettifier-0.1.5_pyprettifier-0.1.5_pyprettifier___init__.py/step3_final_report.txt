  "purpose": "Package initialization script importing EmojiConverter and logger modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements: from .emoji_converter import EmojiConverter, from .logger import *",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A; only static imports without data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import 'from .logger import *' as a style concern, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The wildcard import is a style issue, potentially causing namespace pollution, but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (~0.2) due to style concerns. The code is typical for package initialization and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard module initializer. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The minor concern about the wildcard import does not translate into a security risk. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
