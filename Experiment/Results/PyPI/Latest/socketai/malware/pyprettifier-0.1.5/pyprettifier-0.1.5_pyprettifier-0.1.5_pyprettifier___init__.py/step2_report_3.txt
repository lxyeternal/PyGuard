  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple package initializer, performing only import statements.\n- The only potential anomaly noted is the use of `from .logger import *`, which can cause namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of data flow from untrusted sources, network activity, or data sinks.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's presence of issues:\n- The code is straightforward, with no active code execution, data processing, or external communication.\n- The wildcard import `from .logger import *` is a style concern but not malicious.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The only notable flaw is the use of `import *`, which can lead to namespace pollution and obscure imported symbols. This is a style or maintainability issue, not a security flaw.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis; no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0.2 or 0, with the minor concern about wildcard import, but overall, the risk is minimal.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No issues justify a risk higher than 0.2, as no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The scores of 0.2 reflect a minor concern about namespace pollution, but not a security threat.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' findings; no discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (keeping the minor namespace pollution concern in mind)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, serving only as a module initializer with no malicious or security issues. The only concern is the style of import, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Set the security risk score at around 0.1, reflecting a minor style concern but no security threat.",
