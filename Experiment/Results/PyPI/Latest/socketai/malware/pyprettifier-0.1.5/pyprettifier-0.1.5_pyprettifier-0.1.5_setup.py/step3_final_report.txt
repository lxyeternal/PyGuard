  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading static README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sources processed.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md as text; no data flow leading to execution or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static file read and setup call.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports setuptools, reads a static README.md file for the long description, and calls setup() with package info, dependencies, and Python version requirements. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted input. The only file read is a static markdown file, which is safe. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices indicate no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assess its safety, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0. The overall security posture is safe, and no further action is needed.",
