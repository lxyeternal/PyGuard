{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the Python package 'pyprettifier', including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, package metadata, and dependencies declared in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to or reads from untrusted sources at runtime; no external data flows or untrusted input processing is present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow identified; the script primarily reads static files and defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. Usage of standard setuptools setup process; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for package setup, reads the README.md file for the long description, and calls setup() with package metadata and requirements. No dynamic code execution, no network calls, no handling of untrusted data, and no potential backdoors or malicious behavior are evident. The code follows a standard pattern for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The provided script is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only reads static files and sets package metadata without external data flow or suspicious activity.",
