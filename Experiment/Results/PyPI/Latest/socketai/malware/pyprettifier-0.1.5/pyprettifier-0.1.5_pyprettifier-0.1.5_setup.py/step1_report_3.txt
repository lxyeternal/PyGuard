{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'pyprettifier' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the filename for 'README.md' content, and importing modules such as setuptools and pathlib.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations that could be malicious.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are present; the setup process uses static metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, reads a local README.md file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All actions are standard for Python package setup scripts. No code execution based on external input, no network connections, and no suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
