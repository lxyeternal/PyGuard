{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'pyprettifier', specifying metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the file 'README.md' for long description, and the setup configuration data such as package info, author details, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if 'README.md' is malicious or contains malicious code, reading its content could lead to executing malicious scripts if the content is later evaluated. However, in this context, it's only read as text and not executed.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' (source) flows into the 'long_description' variable, which is then passed to setup, but no malicious flow is detected as the content is not executed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The code uses standard setuptools functions, with no obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup.py for packaging. It imports necessary modules, reads the README.md for description, and calls setup() with package metadata and requirements. All operations are standard and safe. No hidden or malicious code is present. No external data is fetched dynamically or executed. The only file read is a markdown file, used solely for documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely provides package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
