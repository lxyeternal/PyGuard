{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'pyprettifier'. It defines metadata and dependencies for the package.",
  "sources": "Reading the file 'README.md' for long description content.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md file (source) is used for the long description in setup (sink). The flow is straightforward and only involves file reading for metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no network connections or data exfiltration points.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads a markdown file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All operations are standard for a Python package setup. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are evident. The code lacks any input handling beyond reading a static file, and no external data is processed during runtime.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard and benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
