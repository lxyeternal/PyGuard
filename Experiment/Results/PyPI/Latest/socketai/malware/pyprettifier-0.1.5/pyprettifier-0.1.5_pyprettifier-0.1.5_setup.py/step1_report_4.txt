  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'pyprettifier' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the contents of 'README.md' file from the package directory.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks; no untrusted data or external output that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Reads file content into 'long_description' variable; no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to configure package metadata, dependencies, and description. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, which is typical in package setup scripts. No code performs network activity, data leaks, or other malicious behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious injections. The code structure and content follow conventional practices for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
