      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation without verification or user consent. This pattern is characteristic of supply chain attacks or malware distribution. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The code should be considered unsafe, and the package should be flagged accordingly."
