{
  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (USER/USERNAME), reading /etc/resolv.conf, executing 'ls /' command, reading /etc/passwd, getting hostname and current directory, platform info.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to a remote server ('https://eowthx8teol6a3s.m.pipedream.net') sending collected data.",
  "flows": "Sources (environment variables, files, system commands) flow into data collection variables, which are then assembled into a payload and sent via an HTTP POST request.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects sensitive system files (/etc/passwd), directory listings, and environment data, then exfiltrates it to an external URL during installation, which is suspicious behavior. No user input validation or safeguards. Uses broad exception handling which suppresses errors, potentially hiding malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers detailed system information including hostname, username, DNS servers, directory listings, passwd file contents, OS info, and current working directory. It then sends this data to an external URL. The collection of sensitive files (/etc/passwd), system info, and exfiltration during package install indicates potential malicious activity or privacy invasion. The code does not perform any validation or restrictions, and the data collection is comprehensive. This behavior aligns with data exfiltration tactics often used in malicious software.",
  "conclusion": "The script exfiltrates detailed system information to an external server during package installation without user consent. This pattern is characteristic of malicious data theft or spyware. The code appears designed to surreptitiously gather and send system info, representing a significant security concern.",
