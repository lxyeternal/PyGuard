  "analysis": "The code gathers system details including hostname, username, DNS servers, directory listings, and contents of '/etc/passwd'. It then assembles this information into a JSON payload and sends it via an HTTP POST request to an external URL. The data collection occurs automatically during package installation without user approval. The inclusion of sensitive files like '/etc/passwd' and environment variables indicates potential malicious intent for data harvesting or espionage. There are no obfuscation techniques or complex logic, but the behavior strongly resembles data exfiltration or malicious surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "This script exhibits suspicious activity by collecting extensive system information and sending it to an external server without user consent. The inclusion of sensitive files and system data indicates potential malicious intent or security compromise. It should be flagged for review and possible removal from the package.",
