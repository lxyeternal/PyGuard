  "purpose": "Collects system information, including hostname, username, DNS servers, directory listing, passwd contents, and system details, then exfiltrates this data via HTTP POST during package installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (USER, USERNAME), '/etc/resolv.conf', '/etc/passwd', 'ls /' command, 'os.getcwd()', platform.system(), platform.release()",
  "sinks": "requests.post to external URL ('https://eowthx8teol6a3s.m.pipedream.net')",
  "flows": "Source data (system info, files, environment variables) collected and passed into payload, then sent via HTTP POST to external server",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data collection during package install, reading sensitive files (/etc/passwd), executing system commands without validation, broad exception handling suppressing errors, no user notification or consent",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system data and exfiltrates it automatically during package installation, which is privacy-invasive and suspicious. It accesses files like /etc/passwd, runs 'ls /', and sends data externally without user awareness. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present, but the behavior resembles spyware or data theft. The broad exception handling hides errors but does not negate malicious intent. The exfiltration of sensitive data during install is a high-severity privacy violation, characteristic of malware or spyware. The malware score should reflect high malicious potential, but not necessarily active malicious payloads. The security risk score is justified as high due to privacy invasion and data exfiltration. Overall, the code's behavior warrants a high malware and security risk assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert collection and exfiltration of sensitive system data during package installation, resembling malicious spyware activity. While it lacks active payloads or obfuscation, its behavior is highly suspicious and privacy-invasive. The malware score should be set around 0.75-0.9, and the security risk score around 0.8-0.9, indicating high threat level. The code should be flagged for review and potential removal due to privacy violations and security concerns.",
