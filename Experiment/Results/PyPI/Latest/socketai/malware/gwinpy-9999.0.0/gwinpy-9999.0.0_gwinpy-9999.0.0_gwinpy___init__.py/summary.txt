  "conclusion": "The code performs covert collection and exfiltration of sensitive system data during package installation, resembling malicious spyware activity. While it lacks active payloads or obfuscation, its behavior is highly suspicious and privacy-invasive. The malware score should be set around 0.75-0.9, and the security risk score around 0.8-0.9, indicating high threat level. The code should be flagged for review and potential removal due to privacy violations and security concerns."
