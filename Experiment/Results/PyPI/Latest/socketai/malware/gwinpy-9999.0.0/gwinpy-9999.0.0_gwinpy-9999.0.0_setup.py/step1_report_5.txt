  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'gwinpy' Python package, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data: package name, version, description, author info, dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted input handling or data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual version number '9999.0.0' may indicate placeholder or misconfiguration, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script defining package metadata and dependencies. No user input or untrusted data is processed. The dependency on 'requests' is typical for HTTP operations. The high version number might be unconventional but does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script with no malicious behavior. The only unusual aspect is the version number, which likely is a placeholder or for internal testing. No security risks or malware indications are detected.",
