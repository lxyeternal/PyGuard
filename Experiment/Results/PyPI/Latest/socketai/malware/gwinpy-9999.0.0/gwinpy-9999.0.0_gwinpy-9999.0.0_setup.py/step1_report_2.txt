  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'gwinpy' Python package, specifying its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata for the package (name, version, description, author, email) and the list of required dependencies ('requests').",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows from sources to sinks; all data is static or predetermined within the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The version number '9999.0.0' is unusually high and non-standard, which could be suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present. No obfuscated or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration script, using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. The version number is atypical but not malicious. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The only anomaly is the unusually high version number, which is not inherently malicious but could be considered suspicious. Overall, the package appears safe.",
