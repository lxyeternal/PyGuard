  "purpose": "Define and configure the 'gwinpy' Python package for distribution, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call reads static data such as package name, version, description, author info, package list, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "There are no dynamic inputs or untrusted data sources that could lead to data leaks or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static literals into the setup() function, which processes package configuration. No user input or untrusted data is involved.",
  "anomalies": "The version number '9999.0.0' is unusually high and non-standard, possibly indicating an attempt to mask or denote a custom or pre-release version. No other anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package setup script utilizing setuptools. It contains no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no suspicious imports or behavior. The only notable aspect is the non-standard version number, which may be intentional for internal versioning or placeholder purposes. No malicious or security-risk behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The unusual version number does not indicate malicious intent but is worth noting for version management.",
