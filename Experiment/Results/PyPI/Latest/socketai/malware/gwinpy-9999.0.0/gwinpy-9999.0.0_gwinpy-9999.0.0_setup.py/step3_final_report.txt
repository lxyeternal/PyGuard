  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration for 'gwinpy' with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields: name, version, description, author, author_email, packages, install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sources present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unusually high version number '9999.0.0', which is non-standard but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script defining package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code, user input, or suspicious imports are present. The only notable aspect is the high version number, which could be a placeholder or internal marker. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores. The anomalous version number does not introduce security vulnerabilities but may be used for internal purposes. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. The scores are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The high version number is unusual but not harmful. Existing reports accurately reflect this assessment; no changes are necessary.",
