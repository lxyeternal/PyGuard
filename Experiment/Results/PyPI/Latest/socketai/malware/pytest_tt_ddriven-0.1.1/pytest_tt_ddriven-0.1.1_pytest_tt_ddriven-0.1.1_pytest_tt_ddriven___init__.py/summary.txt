  "conclusion": "The code exhibits patterns typical of malicious or covert data collection scripts, primarily due to URL obfuscation, SSL verification bypass, and external communication. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, these behaviors are suspicious and warrant caution. The malware score should be increased to reflect the potential for malicious activity, and the security risk score remains high due to insecure SSL and obfuscation."
