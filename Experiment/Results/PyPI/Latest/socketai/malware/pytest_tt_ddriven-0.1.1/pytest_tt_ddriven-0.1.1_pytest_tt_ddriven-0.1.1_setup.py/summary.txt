  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration file. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The only consideration is the runtime execution of an external module, which could be malicious if compromised, but this is outside the scope of the setup script. Therefore, the code is safe, with a very low security risk due to potential external module behavior."
