{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pytest-tt-ddriven', including metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "import statement for setuptools; setup() function parameters including package name, version, author info, description, packages, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "Entry point command 'pytest-tt-ddriven' executing 'pytest_tt_ddriven:pytest_tt_ddriven' function.",
  "flows": "Code reads package metadata and defines an entry point; the command line execution calls the specified function in the package.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code structures. The setup script appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools to define a package setup. It specifies package metadata, including author info and a console script entry point. The entry point maps a command-line command to a function within the package. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The code structure and content are typical for Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a package configuration file, with no suspicious or harmful code present.",
