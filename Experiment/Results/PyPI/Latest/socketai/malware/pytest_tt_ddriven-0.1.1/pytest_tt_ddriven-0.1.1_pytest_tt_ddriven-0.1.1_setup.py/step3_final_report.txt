  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration defining package metadata and entry point.",
  "sources": "Imports setuptools, uses find_packages(), defines entry point 'pytest-tt-ddriven=pytest_tt_ddriven:pytest_tt_ddriven'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the function 'pytest_tt_ddriven' in the 'pytest_tt_ddriven' module when the console script is run.",
  "flows": "The console script invokes 'pytest_tt_ddriven' from 'pytest_tt_ddriven' module at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code present; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, defines package metadata, discovers packages with find_packages(), and sets up a console script entry point. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies. The only potential concern is that executing the console script runs a function from an external module, which could be malicious if that module is compromised. However, this risk is external to the setup script itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) is justified to reflect the runtime risk associated with executing external code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration file. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The only consideration is the runtime execution of an external module, which could be malicious if compromised, but this is outside the scope of the setup script. Therefore, the code is safe, with a very low security risk due to potential external module behavior.",
