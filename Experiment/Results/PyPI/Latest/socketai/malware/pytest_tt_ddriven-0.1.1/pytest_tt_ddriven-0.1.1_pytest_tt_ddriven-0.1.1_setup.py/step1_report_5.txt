{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the pytest-tt-ddriven Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads package name, version, author info, description, package list, and entry point definitions from hardcoded strings and function calls.",
  "sinks": "Uses find_packages() to discover packages; sets entry point 'pytest-tt-ddriven' which executes pytest_tt_ddriven.py module/function.",
  "flows": "Configuration data (name, version, author, description, packages, entry points) flows into the setup() function, which processes it for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation. The email domain is external but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, discovers packages via find_packages(), and defines a console script entry point. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external connections or malicious behavior detected. The setup script appears typical for Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py code is benign, following standard packaging practices without malicious intent. It does not exhibit signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks.",
