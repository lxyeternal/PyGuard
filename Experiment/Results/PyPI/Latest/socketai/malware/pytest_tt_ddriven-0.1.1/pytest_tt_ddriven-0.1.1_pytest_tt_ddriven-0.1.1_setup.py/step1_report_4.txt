{
  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'pytest-tt-ddriven' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Package metadata (name, version, author, description), find_packages() to locate package modules, and entry_points for console script creation.",
  "sinks": "The console script 'pytest-tt-ddriven' execution point: 'pytest_tt_ddriven:pytest_tt_ddriven'.",
  "flows": "Setup configuration reads package info; the entry point executes the function 'pytest_tt_ddriven' from the 'pytest_tt_ddriven' module when the command is run.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code strictly adheres to standard setup configuration patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, discovers packages via find_packages(), and creates a console script entry point. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present. The entry point points to a function within a module, but without code from 'pytest_tt_ddriven', no malicious behavior can be inferred. Overall, the script appears benign and typical of Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a normal setup configuration script for a Python package with a console script entry point. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for package distribution.",
