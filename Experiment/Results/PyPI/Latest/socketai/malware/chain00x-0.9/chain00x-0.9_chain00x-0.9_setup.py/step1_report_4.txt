{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script with a custom install command.",
  "sources": "Requests to an external URL (https://py.chain2.eyes.sh/) in the CustomInstall.run() method.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call could be a sink if it is used to exfiltrate data or connect to malicious domains.",
  "flows": "The run() method in CustomInstall initiates a GET request to the specified URL during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code that captures system information (hostname, cwd, username) but does not execute; only the GET request remains active, which could be used for tracking or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports standard packaging libraries and defines a CustomInstall class overriding the run() method. The run() method currently makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain, which could be used to track or communicate with a malicious server during installation. The commented-out code suggests prior or intended functionality to collect system info, but it is inactive. The request to an untrusted domain during package installation is suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes, such as user tracking or command and control communication. No other malicious code or obfuscated behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains a suspicious network request during installation, indicating potential malicious intent, such as tracking or command and control. The code does not perform any other malicious actions or obfuscation. The request to an external, non-trusted domain during package setup warrants caution.",
