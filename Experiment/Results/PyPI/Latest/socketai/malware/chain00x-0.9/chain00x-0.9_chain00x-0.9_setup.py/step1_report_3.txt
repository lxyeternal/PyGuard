{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation class that performs an HTTP GET request to an external URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; it also imports modules like requests, socket, getpass, and os.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call to 'https://py.chain2.eyes.sh/' during the custom install run method could be a sink for data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.",
  "flows": "Upon installation, the CustomInstall.run method is executed, triggering an HTTP GET request to the specified URL, which could facilitate data transfer or trigger malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "The run method is commented out for some standard setup commands, but it performs a network request without any user input or validation. The URL 'https://py.chain2.eyes.sh/' is suspicious as it is not related to package installation and may be malicious or maliciously controlled.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging with setuptools, with an overridden install command that executes a GET request to an external URL during installation. The commented code hints at gathering system info (hostname, cwd, username), but these are not currently used. The URL accessed is suspicious, and making network calls during install can be used for malicious purposes like malware delivery, command-and-control communication, or user tracking. No other malicious code or hardcoded credentials are present. The external request is the primary anomaly, as it can be used maliciously or covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform a network request to an external, potentially malicious URL during package installation. While the current code does not exfiltrate data or execute malicious payloads explicitly, making network calls during install is suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes or tracking. Overall, the package should be considered risky due to this behavior.",
