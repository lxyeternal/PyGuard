      "conclusion": "The package performs a suspicious external network request during installation to an obscure URL, which could be used for tracking or malicious command-and-control. No direct payloads or malicious code are present, but the behavior is suspicious enough to warrant caution and further investigation. The scores should reflect a low to moderate malware likelihood and a moderate security risk due to the network activity."
