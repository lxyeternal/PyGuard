  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, considering the details provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports standard modules and the 'requests' library.\n- Immediately makes a GET request to `http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsglueml` during module import.\n- Defines a `post_install()` function that repeats the same request.\n- Implements a custom install command (`PostInstallCommand`) that runs `post_install()` after installation.\n- The setup script uses this custom command, resulting in network requests during both import and installation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of external network requests:** The code makes outbound HTTP GET requests to `http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsglueml` during import and post-install, which is suspicious.\n- **Potential privacy/security concern:** Repeated contact with an external, suspicious domain (`pov.sh`) without clear purpose.\n- **Behavior atypical for benign setup scripts:** Standard setup scripts do not perform network communication during import or install.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- **All reports agree** on the suspicious external requests, their timing, and the potential malicious intent.\n- **Over-interpretation risk:** The reports assume malicious intent based solely on external contact, but without evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration, this remains an inference.\n- **No evidence of obfuscation or malicious payloads:** The code is straightforward, and the network requests are unconditioned, unencrypted, and hardcoded.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score (~0.75 - 0.9):** Justified. Repeated contact with a suspicious domain during import and install suggests malicious or at least privacy-invasive behavior.\n- **Obfuscated (~0):** Correct. The code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score (~0.6 - 0.75):** Justified. The behavior is suspicious and could be malicious, warranting a high security risk score.\n\n### Specific Observations:\n- The **malware score** should be **higher** than 0.75, closer to 0.9, because:\n  - Contact with a suspicious domain during critical phases (import and install).\n  - No legitimate reason provided for these requests.\n  - No evidence of benign functionality or user consent.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains 0, which is accurate.\n- The **security risk** should be **around 0.8** or higher, considering the repeated external contact.\n\n### Potential Flaws in the Reports:\n- The reports lean heavily toward maliciousness but lack concrete evidence of payloads or exfiltration.\n- They assume malicious intent from external contact alone, which, while suspicious, is not definitive.\n- The reports could benefit from noting that, without additional malicious payloads or behavior, this could be an overly cautious but still suspicious setup.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** **0.9**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0.8**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code makes repeated, unconditional requests to a suspicious domain during import and installation, which is highly unusual and suspicious. While no direct malicious payloads are present, this pattern strongly indicates malicious or privacy-invasive behavior, justifying high malware and risk scores.\n\n**Recommendation:** Treat this package as malicious or at least highly suspicious, and further investigation should be conducted before any deployment.",
