{
  "purpose": "To define and install a Python package named 'awsglueml' with a custom post-install action that makes an HTTP request.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'README.md' for the long description and makes HTTP GET requests to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsglueml'.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP GET requests to an external server, potentially leaking information or causing unwanted network activity.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install command triggers 'post_install', which sends a GET request to the specified external URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code makes an external HTTP request during installation without any apparent purpose, which is unusual and could be malicious. The URL used ('pov.sh:45111') appears suspicious. No other suspicious code behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a package setup with a custom post-install step that makes a GET request to an external server. This request is hardcoded and occurs during installation, which is atypical for benign packages. The request could be used to track installations, exfiltrate information, or connect to a command-and-control server. No other malicious activities, such as code injection or backdoors, are present. The overall behavior suggests potentially malicious intent due to the external contact during setup, especially given the suspicious URL. However, the code itself is straightforward and not obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard package setup but includes an unusual and potentially malicious external HTTP request during installation. The request to an obscure URL raises concerns about privacy or malicious control. Overall, it has a high likelihood of malicious intent and security risk.",
