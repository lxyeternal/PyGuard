  "conclusion": "The package exhibits highly suspicious behavior through repeated external requests to a known suspicious domain during import and installation phases. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, the pattern strongly indicates malicious or privacy-invasive activity. The scores should reflect high malware (around 0.85) and security risk (around 0.8), consistent with the observed behavior."
