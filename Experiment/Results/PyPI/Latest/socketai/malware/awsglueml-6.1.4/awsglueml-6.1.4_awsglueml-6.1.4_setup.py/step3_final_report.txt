{
  "purpose": "The code makes external HTTP GET requests to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsglueml' during import and post-installation, likely for malicious tracking, command-and-control, or data exfiltration purposes.",
  "sources": "The 'requests.get' calls at module import time and within the 'post_install()' function executed during setup.",
  "sinks": "The external server 'pov.sh:45111' receives the GET requests, potentially capturing system or user data, or enabling remote control.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (the GET requests) originate at import and post-install phases, reaching the external server without validation or user consent.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated unconditional GET requests to a suspicious domain during both import and installation, with no legitimate purpose or user interaction.",
  "analysis": "The code performs immediate external contact during import and setup, which is unusual and suspicious. The requests target a domain that appears malicious or at least untrusted. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads detected. The repeated contact suggests potential tracking, command-and-control, or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (around 0.75-0.9 for malware, 0.6-0.8 for security risk) are justified given the behavior. The high confidence stems from the suspicious external communication pattern, which is a common indicator of malicious intent in supply chain contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits highly suspicious behavior through repeated external requests to a known suspicious domain during import and installation phases. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, the pattern strongly indicates malicious or privacy-invasive activity. The scores should reflect high malware (around 0.85) and security risk (around 0.8), consistent with the observed behavior.",
