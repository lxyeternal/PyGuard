{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that installs a package and executes a post-install action involving an HTTP request to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long_description; the 'requests' library is used to make HTTP GET requests to a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "The remote URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsglueml) receives GET requests during the initial import and during the post-install process; no data is sent from the local environment.",
  "flows": "Import triggers an HTTP GET request; post_install() also performs the same request; no other data flow or input handling is observed.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated GET request to a suspicious domain during module import and post-install; no validation or error handling for the request; no obvious purpose other than contacting a remote server; the URL and the function name suggest possible malicious intent or tracking.",
  "analysis": "The script executes an HTTP GET request to a potentially malicious domain both upon import and during installation. The request is hardcoded and unconditionally executed, which could be used for tracking, command and control, or exfiltration of data. The rest of the code is standard setup and packaging code with no other suspicious activity. The code does not perform any other malicious actions such as data theft, privilege escalation, or system modifications beyond the remote request. However, the remote contact to an obscure domain during installation is a strong indicator of malicious or at least suspicious behavior, potentially used for tracking or malicious command control. No obfuscation or code complexity suggests malicious concealment. The repeated remote call without clear purpose is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior involving contacting a remote server during import and installation, which could be malicious. The purpose appears to be tracking or external command control. The overall security risk is high due to this behavior, with potential privacy or security implications.",
