{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that performs a network request during installation",
  "sources": "requests.get() call at the beginning of the script, within the post_install() function",
  "sinks": "Network request made to http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsglueml, potentially leaking information or establishing contact with an external server",
  "flows": "Code executes requests.get() immediately upon script load, and again during post-installation, establishing outbound connections to the specified server",
  "anomalies": "Repeated network request to an external server during module import and installation; no clear legitimate reason for this behavior; no validation or encryption of data sent or received; usage of hardcoded URL and port",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, then performs an immediate HTTP GET request to an external server (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsglueml) outside of any conditional or user input. It defines a post-install function that repeats this request after installation, which is invoked via a custom install command class. This behavior indicates the code contacts an external server during both import and installation, potentially for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or tracking. No other suspicious code or malicious behavior is present. Usage of requests to contact a hardcoded server is a common tactic in malicious packages for establishing control or gathering information, especially when no legitimate reason is provided.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized external network communication during package import and installation without clear purpose, which strongly suggests malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior. The repeated contact to an external server with no user control indicates a high security concern. Therefore, this package should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious.",
