  "purpose": "The code imports various functions and variables from a local module named 'modules' and defines package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; just imports and metadata assignment",
  "anomalies": "Simple import statement; no suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement from a relative module and two metadata variables (__version__ and __author__). There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The import is straightforward and common in Python packages. No external data sources, environment variable usage, or network activity observed. No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module import with package metadata. No malicious intent or security risks identified based on this snippet.",
