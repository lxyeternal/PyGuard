{
  "purpose": "The code imports multiple functions from a local module (.modules) and defines package metadata (__version__, __author__).",
  "sources": "The import statement from .modules and the definitions of __version__ and __author__.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process user input or external data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only performs static imports and variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with standard import and metadata definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a local module and defines package metadata variables. It contains no dynamic code execution, no user input handling, and no external data flows. The imported functions suggest cryptographic or message handling functionalities, but their presence alone does not indicate malicious intent. The code is typical for package setup or initialization. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with benign package setup code. The confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The risk is minimal, primarily because the code only performs static imports and metadata definitions. No further action is necessary based solely on this snippet.",
