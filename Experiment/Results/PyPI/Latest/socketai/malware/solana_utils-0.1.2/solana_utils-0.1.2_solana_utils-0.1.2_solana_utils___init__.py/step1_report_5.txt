  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module import statement and metadata definition for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local package (relative import), and module-level metadata variables (__version__, __author__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or handle untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs import and variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module directory and sets metadata variables. There are no input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external data interactions. The import paths and variables are standard for Python packages. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payload, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import and metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
