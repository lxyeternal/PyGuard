  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible from this limited code, as it only imports functions/variables without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and variables from a local module, indicating modular design. No user input, external data sources, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The presence of version and author metadata is standard for package identification. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with metadata declarations, showing no malicious intent or security risks based on this fragment.",
