  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple import statement from a local module (`.modules`) and defines package metadata (`__version__`, `__author__`).\n- They consistently conclude that there are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious code, and no security risks based solely on this snippet.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0), indicating that the reviewers are quite certain about their assessments.\n- Malware scores are all 0, and obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Code\n- The code is a standard Python module import statement and metadata declaration.\n- No dynamic code execution, no user input handling, and no external data flows are present.\n- The imported functions seem related to message handling, signing, verification, and transaction processing, which are typical in blockchain or cryptographic applications.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports.\n- The analysis is consistent and thorough, considering potential risks but finding none.\n\n### Scores and Justifications\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the lack of malicious indicators.\n- The security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1 or 0), aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n- Since the code is purely import statements and metadata, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n### Potential Risks or Assumptions\n- The only potential concern is the imported module `modules`. If that module contains malicious code, it could pose a risk, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n- The reports correctly note that the import itself is not suspicious.\n\n### Consistency and Recommendations\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation\nGiven all the information, my assessment aligns with the reports:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard package setup; no security concerns)\n\n**Note:** If the imported `modules` contain malicious code, that would change the risk profile, but based solely on this snippet, the risk remains negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, benign package initialization fragment with no malicious or security issues evident. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
