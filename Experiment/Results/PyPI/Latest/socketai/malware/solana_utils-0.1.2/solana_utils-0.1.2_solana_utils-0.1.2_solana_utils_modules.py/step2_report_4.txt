  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations from the code:**\n\n- The code contains multiple placeholder functions related to message creation, signing, verification, but these are mostly empty or return static data.\n- The critical function `confirm_transaction` constructs a message that includes the wallet's secret key (converted to hex) and sends it via Telegram API.\n- The Telegram bot token and chat ID are hardcoded within the function.\n- The wallet's private key is exposed in plaintext over the network, which is a severe security concern.\n- No actual transaction signing or blockchain logic is performed; the focus appears to be on transmitting sensitive data.\n- The malware score is high, and the security risk is very high, consistent with malicious exfiltration behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility module for blockchain transactions, with a suspicious `confirm_transaction` that leaks private key via Telegram.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the private key leak and the malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.75, SecurityRisk 0.9 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly flags malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues with the report's reasoning or scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar, with focus on blockchain message creation and a function that leaks private key.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly points out the leakage of private key over Telegram API, high security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.75, SecurityRisk 0.8 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriately flags the behavior as malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines functions for message handling and transaction confirmation, with a focus on the `confirm_transaction`.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the leakage of private key via Telegram and the hardcoded token/chat ID.\n- **Scores:** Malware 1, SecurityRisk 1 — justified given the exposure of secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar, with focus on the `confirm_transaction` leaking private key.\n- **Analysis:** Highlights the security risk and malicious potential.\n- **Scores:** Malware 1, SecurityRisk 1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly flags the behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar, noting the exfiltration of private key via Telegram.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the hardcoded secrets and the leakage.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.75, SecurityRisk 0.8 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriately identifies malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n\n- The malware scores are consistently high (0.75 to 1), reflecting malicious exfiltration.\n- Security risk scores are also high, matching the severity.\n- The reports are consistent with the code behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The core issue is the deliberate leakage of private key via an unencrypted, hardcoded Telegram API call.\n- The functions are mostly placeholders, but the `confirm_transaction` function's behavior is clearly malicious.\n- The malware score should be at the top end, close to 1, given the clear exfiltration of sensitive data.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as there's no evidence of code obfuscation.\n- The risk score should be very high, close to 1, due to the security implications.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **1.0** — The code explicitly leaks private keys, which is malicious.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** **1.0** — The security risk is critical, exposing private keys over external channels.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports correctly identify the malicious behavior. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.",
