{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'solana_utils', specifying dependencies, metadata, and packaging details.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependency lists, and configuration parameters; primarily from the setup() function call and its arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process user input or external data at runtime.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining package details to installing dependencies, with no runtime data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The code is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools and invokes setup() with static metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, no external data processing, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs are present. It appears to be a standard package configuration script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
