{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'solana_utils', including its dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata and dependencies from the script; no external or untrusted data input is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions are present.",
  "flows": "Since the code is straightforward package setup, there are no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code patterns, or hardcoded secrets. The setup script is standard and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard 'setuptools' functions to define package metadata and dependencies. It specifies dependencies with version constraints and Python compatibility. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data handling occurs. The code appears to be a normal setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply specifies package details and dependencies.",
