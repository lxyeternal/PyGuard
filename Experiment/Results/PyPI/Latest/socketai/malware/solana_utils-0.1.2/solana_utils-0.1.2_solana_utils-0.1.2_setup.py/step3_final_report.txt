  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the solana_utils Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, version info, dependencies in install_requires, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Static configuration data used during package installation; no dynamic data flow or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, specifies static metadata, dependencies with version constraints, classifiers, and Python version requirements. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or obfuscated logic is present. The dependencies are common packages, and the code serves purely as configuration. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's static, straightforward nature. Given the absence of suspicious patterns or malicious intent, the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
