{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging of the Python project 'solana_utils' including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'install_requires' list, the 'find_packages()' function, and the setup parameters such as 'name', 'version', 'classifiers', and 'python_requires'.",
  "sinks": "The setup process writes to the filesystem when packaging the module. The 'install_requires' list specifies dependencies that may be fetched during installation.",
  "flows": "The package configuration data flows from the setup script to the packaging and installation process, and dependencies are fetched from external repositories during install.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Usage of common packaging functions and standard dependencies without obfuscated code or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers in a conventional manner. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are observed. Dependencies are typical for such a project, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious injection. The code is straightforward and intended for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to common packaging practices without anomalies.",
