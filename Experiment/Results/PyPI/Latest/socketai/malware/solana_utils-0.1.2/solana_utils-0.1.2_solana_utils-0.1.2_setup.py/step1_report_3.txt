  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior; standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It specifies package requirements and metadata, with no dynamic code, external input handling, or suspicious patterns. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The dependencies listed are common and do not indicate malicious intent by themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward package setup configuration without any malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures.",
