{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for the Python package 'solana_utils' including its dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'setuptools' module and the 'install_requires' list within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "The setup configuration itself does not contain sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No untrusted data handling or external data transmission is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely configuration for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or sensitive information handling is observed. The dependencies specified are standard Python packages. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The code's structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
