{
  "purpose": "The code executes a custom install class that, after performing standard installation, imports and runs 'main()' from 'main', during every package installation.",
  "sources": "The 'run()' method in 'CrazyInstallStrat' imports 'main' from 'main' module.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during setup, which could run arbitrary code or malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "During installation, 'install.run(self)' executes, then 'main()' is imported and called, executing any code within 'main'.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual pattern of executing external code ('main()') during package setup; no validation or restrictions shown.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that, after standard installation, imports and executes 'main()' from 'main'. This pattern is atypical and potentially dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and does not contain hardcoded secrets or network activity. The risk depends entirely on the content of 'main.py'. If 'main()' contains malicious code, this pattern could be exploited for supply chain attacks. The scores assigned in the reports range from low to high, with higher scores justified if 'main()' is malicious. Given the pattern, a conservative malware score of 0.6 and a security risk score of 0.7 are appropriate, reflecting the inherent danger of executing external code during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant supply chain security risk. Without inspecting 'main.py', the exact maliciousness cannot be confirmed, but the behavior itself warrants caution and further review.",
