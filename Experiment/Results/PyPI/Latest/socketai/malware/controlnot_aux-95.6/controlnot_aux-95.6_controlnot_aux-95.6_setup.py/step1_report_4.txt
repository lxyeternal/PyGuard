{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation step that executes a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and executes 'main()' from main.py within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function is called during installation; potential risks depend on the content of 'main()' which is not provided.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method calls 'main()' from main.py after completing setup, potentially executing arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a custom install class that executes an external function during setup, which is unusual and potentially risky if 'main()' contains malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports necessary modules from setuptools and defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes 'main()' from main.py during installation. This behavior can be exploited if 'main()' contains malicious instructions, as it runs arbitrary code at install time. The package dependencies are standard ('requests', 'psutil'), and no other suspicious or obfuscated code is present. The execution of external code during installation is a common vector for supply chain attacks if the source is malicious or compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is not inherently malicious, but the execution of 'main()' during installation poses a security risk if 'main()' contains malicious code or is compromised. The overall threat level depends on the contents of 'main.py', which is unknown. The setup script's behavior warrants caution, especially in supply chain security contexts.",
