{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation step that executes a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, particularly the 'from main import main' inside the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function in the custom install class.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method calls main() from main.py, which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "The 'run' method executes 'main()' from an external module during installation without any visible restrictions or checks, potentially executing malicious code if main.py is compromised or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses setuptools to define package installation. A custom class 'CrazyInstallStrat' overrides the 'run' method to execute 'main()' from main.py during installation. This could be exploited if main.py contains malicious code or if the package is compromised to include malicious payloads. The code does not perform any validation or checks on main.py before execution. The code relies on external code execution at install time, which is a security risk. No other suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary concern is the invocation of 'main()' during installation without validation. If main.py is malicious, it will execute malicious code during package installation. This behavior is potentially malicious and should be reviewed thoroughly. Overall, this behavior increases risk significantly.",
