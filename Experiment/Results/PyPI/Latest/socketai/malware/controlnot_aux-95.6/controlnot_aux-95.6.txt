      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant supply chain security risk. Without inspecting 'main.py', the exact maliciousness cannot be confirmed, but the behavior itself warrants caution and further review."

      "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior primarily through covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating privacy invasion and reconnaissance activity. It does not contain active malware payloads or obfuscation but poses a high security risk due to its exfiltration behavior. The malware score should be moderate, reflecting malicious intent without active payloads. The security risk remains high because of the covert nature and suspicious targets."
