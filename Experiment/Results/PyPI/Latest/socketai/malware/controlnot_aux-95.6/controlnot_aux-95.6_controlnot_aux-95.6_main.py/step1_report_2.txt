  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses; encode MAC addresses; send collected data to remote servers via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which executes system commands to retrieve MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() which makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs with embedded parameters.",
  "flows": "System info sources -> encoding MAC addresses -> constructing URL with parameters -> sending data via HTTP GET to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to execute system commands for MAC address retrieval, which may vary across OS. The URLs contacted are suspicious and hosted on domains that could be malicious. No explicit validation or sanitization of data. Data including hostname, username, current directory, and encoded MAC addresses are sent without user consent or notification.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are obtained via OS-specific system calls, which could be used for device fingerprinting or tracking. The data is base64-encoded and then sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple remote URLs that appear suspicious and possibly malicious. The URLs do not resemble legitimate endpoints and may be used for data exfiltration or command-and-control purposes. The code does not include any user consent prompts, encryption of data in transit is not specified beyond standard HTTPS requests, and no error handling or logging reveals the nature of these requests. The code’s structure and data flow suggest an intent to silently gather and transmit system identifiers, which is characteristic of malicious or privacy-invasive behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be designed to covertly collect system information and transmit it to suspicious external servers, which indicates malicious intent. The use of system commands to retrieve MAC addresses, combined with sending data to potentially malicious domains, raises significant security concerns. The code does not contain obfuscation or complex malware techniques but performs behaviors consistent with information theft or device fingerprinting without user awareness.",
