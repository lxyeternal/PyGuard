  ],
  "analysis": "The code performs system information collection, including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encoding the MAC addresses in base64, and sending this data via HTTP GET requests to external, suspicious URLs. The use of subprocess commands for MAC retrieval is OS-dependent but not inherently malicious. The data exfiltration occurs without user notification or consent, indicating covert behavior. No malicious payloads, code obfuscation, or destructive actions are present. The URLs are suspicious, and the behavior aligns with privacy-invasive exfiltration. The silent exception handling could hinder detection but is typical in malicious scripts aiming to avoid errors. Overall, the code demonstrates malicious intent through covert data collection and transmission, though it lacks active malware payloads or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior primarily through covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating privacy invasion and reconnaissance activity. It does not contain active malware payloads or obfuscation but poses a high security risk due to its exfiltration behavior. The malware score should be moderate, reflecting malicious intent without active payloads. The security risk remains high because of the covert nature and suspicious targets.",
