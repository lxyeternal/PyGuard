{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to specified remote URLs encoded in base64, possibly for tracking or surveillance.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (hostname, username, current directory), system information (MAC addresses), and potentially untrusted network endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP GET requests to remote URLs using urllib.request.urlopen(), which transmits the collected data over the network.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info and environment data) are encoded and included as URL parameters, then transmitted over HTTP GET requests to multiple remote domains.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs used are suspicious, pointing to non-standard domains with subdomains like 'oast-cn', 'oast-row', 'oast.fun', which resemble test or malicious C2 servers. The code encodes MAC addresses in base64 and sends them without user consent or explicit purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses from the system, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and constructs URLs with these parameters. It then attempts to contact multiple external servers, likely for data exfiltration or tracking. The URLs appear suspicious, and the collection of system identifiers without clear user consent suggests malicious intent. The code does not perform any harmful actions like modifying files or executing malicious commands, but it does gather and transmit potentially sensitive system info covertly. The use of random numbers in URLs and encoded MAC addresses are typical in data collection or malware C2 communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be used for covertly collecting and transmitting system information to external servers, which is indicative of malicious behavior, possibly for tracking or control. The suspicious domain names and data collection without user awareness increase the risk. It does not execute harmful payloads directly but facilitates data exfiltration.",
