  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to external URLs encoded in Base64 and URL parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads system info: platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), and MAC addresses via subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP requests to external URLs with collected data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Collects MAC addresses and system info -> encodes MAC addresses in Base64 -> constructs URLs with parameters -> sends HTTP requests to these URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Uses external URLs with suspicious domains, encodes MAC addresses in Base64 possibly to obfuscate data, and transmits system info without user consent or obvious purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code collects host-related information and MAC addresses, encodes MAC addresses in Base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to three external URLs. The URLs are non-standard, suspicious, and potentially malicious. The data flow is straightforward, and there is no user interaction or local data storage. The code does not include any hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors but does transmit system details to untrusted domains, which could be used for tracking or malicious reconnaissance. No malicious system modification or destructive actions are evident, but the data exfiltration pattern is suspicious, especially given the suspicious domains and obfuscated MAC addresses.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system data collection and exfiltration to suspicious external domains, which indicates potentially malicious behavior aimed at tracking or reconnaissance. No direct malware actions like system damage are present, but the data exfiltration pattern is concerning.",
