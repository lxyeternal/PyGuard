  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current directory, then send this data to multiple remote URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network interfaces and executing subprocess commands",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending HTTP GET requests with system data as URL parameters",
  "flows": "System info sources -> data encoding (base64) and URL parameter construction -> HTTP GET requests to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to retrieve network interface info, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and sending data to suspicious, non-verified URLs. The URLs are on domains associated with potential malicious activity or obfuscation. No user input is directly taken, but system info is exfiltrated.",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses through system commands. It encodes MAC addresses in base64 before transmitting. The URLs used are suspicious, potentially malicious domains often associated with data exfiltration or command-and-control servers. The code performs network requests without validation, exception handling is silent, and data is sent via URL parameters, which could leak sensitive system info. The retrieval of MAC addresses via subprocess commands and sending to untrusted domains indicates an intent to exfiltrate system data. No malicious code execution, backdoors, or direct malware activities are evident, but the data exfiltration and suspicious domains pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is collecting and transmitting system information to potentially malicious external domains, which indicates malicious intent related to data exfiltration. It does not contain obfuscated code or evident malware payloads but poses security risks through unauthorized data transmission.",
