  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (reading system info and MAC addresses), random.randint() for generating rd_num, and encoded MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending GET requests with encoded parameters to external domains.",
  "flows": "System info and MAC addresses are collected and encoded, then included as URL parameters in requests to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious URLs (likely malicious or testing domains), encoding MAC addresses in base64 (possible privacy concern), no explicit user consent or obvious benign purpose. The URLs suggest data exfiltration or command and control communication.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers host system information, including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses via platform-specific commands. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, which can obscure data, possibly to avoid detection. The code then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to potentially malicious domains. The URLs are suspicious, appearing as known malicious or phishing-related domains. The use of try-except around network calls suppresses errors but does not indicate malicious intent directly. The code could be used for data exfiltration or reconnaissance without user consent. No malicious code such as backdoors, data theft beyond system info, or hidden activities is explicitly present, but the behavior aligns with covert data collection and transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system and MAC information and transmits it to suspicious external servers, indicating potential privacy invasion or reconnaissance activity. While no direct malicious payloads or backdoors are present, the behavior of data exfiltration to untrusted domains is suspicious and warrants caution.",
