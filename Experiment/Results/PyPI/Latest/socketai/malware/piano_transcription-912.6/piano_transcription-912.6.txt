The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, reflecting high suspicion and danger. This package should be reviewed thoroughly before use, and such behaviors should be avoided or sandboxed to prevent security breaches."

The scores in the reports are appropriate, though the malware score could be slightly increased to reflect the high malicious potential. It should be flagged for review and possibly removed from any package distributions."
