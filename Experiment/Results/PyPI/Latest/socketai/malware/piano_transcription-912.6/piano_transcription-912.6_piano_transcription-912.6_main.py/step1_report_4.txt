  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current directory, random number) -> URL with encoded parameters -> HTTP request to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Data is sent to suspicious, non-standard domains; no user consent or obvious purpose; use of multiple external URLs for data exfiltration; dynamic URL construction with system info; no delay or encryption; simple HTTP GET request",
  "analysis": "The code collects system information including hostname, username, current directory, and generates a random number. It constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains, appending collected data as URL parameters. It then performs HTTP GET requests to these URLs, potentially exfiltrating data. The URLs are suspicious and hosted on domains that do not appear legitimate. No input validation or user notification is present. This pattern is consistent with data exfiltration or command and control communication. No other malicious activities such as code execution or system damage are observed. The code appears to be designed for tracking or malicious data harvesting without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system info and transmitting it to suspicious external domains. It likely functions as a data exfiltration or tracking script embedded in a package, which poses a security risk. The overall intent appears malicious, with no legitimate purpose evident.",
