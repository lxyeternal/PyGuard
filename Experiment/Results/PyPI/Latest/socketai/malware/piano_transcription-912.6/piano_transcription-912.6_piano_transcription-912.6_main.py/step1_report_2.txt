  "purpose": "The script collects system information and sends it to predefined external URLs, possibly for tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() for each constructed URL",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory) and a random number are included as parameters in GET requests sent to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external domains, gathering system info, and sending it via GET requests without user consent. The URLs and data collection patterns are unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and network modules to gather hostname, username, current directory, and generates a random number. It then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains, appending collected data as query parameters. The code performs HTTP GET requests to these URLs, logging responses or errors. The presence of multiple known suspicious domains and the automated data transmission pattern indicates possible malicious intent. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are present; the behavior appears straightforward but potentially malicious for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code likely performs data collection and transmission to malicious or suspicious domains, possibly for tracking or reconnaissance purposes. It does not contain obfuscation or obvious backdoors but exhibits behavior consistent with malicious data exfiltration.",
