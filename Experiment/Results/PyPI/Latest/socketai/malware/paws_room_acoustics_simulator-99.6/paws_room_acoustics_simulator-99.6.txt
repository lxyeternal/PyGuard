      "conclusion": "The setup script executes external code during installation, which is a significant security concern and potentially malicious. The pattern is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes. The high scores in the reports are justified; the overall risk is high. This package should be scrutinized or avoided unless 'main.py' is verified safe."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior, employing obfuscation and silent failure handling to mask its activity. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious or at least highly privacy-invasive, warranting further review or removal."
