{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with a custom installation step that executes code from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method of CrazyInstallStrat calls 'from main import m' and executes m().",
  "sinks": "Execution of the function m() imported from main.py, which could perform any actions depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method executes 'from main import m' and then calls 'm()'.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes arbitrary code (m()) after installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious if 'm()' contains harmful code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, after running the standard install process, imports a function 'm' from 'main' and executes it. This post-installation code execution is uncommon and can be used to run arbitrary or malicious code without user consent. The code does not specify what 'm()' does; its behavior depends on 'main.py', which is external to this script. The rest of the setup code appears standard, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The script executes arbitrary code during installation by calling 'm()' from 'main.py', which is a significant security concern. This behavior could be exploited to run malicious code or compromise the system after installation. The rest of the code is standard package setup code, but the post-install execution makes this package potentially dangerous.",
