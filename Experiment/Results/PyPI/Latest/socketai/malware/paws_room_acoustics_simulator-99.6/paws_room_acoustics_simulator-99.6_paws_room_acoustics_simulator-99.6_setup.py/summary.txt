  "conclusion": "The setup script executes external code during installation, which is a significant security concern and potentially malicious. The pattern is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes. The high scores in the reports are justified; the overall risk is high. This package should be scrutinized or avoided unless 'main.py' is verified safe."
