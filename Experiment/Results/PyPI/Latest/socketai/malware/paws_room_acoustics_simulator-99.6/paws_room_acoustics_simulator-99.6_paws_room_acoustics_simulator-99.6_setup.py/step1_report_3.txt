  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'paws_room_acoustics_simulator' package, with a custom installation step that executes code after installation.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method of the CrazyInstallStrat class, which imports and executes the 'm' function from the 'main' module.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'm()' from 'main' after installation, which could potentially run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method executes 'from main import m' and then calls 'm()'.",
  "anomalies": "The custom installer runs code ('m()') immediately after installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious if 'main.m' contains malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, after performing the standard installation, imports and executes the 'm' function from the 'main' module. This behavior executes code upon installation, which could be exploited to run malicious payloads or perform unauthorized actions. No other suspicious or obfuscated code elements are present. The presence of the 'install' class executing external code is uncommon and warrants scrutiny.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes arbitrary code ('m()') from the 'main' module during installation, which could be malicious. This pattern is suspicious, as it allows code to run automatically post-install, potentially leading to malicious activity or unintended side effects.",
