  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory, and send this data to multiple remote servers via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "Reading system info (`platform.system()`, `pltfrm.node()`, `gtps.getuser()`, `osys.getcwd()`), reading MAC addresses via `subprocess.check_output()`",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to remote URLs constructed with system info parameters, potential data exfiltration",
  "flows": "System info sources → data encoding and URL construction → HTTP GET requests to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded URLs, encoding MAC addresses and transmitting to multiple external domains, no validation or sanitization, no user consent, exception handling that suppresses errors",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system details such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses depending on the OS. MAC addresses are encoded in base64 and sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains. The URLs are embedded in base64 and decoded at runtime, possibly to obfuscate the destinations. There is no user notification or consent mechanism. The code suppresses exceptions silently, which might hide failures. The collected data can be used for tracking or unauthorized reconnaissance. The use of multiple remote endpoints and encoded URLs suggests an attempt to avoid detection, indicating suspicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects sensitive system information and transmits it to external servers without user knowledge or consent, exhibiting behaviors typical of data exfiltration or tracking malware. Although no malicious payload like code execution or destructive actions is present, the pattern of data collection and obfuscated URLs is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
