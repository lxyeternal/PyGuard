  "purpose": "Collect system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory, and send this data to remote servers via encoded URLs.",
  "sources": "Reading system info (platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), generating random numbers (rndm.randint), decoding base64 strings.",
  "sinks": "Sending HTTP requests to remote URLs constructed with collected data, potentially leaking system info.",
  "flows": "Collect system info -> encode data -> construct URLs -> send HTTP requests with system info as parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for URLs, dynamic URL construction, no explicit validation or user interaction, collection and transmission of potentially sensitive data without user consent, multiple URL endpoints for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system hostname, username, MAC addresses, current working directory, and generates a random number. It encodes the MAC address list in base64. It decodes three hardcoded base64 URLs pointing to external domains. The script then constructs URLs with collected data as query parameters and sends HTTP requests to these URLs. There is no response handling beyond passing exceptions, which suggests it attempts to silently exfiltrate data. The collection of system identifiers and network communication without user awareness indicates malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or tracking. The use of base64 encoding for URLs could be to evade simple detection mechanisms. No direct malicious commands like system modification or destructive actions are present, but the data collection and transmission are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly collecting sensitive system information and sending it to remote servers, indicating a potential information-stealing or tracking malware. The obfuscation via base64 URL decoding and silent request handling supports malicious intent. The overall security risk is high.",
