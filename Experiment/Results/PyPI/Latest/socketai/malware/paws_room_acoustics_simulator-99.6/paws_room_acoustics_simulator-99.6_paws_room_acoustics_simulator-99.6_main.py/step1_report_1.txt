{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then encode and send this data to remote servers via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Reads system info from platform, getpass, os, and subprocess modules; gathers network interface MAC addresses; retrieves hostname and username; gets current working directory.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP requests with system data embedded in URL parameters to three different remote servers, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Collects system info (source), encodes and constructs URLs with this data, then makes HTTP requests to external servers (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 encoding to obfuscate server URLs; collects MAC addresses, hostname, username, and directory without clear user consent; sends data to multiple servers, possibly for tracking; exceptions are silently ignored, which could hide failures or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system-specific information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. MAC addresses are obtained through platform-specific commands, then encoded with base64. The code constructs URLs from hardcoded base64-encoded strings, decoding them at runtime. It appends system info as URL parameters and sends HTTP requests to remote servers. The URL targets seem to be suspicious or possibly malicious due to obfuscation. The silent exception handling prevents detection of failed transmissions. Overall, the script appears to exfiltrate user and system data to external servers without user consent, indicating potentially malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects sensitive system data and transmits it to remote servers covertly, suggesting malicious behavior and potential privacy violations. Its obfuscation and silent failure handling further support suspicion of malicious intent.",
