  "purpose": "Collect system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data to remote servers via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "Reads system info (platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), retrieves MAC addresses, and encodes MAC info with base64.",
  "sinks": "URLs constructed with user and system data sent via urllib.request.urlopen, which could transmit data to external servers.",
  "flows": "System info and MAC addresses are gathered and encoded, then included as URL parameters sent to multiple remote servers. Data flows from input functions to URL construction and then to external network requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for URLs and MAC addresses; no explicit hardcoded credentials but multiple external URLs are hardcoded and obfuscated. No clear indication of data collection intent beyond system info. Exception handling suppresses errors silently. No evidence of code obfuscation, but the URLs are base64-encoded, possibly to obscure their purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers environment details, encodes MAC addresses and URL endpoints, and sends the data via HTTP GET requests to three remote servers. The URLs are base64-encoded, which might serve as obfuscation. It does not perform malicious actions like data theft, system damage, or unauthorized control. However, it discreetly transmits system identifiers and network info to external servers without user consent, which could be considered privacy-invading or suspicious depending on context. The use of URL obfuscation and silent exception handling might suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity, though the code itself does not perform harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily collects system and network info and transmits it to external servers. While it does not exhibit explicit malicious behavior like malware or system damage, its covert data transmission and URL obfuscation raise privacy and security concerns. It appears designed for data exfiltration rather than malicious sabotage, but the intent depends on user context.",
