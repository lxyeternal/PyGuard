{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'eosio_signerz' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version, description, author info, classifiers, dependencies).",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks for untrusted data or user input in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from package metadata definitions into the setup() function, which processes and uses this data to build the package.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials (apart from author email which is not suspicious), or other anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It contains no dynamic code execution, no reading of external untrusted input, and no suspicious behaviors. The dependencies list is commented out, indicating no external dependencies are specified. The author email is hardcoded but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, it appears to be a typical, benign packaging script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious behavior or security risks. It lacks suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
