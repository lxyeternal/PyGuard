  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious code behavior. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No input reading, no untrusted data processing, and no dynamic code execution are present. The install_requires list is commented out, indicating no dependency-related issues or hidden code. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this setup script. It appears to be a standard package configuration file with no suspicious activity.",
