  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'eosio_signerz' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata (name, version, description, author, dependencies) from the setup() function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static metadata definitions into the setup() configuration, with no dynamic or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The email address is publicly visible but not suspicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to configure packaging. It does not perform any runtime operations, input handling, or external calls. All parameters are statically defined. No code injection, malicious behaviors, or security risks are evident. The email address and package details are publicly accessible and appear benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical, benign setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
