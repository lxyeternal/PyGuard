{
  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata for a Python project using setuptools, intended for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() call, including package name, version, author info, classifiers, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration with no data flow or dynamic processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and conventional for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools to specify package metadata. It contains only static information with no dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The author email is publicly visible but not suspicious. No dependencies are actively included. The structure and content are typical for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the static and transparent nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are justified. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
