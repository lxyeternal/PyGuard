  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, static setup script using setuptools.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, or external data sources are involved.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets (beyond author email, which is not suspicious).\n- Dependencies are commented out, indicating no hidden or malicious dependencies.\n- No network activity, code injection, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n**Specific points per report:**\n- **Reports 1-5:** Consistently describe the code as benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence levels:** All are at 1, indicating high certainty in their benign assessment.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, aligning with the conclusion that there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, confirming the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk scores:** All are 0, consistent with the above.\n\n**Potential issues or errors:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no logical flaws or misjudgments are apparent.\n- The only minor point is the author email being publicly visible, but this is typical and not suspicious.\n\n**Score justifications:**\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; code is clear and standard.\n- The overall security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I concur with the assessments. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear, straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' consensus and the nature of the code.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and comprehensive; no changes are necessary.",
