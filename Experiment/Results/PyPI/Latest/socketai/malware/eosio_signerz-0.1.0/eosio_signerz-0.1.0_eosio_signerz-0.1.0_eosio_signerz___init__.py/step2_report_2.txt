  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Summary:** The report correctly states that this is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n   - **Scores:** confidence 0.9, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.\n   - **Assessment:** These scores seem appropriate given the minimal code and benign nature. The high confidence aligns with the straightforward import statement. No changes needed.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes the import as standard and benign.\n   - **Scores:** confidence 0.9, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.\n   - **Assessment:** Correct. The scores are reasonable; no adjustments necessary.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Summary:** Slightly lower confidence (0.7) and a small security risk score (0.1) are assigned, possibly reflecting some cautiousness.\n   - **Scores:** confidence 0.7, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1.\n   - **Assessment:** Given only an import statement, the security risk score of 0.1 may be slightly high unless there’s context suggesting the 'key' module is suspicious. Since the report explicitly states no suspicious behavior and only a standard import, I recommend lowering the securityRisk to 0 or 0.05 for consistency.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Summary:** Fully benign, standard import, high confidence (1).\n   - **Scores:** confidence 1, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.\n   - **Assessment:** Appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Summary:** Again, a straightforward import, high confidence, no malicious activity.\n   - **Scores:** confidence 1, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.\n   - **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, aligning with the simplicity of the code.\n- The securityRisk scores are mostly 0, except for Report 3, which assigns 0.1. Since there's no evidence of security issues from this import alone, I suggest lowering this to 0 for consistency.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 across all reports, as the import alone doesn't introduce security risks.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and standard.",
