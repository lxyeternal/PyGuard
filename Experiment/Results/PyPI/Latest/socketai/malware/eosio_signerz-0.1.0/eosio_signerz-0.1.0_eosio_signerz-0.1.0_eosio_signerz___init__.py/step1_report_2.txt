  "purpose": "Importing the EOSIOKey class from a local module named 'key'.",
  "sources": "The import statement accesses the local module 'key' and the class 'EOSIOKey' within it.",
  "sinks": "None in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow detected; import statement only references local module.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of context makes it difficult to detect anomalies; the import alone is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import of a class from a relative module. No malicious code, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is evident. Without further context or code, there are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase.",
