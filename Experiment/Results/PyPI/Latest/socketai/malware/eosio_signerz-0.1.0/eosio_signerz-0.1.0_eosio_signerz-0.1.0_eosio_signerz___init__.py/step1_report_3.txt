{
  "purpose": "Import the EOSIOKey class from the local key module, likely for cryptographic or key management purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'key' to import EOSIOKey.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this single line; no untrusted data handling or output occurs here.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this is only an import statement, not data flow code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a standard import of a class from a relative module. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. As this is only an import statement, it doesn't provide enough context to determine the behavior of 'EOSIOKey'.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this single import statement, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign.",
