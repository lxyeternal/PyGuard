  "purpose": "Import statement for the EOSIOKey class from a local key module, likely used for cryptographic or key management purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading the import statement from the current module and the local key module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only imports a class definition.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data movement; purely a static import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard Python import statement referencing a local module. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The import itself does not perform any operations or data handling. Given the minimal context, the code appears benign. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and very low security risk scores. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No further action is necessary based solely on this snippet.",
