  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**  \n   - **Issue presence:** No, the code is just an import statement.  \n   - **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.  \n   - **Scores:** Confidence is high (0.9), and all risk scores are zero, which is appropriate.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies benign nature.  \n\n2. **Report 2**  \n   - **Issue presence:** No, the import is standard.  \n   - **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is consistent.  \n   - **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, all zeros, which aligns with the benign assessment.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Appropriate.  \n\n3. **Report 3**  \n   - **Issue presence:** No, just an import.  \n   - **Errors/flaws:** The securityRisk score is 0.1, which is very low; perhaps a minimal concern but not indicative of malicious intent.  \n   - **Scores:** Confidence 0.7, which is reasonable given the lack of context.  \n   - **Justification for risk:** Since it's only an import, the risk score should remain low, which it does.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Correctly assesses benign intent.  \n\n4. **Report 4**  \n   - **Issue presence:** No.  \n   - **Errors/flaws:** No.  \n   - **Scores:** All zeros, confidence 1, consistent with benign assessment.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Valid.  \n\n5. **Report 5**  \n   - **Issue presence:** No.  \n   - **Errors/flaws:** No.  \n   - **Scores:** Confidence 1, all zeros, consistent with benign.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.  \n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code snippet is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward, no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk evident from this snippet)  \n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile these import statements are benign, it's important to review the actual implementation of `EOSIOKey` in the `key` module to ensure it doesn't contain malicious code or vulnerabilities. However, based solely on this snippet, the assessment is correct.",
