  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward import statement: `from .key import EOSIOKey`.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior in the code snippet itself.\n   - The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the simplicity of the import statement.\n   - They correctly note the lack of anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws are evident; the assessments align with the minimal code.\n\n3. **Scores Review:**\n   - **Malware scores:** All are zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Security risk scores:** Mostly zero, with one report giving 0.1, which is acceptable as a conservative estimate considering the lack of context.\n   - **Confidence levels:** Range from 0.7 to 1, reflecting high confidence in benignity.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is only an import statement with no malicious activity, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The one report with 0.1 security risk is reasonable as a conservative placeholder, but it does not imply actual risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0, indicating no malicious behavior.\n   - The import of a class from a local module is standard practice and not malicious.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all acknowledge the lack of context and benign nature.\n   - They correctly refrain from inferring malicious intent solely from the import statement.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The high confidence levels support the conclusion that the code is benign.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk indicated)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code snippet is a simple, standard import statement with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. Unless additional context or code reveals otherwise, this import is benign.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nNo further action needed based on this snippet. Continue monitoring larger code context for any suspicious patterns.",
