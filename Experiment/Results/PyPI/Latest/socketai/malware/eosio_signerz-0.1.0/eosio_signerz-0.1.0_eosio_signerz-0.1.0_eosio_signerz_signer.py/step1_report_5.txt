  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class 'Signer' for cryptographic signing operations",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'private_str' in __init__ method",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present",
  "flows": "No data flow to sensitive sinks; methods are abstract and lack implementations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be a straightforward abstract class definition",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with abstract methods for signing and verifying data. It initializes with an optional private key string but does not process or store it in any suspicious way. No external data sources, network calls, or code execution features are present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are detected. The code is a standard pattern for cryptographic abstractions, with no malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple abstract class setup for cryptographic signing, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It contains no operational code, no data leaks, and no signs of sabotage or malware.",
