{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class 'Signer' for cryptographic signing operations",
  "sources": "None explicitly; potential input sources could be any data passed to the 'sign' and 'verify' methods, but not present in this snippet",
  "sinks": "Methods that would output or process cryptographic signatures and keys, but no concrete output or data sinks are present in the code",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines an interface without actual data flow or execution logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the class is a standard abstract base class with method definitions, no data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'Signer' with a constructor and four abstract methods related to cryptographic operations. It does not contain executable code, data handling, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. As a purely interface definition, it poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, harmless abstract class interface for cryptographic signing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
