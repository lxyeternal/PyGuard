{
  "purpose": "The function creates two dictionaries mapping (book, chapter, verse) tuples to verse text, for texts with and without spaces.",
  "sources": "The input parameters ZippedTupleNoSpaces and ZippedTupleWithSpaces, which are zipped iterables containing book numbers and text data structures.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems or use untrusted inputs in a vulnerable way. No sinks related to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (sources) through nested loops, constructing dictionary keys and values, then returning the dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or unusual code patterns are observed. Commented-out debug prints are benign, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code processes two input tuples containing book data. It iterates over chapters and verses to build dictionaries keyed by (book, chapter, verse). The structure and logic are straightforward, with no apparent malicious activity. The code lacks network calls, file operations, or any other potentially harmful behavior. The commented-out print statements are benign debugging code. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The function is a standard data processing routine to organize biblical text data into dictionaries for easy lookup. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code fragment.",
