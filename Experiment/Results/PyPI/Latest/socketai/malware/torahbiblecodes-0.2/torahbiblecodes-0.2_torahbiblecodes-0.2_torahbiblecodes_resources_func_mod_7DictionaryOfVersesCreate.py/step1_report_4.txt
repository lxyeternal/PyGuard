{
  "purpose": "The function creates two dictionaries mapping tuples of (book, chapter, verse) to verse text, for two sets of biblical texts with and without spaces.",
  "sources": "Input parameters ZippedTupleNoSpaces and ZippedTupleWithSpaces, which are lists of tuples containing integers and dictionaries with textual data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink identified; data is stored in dictionaries for further use.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input tuples into dictionaries keyed by (book, chapter, verse).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward, with commented-out print statements for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The function iterates over input data structures, extracting book numbers, chapters, and verses, and storing verses in dictionaries with tuple keys. No external data reads, network activity, or data leakage occurs. No unsafe eval, exec, or suspicious string manipulations are present. The commented-out print statements suggest debugging intentions but do not impact security. The code appears solely designed for data organization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data processing routine with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply structures input text data into dictionaries for downstream use. No anomalies or malware features are detected.",
