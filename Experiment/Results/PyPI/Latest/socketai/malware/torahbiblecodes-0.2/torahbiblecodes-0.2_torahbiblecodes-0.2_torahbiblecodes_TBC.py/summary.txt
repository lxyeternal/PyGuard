  "conclusion": "The code is a standard modular CLI framework that relies on external modules loaded dynamically. It does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation. The main security risk stems from trusting external modules, which could execute malicious code if compromised. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3 to 0.45). Proper validation or sandboxing of modules is recommended to mitigate this risk."
