{
  "purpose": "This code configures the setup for a Python package named 'torahbiblecodes' using setuptools, including reading a README file and setting metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, static package and metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or user inputs are present; the setup process is static and does not process external untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is reading the README.md content into the long_description variable, which is then used in the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local README.md file for package description, then calls setuptools.setup with static metadata and package configuration. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. All data used are static strings or file contents. The code follows standard Python package setup conventions and does not include any suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It simply prepares a Python package for distribution.",
