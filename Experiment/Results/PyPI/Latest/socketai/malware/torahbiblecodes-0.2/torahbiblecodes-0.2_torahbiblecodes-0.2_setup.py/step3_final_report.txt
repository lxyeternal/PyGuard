{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata, entry points, and including package data.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata; entry point 'tbc-cli=torahbiblecodes.TBC:main'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable handling beyond static reads.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setting package info -> defining CLI entry point; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious logic. It reads a README file, sets package metadata, and defines CLI entry points. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The package data inclusion pattern is broad but common. The comments are benign. Overall, the code is clean, well-structured, and typical for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. All signals indicate a safe configuration, and the scores should reflect this.",
