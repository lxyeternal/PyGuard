  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'torahbiblecodes', configuring package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; package metadata definitions; no untrusted input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Package data inclusion; no untrusted data sinks or external network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; standard package setup flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README.md file for description and defines package metadata, including an entry point for CLI usage. No external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no hardcoded credentials. The structure is typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign and standard package setup file with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
