  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> Setting package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward setup script with no embedded malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. It reads a README.md file for the long description and configures package metadata such as name, version, author, URL, and package data. The commented lines suggest possible alternative configurations but do not execute. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious dependencies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a benign, standard Python package setup script without any malicious intent or security issues.",
