  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'torahbiblecodes' Python package, including metadata and package data inclusion.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; package metadata and data inclusion from hardcoded strings and package structure.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no user input or external data sources processed in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; primarily static setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the setup script appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical Python package setup using setuptools, reading a README file and configuring package metadata, data files, and entry points. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All code functions as expected for a setup script with no hidden or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
