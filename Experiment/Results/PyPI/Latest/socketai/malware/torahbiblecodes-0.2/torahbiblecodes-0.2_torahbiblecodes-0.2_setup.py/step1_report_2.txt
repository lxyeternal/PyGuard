  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'torahbiblecodes' Python package, including metadata and entry points for command-line execution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; static package configuration data within 'setuptools.setup()'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data flows detected.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration without input/output data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines package metadata and setup configuration for distribution. It reads a README file to include as a long description, specifies package data, and sets up command-line entry points. No external input handling, network operations, or code execution features are present. All code appears standard for a setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard package setup tasks without any suspicious activity.",
