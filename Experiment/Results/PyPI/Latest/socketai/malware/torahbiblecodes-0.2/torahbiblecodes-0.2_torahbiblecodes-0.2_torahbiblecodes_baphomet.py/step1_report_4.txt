  "raw_response": "{\n  \"purpose\": \"The script implements a Telegram bot that processes Hebrew and other texts, translating and searching through biblical texts, potentially for religious or cryptographic analysis.\",\n  \"sources\": \"Reads input from Telegram messages, callback data, and user input; loads configurations, translation data, and book data from external resources and files.\",\n  \"sinks\": \"Sends messages back to users; calls translation functions; handles threading and job queues; saves user data and logs to files.\",\n  \"flows\": \"User input → message parsing → command detection → search/translation functions → message responses; input data may flow into translation and search functions, with results sent back to users.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"The code contains commented-out code and placeholders with no clear purpose, such as 'if \"\"==\"\"', which is always true, and unused imports. It also loads numerous resources and modules without evident validation or sanitization. No hardcoded credentials are visible, but the code handles user data and logs that could be sensitive.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code functions primarily as a Telegram bot with multi-threaded translation and search capabilities related to biblical texts. The translation and search functions rely on external resources ('resources.func.torah', 'modules.resources.books', etc.), which are not shown, making detailed security analysis of internal logic limited. The use of threading and queues appears standard. No evident code injection, remote code execution, or network data exfiltration is apparent within this code segment. The bot processes user commands and logs data locally, which could pose privacy concerns but not necessarily malicious intent. There is no suspicious network activity, malicious code injection, or backdoors. The code does not perform any unsafe SQL operations, dynamic code execution, or credential theft. The presence of commented-out code and seemingly placeholder conditions suggest it might be incomplete or experimental but not malicious. Overall, the code lacks indicators of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The analyzed code appears to be a Telegram bot designed for biblical text processing, translation, and search functionalities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware within this module. It primarily handles user commands, processes data, and logs activity locally. The overall security risk is low, assuming external modules and resources are trustworthy. No immediate security threats or malicious intent are detected.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
