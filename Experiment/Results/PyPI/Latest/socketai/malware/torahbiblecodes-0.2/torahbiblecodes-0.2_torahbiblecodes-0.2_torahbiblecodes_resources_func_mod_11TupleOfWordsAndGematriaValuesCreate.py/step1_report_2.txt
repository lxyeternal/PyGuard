  "purpose": "Create a tuple pairing each word in a list with its corresponding Gematria value.",
  "sources": "Function input parameters: ListOfWords and NW.",
  "sinks": "The tuple returned by the function, which combines input data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> tuple(zip) -> return tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that takes two inputs: a list of words and a list of Gematria values. It zips these inputs into a tuple of pairs and returns the result. There are no external data reads, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious operations. The code is straightforward and only processes data passed as parameters without any side effects or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purposefully creates a pairing of words and numeric values, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
