  "purpose": "Create a tuple pairing each word with its corresponding Gematria value from the provided lists.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'ListOfWords' and 'NW' lists.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the tuple; no external sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input lists are zipped into a tuple of pairs and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; commented-out print statements are benign debugging artifacts.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward function that zips two lists into a tuple of pairs, with no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. It performs a simple data pairing operation, which is safe. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The function's purpose is clear, and the code is minimal and correct. The commented print statements do not introduce any risk. Overall, the code is benign and serves as a utility for pairing words with Gematria values.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs a simple data pairing operation without any obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
