{
  "purpose": "Create and return a tuple pairing each word in a list with its corresponding Gematria value from a provided list.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'ListOfWords' and 'NW' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input data flows directly into the zip() function to create a tuple pairing words with values, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of commented-out print statements; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that zips two lists into a tuple. It does not perform any I/O operations, network activity, or malicious behavior. The commented-out print statements suggest debugging but do not influence functionality. No external or untrusted data is processed in a harmful way, and the code performs a basic pairing operation. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payload, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and intended to pair words with their Gematria values. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected.",
