  "purpose": "Create a tuple pairing each word in a list with corresponding gematria values.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'ListOfWords' and 'NW' provided to the function.",
  "fires": "Tuple construction using zip applied directly to input lists; no other data flow present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to tuple creation via zip.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that takes two lists and creates a tuple of pairs using zip. It includes commented-out print statements for debugging. No external data reading, no untrusted data handling beyond the inputs provided, and no malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network access, or code injection are present. The code's structure is simple and clear, serving a basic data pairing purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving a straightforward purpose of pairing words with gematria values. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
