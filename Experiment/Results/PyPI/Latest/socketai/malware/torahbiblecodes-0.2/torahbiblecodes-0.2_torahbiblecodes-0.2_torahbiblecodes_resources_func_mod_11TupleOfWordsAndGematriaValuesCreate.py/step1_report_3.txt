{
  "purpose": "Create and return a tuple pairing each word in a list with its corresponding Gematria value from a provided list.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: ListOfWords and NW (both passed to the function).",
  "sinks": "The function primarily processes data in memory; no external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameters into the tuple creation, which is then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code structures are present. Commented-out debug prints are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward function that zips two lists into a tuple. There are no external inputs like file reads or network connections, and no external data is sent elsewhere. All operations are standard data manipulations with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The commented-out print statements are benign debugging artifacts. No suspicious code or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple tuple creation from input lists without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a normal, safe utility function.",
