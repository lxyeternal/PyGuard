  "purpose": "Create a tuple pairing each word from a list with corresponding Gematria values.",
  "sources": "Input parameters ListOfWords and NW passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a tuple; no direct sinks of untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are combined into a tuple of pairs, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that zips two lists into a tuple of pairs, likely for further processing. It contains commented-out print statements for debugging and no external or untrusted data sources, external calls, or obfuscated logic. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. No external network, file, or environment variable usage is present. The code appears benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility function for pairing words with Gematria values, with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
