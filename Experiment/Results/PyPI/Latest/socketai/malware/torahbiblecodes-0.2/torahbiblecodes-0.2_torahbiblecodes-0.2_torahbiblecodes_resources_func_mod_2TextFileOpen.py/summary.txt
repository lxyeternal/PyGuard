  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a static data loader for biblical texts. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.2) are consistent with its behavior. The primary concern is maintainability, not security."
