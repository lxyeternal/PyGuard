{
  "purpose": "The code loads specific JSON files from a local directory based on an input parameter, returning their contents for further use.",
  "sources": "The code reads from hardcoded file paths within the 'resources/data/' directory, based on the value of 'TextChosen'.",
  "sinks": "The code only performs file reads; no untrusted data is processed beyond selecting files, and there are no external data sinks or network transmissions.",
  "flows": "The source is the 'TextChosen' parameter determining which files to load; the flow is from file opening and reading operations to returning the file contents as strings or tuples.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive repetitive conditional blocks for file selection, which is inefficient but not malicious. No obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static file loader that reads specific JSON files based on an integer input. It performs straightforward file I/O without dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation. The repetitive structure could be optimized, but no security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The reliance on hardcoded paths is a maintainability concern but not a security risk. No signs of obfuscation or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a static data loader for biblical texts. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.2) are consistent with its behavior. The primary concern is maintainability, not security.",
