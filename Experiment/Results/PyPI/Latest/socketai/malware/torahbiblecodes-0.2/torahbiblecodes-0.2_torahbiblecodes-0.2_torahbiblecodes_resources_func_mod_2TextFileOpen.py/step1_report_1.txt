{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes to load and read specific JSON text files, primarily biblical texts, from a local resources directory for further processing or display.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from local JSON files located in 'resources/data/' directory based on specific input parameters (e.g., TextChosen).",
  "sinks": "Data is read from files and stored in variables, then returned by functions. No untrusted data is written back to files, sent over network, or used in unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'TextChosen' determines which files are read; data flows from file I/O operations into in-memory variables, then returned by functions. No external or network data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes extensive conditional branches for loading specific files, which could lead to code bloat but does not inherently indicate malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed. No obfuscation, malicious injections, or hidden code are present. No dynamic execution or code injection techniques are employed.",
  "analysis": "The code's core functionality is to load predetermined JSON files based on input parameters. It uses standard file I/O operations with safe encoding. The approach of handling many specific files via conditional statements is verbose but not malicious. There are no network connections, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors. The code's structure is straightforward, focusing solely on file reading. No evidence of malicious intent or sabotage was found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for loading textual data files, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or malware. It is purely for data retrieval without any harmful side effects or malicious behavior. The design is verbose but safe.",
