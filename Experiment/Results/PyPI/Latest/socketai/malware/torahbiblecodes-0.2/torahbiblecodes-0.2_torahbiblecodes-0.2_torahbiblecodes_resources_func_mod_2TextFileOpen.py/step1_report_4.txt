{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to load Bible-related JSON data files and to open specific text files based on a given selection, primarily for reading and processing religious text data.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from files located in the 'resources/data/' directory, including individual JSON files and concatenated text files based on user input.",
  "sinks": "The file open operations are conducted with controlled filenames; no untrusted or external input is directly used in file operations within the provided code.",
  "flows": "The function 'fn_TextFileOpen' maps the input 'TextChosen' to specific file paths, reads the files, and returns their contents. No external user input influences the filenames dynamically; all filenames are hardcoded in if-elif conditions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is highly repetitive with extensive hardcoded filenames, which could be prone to maintenance errors but does not directly indicate malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The commented-out print statements suggest debugging remnants but no malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file reading based on static mappings from an integer input. There is no dynamic execution, no external input affecting filenames, and no use of untrusted data to construct file paths. The operations are straightforward file reads from predefined paths. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The structure is verbose and repetitive, indicating poor code practice but not malicious intent. No malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple, static file loader for religious texts with no indications of malicious activity, sabotage, or malware. It relies solely on hardcoded file paths and performs standard file I/O operations without external inputs influencing the file access dynamically.",
