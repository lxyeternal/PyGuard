{
  "purpose": "The function parses a JSON string, removes hyphens, brackets and their contents, and whitespace, then returns the cleaned strings.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'JSONString' which is a string expected to contain JSON data.",
  "sinks": "The code processes the input string and returns processed strings; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input JSONString -> Remove hyphens -> Remove brackets and contents -> Remove spaces -> Return processed strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The function performs straightforward string manipulations without external data access or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module and defines a function that cleans a JSON string by removing hyphens, brackets with their contents, and whitespace. There are multiple commented-out print statements used for debugging. The function's logic involves replacing hyphens with spaces, removing bracketed content via regex, and removing spaces altogether. Variable reuse and redundant assignments are present but do not impact security. There is no evidence of data leakage, malicious behavior, or external network activity. The code is simple and focused on string parsing without any external dependencies or system calls.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign string parsing function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs straightforward text processing with no suspicious behavior.",
