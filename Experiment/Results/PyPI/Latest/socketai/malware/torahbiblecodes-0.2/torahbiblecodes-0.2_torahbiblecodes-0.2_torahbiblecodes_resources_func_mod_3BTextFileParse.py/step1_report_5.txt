  "purpose": "Parse a JSON string to remove hyphens, brackets, and whitespace, returning two processed text strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameter JSONString, which is a string provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "The code processes the input string and returns processed strings; it does not perform any network operations, file operations, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Input JSONString -> Remove hyphens -> Remove bracket contents -> Remove spaces -> Return processed strings.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains multiple repeated comments and redundant variable assignments, but no signs of malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The function performs string manipulations: replacing hyphens with spaces, removing bracketed content via regex, and removing all spaces. The code is straightforward and only manipulates input data without external calls or insecure operations. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign text processing utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It processes input strings to clean or parse text data, likely for further use. No malicious behaviors or security issues are evident.",
