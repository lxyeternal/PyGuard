{
  "purpose": "The function 'fn_TextFileParse' processes a JSON string by replacing specific hyphen characters with spaces, removing bracketed content, and eliminating all spaces, returning two cleaned text variants.",
  "sources": "Input parameter JSONString; string replacement and regex operations within the function.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs in-memory string manipulations only, with no external data transmission or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input string -> hyphen replacement -> bracket removal via regex -> space removal -> return processed strings.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant variable assignments at the end of the function; commented-out print/debug statements; no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple string cleaning operations without external dependencies, dynamic code execution, or security-sensitive actions. The regex removes bracketed content, and replacements handle hyphens and spaces. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or network activity are present. The redundant variable assignments are benign but suggest potential for cleanup. Overall, the code is straightforward, transparent, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign string preprocessing utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
