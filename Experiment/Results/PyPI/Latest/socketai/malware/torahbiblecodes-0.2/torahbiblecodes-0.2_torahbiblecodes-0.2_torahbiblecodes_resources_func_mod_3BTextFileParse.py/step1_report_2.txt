{
  "purpose": "The function parses a JSON string, removing hyphens, brackets, and whitespace, and returns two processed text versions.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'JSONString' received by the function.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is written to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Input 'JSONString' -> hyphen replacement -> regex removal of brackets -> whitespace removal -> return processed strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs straightforward string processing without suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that manipulates strings by replacing specific characters and removing bracketed content using regex. No external input/output operations, network access, or code execution occurs. The processing logic is simple, and no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The function appears to be a standard text parsing utility with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for string processing with no signs of malware or security threats. It simply sanitizes input text, and its structure and behavior are consistent with standard parsing functions.",
