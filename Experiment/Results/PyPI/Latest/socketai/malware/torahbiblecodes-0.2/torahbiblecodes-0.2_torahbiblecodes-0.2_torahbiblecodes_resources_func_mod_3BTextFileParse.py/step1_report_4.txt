  "purpose": "The code defines a function to parse a JSON string by removing hyphens, brackets, and white spaces, returning the processed text.",
  "sources": "The input JSONString parameter, which is a string provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "The function processes and returns cleaned versions of the input string; no external or untrusted data flows outside the function.",
  "flows": "Input JSONString → removal of hyphens → removal of brackets and their contents → removal of spaces → return processed strings.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated commented-out print statements and redundant variable assignments. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are evident. No external network or file operations are present. No obfuscated code, malware, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward text processing without any external I/O, network activity, or secret handling. The only operations are string replacements and regex substitutions. Redundant code and comments suggest potential code maintenance issues but no malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs simple text cleaning on an input string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation appears benign, with no external data access or harmful operations.",
