{
  "purpose": "The function `fn_TextFileParse` processes a JSON string by removing hyphens, brackets with contents, and white spaces, then returns the cleaned strings with and without spaces.",
  "sources": "The input parameter `JSONString`, which is a string provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "The code only performs string manipulation and does not write data to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input string `JSONString` -> replace hyphens -> remove bracketed content -> remove spaces -> assign processed strings -> return tuples.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant variable assignments for `TextParsedWithSpaces` and `TextParsedNoSpaces`. The commented-out print statements suggest debugging but pose no security risk. No use of dynamic code execution or suspicious imports. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or potentially malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward string cleaning operations on the input JSON string: replacing hyphens with spaces, removing bracketed contents using regex, and removing all spaces. The commented print statements indicate debugging rather than malicious intent. There are no network operations, no file I/O, no eval or exec calls, nor other suspicious behaviors. Variable reassignments are redundant but benign. Overall, the code seems intended for data preprocessing without any malicious or security-sensitive actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign string processing function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely cleans input data for further processing. The redundant assignments and commented-out debugging statements are typical in development but do not indicate malicious intent.",
