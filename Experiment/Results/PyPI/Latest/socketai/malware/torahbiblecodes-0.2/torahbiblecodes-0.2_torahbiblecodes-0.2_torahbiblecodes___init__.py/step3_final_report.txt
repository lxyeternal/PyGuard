  "purpose": "Re-export classes from the faker library for external use.",

  "sinks": "None.",
  "flows": "Import statements without data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes, defines a version string, and exposes these classes via __all__. It contains no data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling. All reports correctly identify the benign, straightforward nature of this code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module for exposing classes from the faker library. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
