{
  "purpose": "Define and expose classes Factory, Generator, and Faker from the faker library for use in generating fake data.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from the faker library modules: faker.factory, faker.generator, faker.proxy.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no sinks that lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and then makes them available via __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code consists solely of import statements and a version constant.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from the faker package modules, assigns a version string, and defines __all__ for module exports. There are no input operations, no data processing, no network communication, or other suspicious activities. The code appears to be a simple module that re-exports classes from the faker library for use elsewhere. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module that re-exports classes from the faker library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply facilitates access to faker's core classes for generating fake data.",
