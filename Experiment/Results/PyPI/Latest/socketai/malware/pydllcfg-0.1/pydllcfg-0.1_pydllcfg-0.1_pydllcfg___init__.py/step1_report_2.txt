  "sources": "None, as there are no input functions or external data reads.",
  "sinks": "The print function outputs to standard output; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs a static print operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single print statement that outputs a static string. There are no inputs, no external data dependencies, no code injection points, and no dynamic or obfuscated code features. The simplicity indicates no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a basic output operation with no suspicious elements.",
