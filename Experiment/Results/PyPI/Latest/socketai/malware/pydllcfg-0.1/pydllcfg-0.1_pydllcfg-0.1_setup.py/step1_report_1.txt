{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process to download and execute an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe' for downloading the file.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file 'CBLines.exe' is executed using PowerShell's Start-Process, which could execute malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading the URL (source) to downloading the file, then opening/running the file (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes automatically downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation; hardcoded URL and execution of remote content are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard install process to download an executable from a remote URL, then immediately runs it using PowerShell commands. This behavior is atypical and poses security risks. The URL points to a binary executable hosted on GitHub, which could contain malicious code. Executing this file without user consent or verification is a significant security concern. No other dependencies or code obfuscation techniques are present. The code's intent appears to be to install a package while also executing arbitrary code from the internet, which could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation, which is highly suspicious and potentially harmful. This pattern is consistent with malware or supply chain attacks.",
