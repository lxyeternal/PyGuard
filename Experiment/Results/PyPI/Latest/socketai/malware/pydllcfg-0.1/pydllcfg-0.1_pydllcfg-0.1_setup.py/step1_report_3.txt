  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to download and execute an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a URL ('https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe') via PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest.",
  "sinks": "The code opens the downloaded executable file using PowerShell's Start-Process, which could execute malicious code.",
  "flows": "Source: Download URL via Invoke-WebRequest -> Sink: Executing the downloaded file with Start-Process.",
  "anomalies": "The script downloads an executable file during installation and automatically runs it without user consent or verification, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard setuptools install command to include steps that download an executable from an external URL and then execute it. The download is performed silently using PowerShell commands, and the executable is run immediately after download. This behavior resembles malicious tactics such as dropping and executing malware during package installation. No verification or integrity checks are performed on the downloaded file. The process leverages common package setup mechanisms but includes suspicious behavior that can compromise user systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation, which could lead to system compromise or malicious activities. It demonstrates a clear supply chain attack vector.",
