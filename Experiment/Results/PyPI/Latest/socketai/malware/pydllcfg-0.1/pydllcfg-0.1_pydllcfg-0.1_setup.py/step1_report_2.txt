{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe' used in Invoke-WebRequest, and the subsequent invocation of Start-Process to run the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via Start-Process which may run arbitrary code on the host system.",
  "flows": "Download command retrieves a remote executable, saved as 'CBLines.exe', then executed immediately, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from a remote source and runs it automatically during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious. No validation or checksum is performed on the downloaded file. The filename 'CBLines.exe' and its source URL are suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard setuptools install process to include additional steps. It constructs a PowerShell command to download an executable from a remote URL and saves it locally. If successful, it immediately launches the executable without any validation. This behavior can facilitate remote code execution, malware installation, or backdoor establishment. The code's intent appears malicious, as it silently downloads and executes external code during package installation, which is a common tactic for supply chain attacks. There are no checks for integrity, authenticity, or user consent. The approach is highly suspicious and aligns with malicious behavior patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation without validation or user consent. This strongly suggests malicious intent, likely to compromise systems where the package is installed.",
