{
  "purpose": "During package installation, the code downloads an executable from a remote URL and executes it without validation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe' used in Invoke-WebRequest; the subprocess.run calls executing PowerShell commands.",
  "sinks": "The 'Invoke-WebRequest' command downloads the executable; 'Start-Process' executes the downloaded file, leading to potential remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Code constructs PowerShell command to download the executable from the URL, saves it as 'CBLines.exe', then executes it via 'Start-Process' without validation.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate execution of remote executable during installation without checksum or user consent; use of PowerShell commands with hardcoded URL; no validation or error handling for the downloaded file.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'install' command to perform a remote download and execution of an external executable during package setup. It constructs PowerShell commands with hardcoded URL, runs them via subprocess with shell=True, and proceeds with standard installation afterward. This pattern is highly suspicious and characteristic of supply chain attacks or malware distribution. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and performs actions that could compromise system security. The behavior aligns with malicious activity, and the high malware and security risk scores are justified. The lack of validation or user consent further increases the threat level. The scores should be at the maximum (malware: 1, security risk: 1) to reflect the severity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during installation without validation, indicating a high probability of malicious intent. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack patterns, warranting maximum security concern.",
