{
  "purpose": "Custom installation script that downloads and executes an external executable during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the internet via Invoke-WebRequest to download a file from a specified URL.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file is executed using Start-Process, which could run malicious code if the file is harmful.",
  "flows": "The flow is from internet download (source) to executing the downloaded file (sink), which could lead to remote or local malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "The script downloads a file from a URL and immediately executes it without verification or validation, which is suspicious. Using PowerShell commands to download and execute files during package install is highly unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the installation process of a Python package to run custom commands. It downloads an executable ('CBLines.exe') from a remote URL and then opens/runs it directly. This behavior resembles malicious supply chain tactics, where code is downloaded and executed without user consent or verification. The script lacks any checksum validation, authentication, or integrity checks for the downloaded file. The execution of an external executable during package installation poses high security risks and potential malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation without validation, indicating high likelihood of malicious intent and security risk. This pattern is characteristic of supply chain attacks or malware distribution.",
