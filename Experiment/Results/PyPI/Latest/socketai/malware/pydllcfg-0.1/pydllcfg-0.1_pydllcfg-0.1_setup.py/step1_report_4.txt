{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup script that, during installation, downloads and executes an external executable file from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe' used in Invoke-WebRequest; the subprocess.run calls executing PowerShell commands.",
  "sinks": "The PowerShell commands that download and execute the remote executable; especially the 'Start-Process' command that runs the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "The code fetches a file from the specified URL, saves it as 'CBLines.exe', then executes it via PowerShell during the installation process.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of the installation script to download and execute an external executable; hardcoded URL; executing downloaded content without verification; use of PowerShell to run arbitrary code.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard installation process to download an executable from a remote source and immediately runs it, which is suspicious and potentially malicious behavior. It does not verify the downloaded file's integrity or origin, and executing remote code during package installation is a significant security risk. The download URL appears to point to a potentially malicious executable, and the script automatically opens this file, indicating intent to run code outside the package's scope. This pattern aligns with techniques used in supply chain attacks or malware delivery, especially as it runs during package setup. No other dependencies or benign code are present to mitigate this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation without validation. This represents a high security risk and indicates potential malware or supply chain attack activity.",
