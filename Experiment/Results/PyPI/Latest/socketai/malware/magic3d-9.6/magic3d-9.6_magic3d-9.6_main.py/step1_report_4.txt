  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory, and generate a random number, then send this data to multiple external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function, random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with encoded parameters",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, MAC addresses, random number) are encoded and sent via URL parameters to external servers through HTTP requests",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple URLs with obfuscated subdomains, encoding of MAC addresses, and silent exception handling during network requests; the URLs appear suspicious and could be used for tracking or data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The script collects device-specific information and encodes MAC addresses in base64, then sends this data to potentially malicious domains. The URLs are obfuscated and suspicious, likely used for tracking or data collection. The code does not perform any destructive actions but can be used to fingerprint or track users without consent. Exception handling suppresses errors, which is common in malicious code to avoid detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect system information covertly and send it to suspicious external servers. While it does not contain explicit malicious payloads like system damage or data theft, its behavior suggests potential privacy violations and tracking, warranting caution.",
