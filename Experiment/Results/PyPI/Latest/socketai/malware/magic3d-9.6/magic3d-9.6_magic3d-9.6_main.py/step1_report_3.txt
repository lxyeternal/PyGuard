  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send it to remote servers via encoded URL parameters.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (reading network interface info), random.randint() (generating a number), and the URL request built with user/system data.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls sending data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, path, MAC addresses) are gathered, encoded in base64, and included as URL parameters, then sent to remote servers via HTTP GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple URLs with suspicious domain names, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and URL parameters including system and user info suggest data exfiltration. The URL domains are potentially malicious or obfuscated. The code does not perform any validation or sanitization of data before transmission. Exception handling suppresses errors without logging.",
  "analysis": "The script collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses across different OSes. It encodes the MAC addresses using base64, then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains, appending system data as URL parameters. The data is transmitted via HTTP GET requests without any encryption or validation. The presence of obscure URLs and the exfiltration of user and network information without user consent strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially for surveillance or data theft. No obvious obfuscation of code logic beyond standard Python functions, but the data collection and transmission pattern is suspicious. There is no indication of malicious code execution beyond data exfiltration; however, the malicious behavior is clear due to data leakage to untrusted external servers.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for malicious data collection and exfiltration, possibly for surveillance or other malicious purposes. It gathers detailed system information, encodes it, and transmits it to external domains, which are suspicious and likely malicious. The overall security risk is high, with potential privacy violations and data theft. No obfuscation detected, but the intent and behavior are malicious.",
