  "purpose": "To set up and install the 'magic3d' Python package, executing a custom installation step that runs a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools and custom install class, and the invocation of 'main()' from main.py within the CrazyInstallStrat.run() method.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'main()' from main.py as part of the installation process, which could potentially execute arbitrary code during package installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run() method executes and imports main, then calls main(), creating a source-to-sink path where arbitrary code could run if main.py contains malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The execution of main() during the installation process is unusual and potentially malicious, especially if main.py contains untrusted or malicious code. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package setup parameters. The custom install class CrazyInstallStrat overrides run() to execute the main() function from main.py during installation. This behavior is non-standard and could allow malicious code to run automatically when the package is installed. No other suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. The rest of the setup is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the execution of main() from main.py during installation, which could run malicious code. This pattern is suspicious and should be reviewed, especially if main.py is untrusted. Otherwise, the code appears to be a standard setup script with an unusual post-install step.",
