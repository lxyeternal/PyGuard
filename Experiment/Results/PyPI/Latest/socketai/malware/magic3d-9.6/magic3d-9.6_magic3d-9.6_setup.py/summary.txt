  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and poses a security risk, especially if 'main.py' is untrusted or malicious. While the code itself is benign, this behavior can be exploited for malicious purposes. Therefore, it warrants caution and further inspection of 'main.py'."
