{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'magic3d' Python package that customizes the installation process to run a function from the 'main' module after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports modules and defines a class. The potentially suspicious part is the dynamic import and execution of 'main' from 'main.py' in the run method.",
  "sinks": "The code executes 'main()' from 'main.py' during installation, which could be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method imports 'main' from 'main.py' and executes it, which may execute arbitrary code at install time.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' executes 'main()' from 'main' during installation. The class name itself is unusual, potentially indicating malicious intent. No other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation class that overrides the 'run' method to execute 'main()' from a local module 'main'. This can be exploited to run malicious code during installation if 'main.py' contains malicious payloads. No other suspicious behaviors, such as network calls, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code, are present. The code structure appears typical for a setup script, but the forced execution of 'main()' on install is a security concern, especially if 'main.py' is untrusted or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a normal setup process with an unusual and potentially malicious step of executing 'main()' during installation. This could be used to run arbitrary code at install time, posing a security risk. The overall risk is moderate, primarily due to the dynamic execution during install.",
