{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package and executes the 'main()' function from 'main.py' during installation via a custom install class.",
  "sources": "Import of 'main' in the 'run()' method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during the install process.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the code imports 'main' and executes 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual execution of arbitrary code during setup; class name 'CrazyInstallStrat' is unconventional.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses a custom install class that, after completing the standard installation, imports and runs 'main()'. This pattern is non-standard and can be exploited to execute malicious code if 'main.py' contains harmful instructions. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The behavior is suspicious because executing external code during setup can lead to supply chain attacks. The code itself is straightforward, but the potential for malicious payloads depends on the content of 'main.py'.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and poses a security risk, especially if 'main.py' is untrusted or malicious. While the code itself is benign, this behavior can be exploited for malicious purposes. Therefore, it warrants caution and further inspection of 'main.py'.",
