      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and poses a security risk, especially if 'main.py' is untrusted or malicious. While the code itself is benign, this behavior can be exploited for malicious purposes. Therefore, it warrants caution and further inspection of 'main.py'."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a covert data exfiltration or tracking tool, collecting system identifiers and transmitting them to suspicious external servers. While it does not execute destructive payloads, its purpose is malicious, aimed at privacy invasion and unauthorized data collection. The overall security risk and malware likelihood are high due to these behaviors."
