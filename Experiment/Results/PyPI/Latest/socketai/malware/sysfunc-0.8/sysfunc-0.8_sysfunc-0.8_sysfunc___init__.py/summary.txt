  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Pyarmor obfuscation/license enforcement wrapper, not malicious in itself. However, the encrypted payload passed to __pyarmor__ in the last report is suspicious and could conceal malicious activity. The high obfuscation and encrypted data justify a high malware score (around 0.75) and security risk (around 0.8). The other reports correctly identify the pattern as typical for protected code, with no malicious activity detected."
