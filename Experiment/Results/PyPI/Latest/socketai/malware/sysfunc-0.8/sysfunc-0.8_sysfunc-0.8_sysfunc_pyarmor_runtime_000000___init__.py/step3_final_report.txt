{
  "purpose": "Import of the Pyarmor runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or licensing verification.",
  "sources": "The import statement `from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__`",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "The code imports a module; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement referencing a local module related to Pyarmor, accompanied by a comment indicating a trial version. No malicious activity, data leaks, network activity, or suspicious behavior are evident. The import suggests the use of obfuscation or licensing mechanisms, which are standard in protected scripts. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.1, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious intent are detected. The code's simplicity and context support a conclusion of no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as part of a protected or obfuscated script using Pyarmor. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
