  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code snippets, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe a very minimal code snippet: an import statement of `__pyarmor__` from a local module `pyarmor_runtime`.\n- The comments indicate the use of Pyarmor 9.0.6 (trial), which is a legitimate obfuscation/protection tool.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, network activity, or suspicious code is observed.\n- The code is consistent with standard practices for protected scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import of `__pyarmor__` runtime module, likely for obfuscation/license verification.\n- **Findings:** No data flows, no sinks, no anomalies beyond the license comment.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard obfuscation-related import.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The minimal code and the comment about a trial version do not indicate malicious intent. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No data leaks, no suspicious patterns, standard import.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate obfuscation use, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.1, Risk 0.1, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The obfuscated score is slightly higher but still low, reflecting the presence of obfuscation but no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No data flow, no suspicious code, only a license comment.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard use of Pyarmor, no security concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.2, Risk 0.1, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The obfuscated score is slightly higher, possibly because the import relates to code protection, but this is justified and not concerning.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No malicious patterns, only a license comment.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical protected script, no security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.1, Risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, only an import statement with a license comment.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard obfuscation use, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The zero obfuscated score aligns with the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which is correct given the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable, reflecting the use of an obfuscation tool.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1 or 0), consistent with the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence levels:** High (0.9), justified by the clear and minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Adjustments & Justifications**\n- The obfuscated scores could be uniformly set to 0.1 since the code is very minimal and standard, and the obfuscation is implied but not complex.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low; no change needed.\n- Malware scores are correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.1 for all, reflecting standard obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 or 0, given the lack of any suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code snippets are standard for protected scripts using Pyarmor, with no malicious intent or activity detected. The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.1\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.",
