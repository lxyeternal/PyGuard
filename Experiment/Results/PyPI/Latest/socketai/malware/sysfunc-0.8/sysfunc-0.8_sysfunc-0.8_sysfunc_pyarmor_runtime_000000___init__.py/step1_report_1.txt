{
  "purpose": "The code imports the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely to execute or verify code obfuscation or licensing features related to the Pyarmor protection tool.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data leaks or external data flows observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow observed; the import is static and does not process untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "The only comment indicates a trial version of Pyarmor with an expiration date; no suspicious or malicious code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement of a protected runtime module associated with Pyarmor. The comment indicates it's a trial version, which suggests code protection but does not imply malicious intent. There are no visible code execution, data handling, or network activities. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present beyond licensing information.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply imports a runtime module related to Pyarmor obfuscation protection. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
