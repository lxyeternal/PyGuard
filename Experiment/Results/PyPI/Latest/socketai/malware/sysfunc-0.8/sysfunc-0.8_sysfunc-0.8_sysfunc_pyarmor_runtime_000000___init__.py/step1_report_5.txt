  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ module from the pyarmor_runtime package, likely for runtime obfuscation or licensing enforcement.",

  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions",
  "flows": "The imported __pyarmor__ object may be used later in the code for runtime operations, but no flow is demonstrated in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating trial version and date, but no malicious or suspicious code features are visible",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a specific module (__pyarmor__) from a relative package (pyarmor_runtime). The comment suggests this is part of obfuscation or licensing management. No data input, output, or dangerous behaviors are present. No unusual code patterns or secrets are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard import statement related to obfuscation or licensing. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident in this snippet.",
