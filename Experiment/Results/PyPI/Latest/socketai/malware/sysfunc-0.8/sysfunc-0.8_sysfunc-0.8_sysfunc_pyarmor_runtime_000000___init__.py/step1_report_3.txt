{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ attribute from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for obfuscation or licensing management purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only a straightforward import statement",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating trial software; no suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement importing __pyarmor__ from a relative module. The comment references Pyarmor trial version and a timestamp, but the code itself does not perform any actions, data processing, or network communication. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious functions, or unusual patterns. The import suggests use of Pyarmor for code obfuscation or licensing, which is common in protected Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard import related to code obfuscation or licensing protection. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
