{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ attribute from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or runtime protection purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'pyarmor_runtime' to access __pyarmor__.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Import statement reads 'pyarmor_runtime' module, which could be used for runtime protection; no data flows to external systems or effects are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of Pyarmor version comment indicating software obfuscation or protection; no suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation techniques beyond version info.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with an accompanying comment about Pyarmor 9.0.6, a legitimate obfuscation tool. It only imports __pyarmor__ from pyarmor_runtime, which is typical in obfuscated or protected Python scripts. No malicious patterns, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code execution, are evident. The comment indicates usage of a trial version, but this alone does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be part of a protected or obfuscated script utilizing Pyarmor. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of the import and version comment is consistent with legitimate use of the Pyarmor tool.",
