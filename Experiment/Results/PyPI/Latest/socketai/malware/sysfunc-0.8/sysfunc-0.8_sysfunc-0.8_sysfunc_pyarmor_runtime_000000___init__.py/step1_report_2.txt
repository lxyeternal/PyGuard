  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module for code obfuscation and protection purposes.",
  "sources": "The module is imported from a relative package, indicating it is a local or embedded resource.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates the use of Pyarmor 9.0.6 (trial), which is a legitimate obfuscation tool. The code is minimal and standard for protected scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific module, likely part of an obfuscation or runtime protection system. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The presence of the comment about Pyarmor is standard for protected scripts. No other code or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement for a runtime module used in code obfuscation and does not exhibit malicious behavior. It appears to be part of a protected or obfuscated script, with no security concerns identified.",
