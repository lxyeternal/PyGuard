  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for a Python package named 'sysfunc' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata defined within setup(), no external data sources or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup.py script importing setuptools, defining package metadata, and calling setup() with fixed parameters. No dynamic elements, external data, or malicious constructs are present. The author name 'Hosne432' appears as a username but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious activity or security concerns. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
