  "purpose": "This setup.py script is intended to configure and install a Python package named 'sysfunc' that interacts with system functions.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; primarily reads package metadata and filesystem for package discovery and inclusion.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; standard package setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup with standard fields. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for packaging, defines package metadata, and configures package discovery with find_packages(). No dynamic code execution, environment variable manipulation, or external network activity. The author field contains a username but no suspicious or malicious content. The use of Python 3.12 is specified, indicating up-to-date dependency requirements. Overall, this is a typical setup script without signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a standard package configuration script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for Python package distribution.",
