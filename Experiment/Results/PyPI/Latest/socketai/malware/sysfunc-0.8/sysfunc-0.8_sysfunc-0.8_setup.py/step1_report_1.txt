{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script is used to configure the packaging and distribution of a Python library named 'sysfunc'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package configuration data such as package name, version, author, and Python version requirement.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data or input could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The script flows from defining package metadata to executing the setup function, with no external data flow or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "The author name 'Hosne432' appears as a non-standard or suspicious username but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py file used for packaging a Python library. It specifies package metadata, requirements, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, user input, or external data handling is present. The author string does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. It is a minimal and typical setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard boilerplate code for package distribution.",
