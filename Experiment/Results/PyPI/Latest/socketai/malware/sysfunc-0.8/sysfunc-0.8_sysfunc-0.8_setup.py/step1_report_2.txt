{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script is used for packaging a Python library named 'sysfunc' for distribution via PyPI or other package repositories.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata such as name, version, author, and Python compatibility requirements.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; the script only defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "The script takes static metadata and uses setuptools to prepare the package; no external data flow or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code appears to be a standard setup script with typical fields. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, defines a package configuration with static values, and calls setup() with fixed parameters. There are no dynamic or user-input-dependent parts, no code execution beyond package setup, and no obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors. The package name, author, and other metadata are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
