  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for packaging the 'sysfunc' Python library.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function such as package name, version, author, description, classifiers, and package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or input handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink due to static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard setup script with no unusual constructs or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup.py file used for packaging a Python library. It imports setuptools, specifies package metadata, and uses find_packages() to include all packages. All fields are static, well-formed, and typical for a setup script. No code injection, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior is present. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no network activity, or other indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py is a standard packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate for the purpose of distributing the 'sysfunc' package.",
