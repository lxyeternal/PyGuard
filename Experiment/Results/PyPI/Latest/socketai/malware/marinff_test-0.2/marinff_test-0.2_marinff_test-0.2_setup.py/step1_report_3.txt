{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package installation process that, during installation, executes a reverse shell command intended to connect back to a specified IP and port.",
  "sources": "The reverse shell command constructed within the CustomInstall class run() method, particularly the LHOST and LPORT variables used to generate the command, and the os.system call executing the base64-decoded script.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing a base64-decoded Python reverse shell command that establishes a network connection back to a remote server, potentially allowing remote command execution and control.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command with specified IP and port, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system, creating a source-to-sink flow from the variable assignment to the remote connection.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes embedding a reverse shell payload in the setup process, base64 encoding the payload, and executing it during installation, which is atypical for standard package setup scripts. Hardcoded IP and port are also suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, upon running, constructs a reverse shell command with hardcoded IP and port. It encodes this command in base64, then decodes and executes it using os.system. The reverse shell, implemented in Python, connects back to a remote server, providing remote control capabilities. Such behavior is highly unusual and malicious in the context of a package installation, indicating intentional backdoor functionality designed for remote access. The use of base64 encoding is likely to obfuscate the payload, which is a common tactic in malicious code. No other benign or functional code appears relevant; the primary malicious behavior is the embedded reverse shell that executes automatically during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious backdoor that initiates a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port during package installation. This behavior indicates an intentional security threat, likely used for unauthorized remote access. The obfuscation via base64 encoding further suggests malicious intent.",
