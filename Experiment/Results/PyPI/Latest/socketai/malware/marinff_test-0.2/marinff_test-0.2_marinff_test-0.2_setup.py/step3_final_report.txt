{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to establish a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port during package installation, indicating malicious intent to gain remote control access.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded IP (LHOST) and port (LPORT), constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, and executes it via os.system during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes the decoded base64 payload, which opens a network connection and spawns a shell, potentially allowing remote code execution and system control.",
  "flows": "Input: Hardcoded IP and port -> Base64-encoded reverse shell command -> Decoded and executed via os.system -> Reverse shell connection established.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a typo in 'socket' as 'secket', which would cause a runtime error; use of base64 encoding to obfuscate malicious payload; execution during setup process without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a reverse shell payload with hardcoded parameters, encodes it in base64, and executes it during installation, which is a typical malicious backdoor technique. The typo in 'secket' would prevent execution unless corrected, but the malicious intent remains clear. The use of base64 obfuscation and execution during setup indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~1, obfuscated ~0.8-1, security risk ~1) are consistent with this behavior. The code's purpose is to allow remote control, representing a severe security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to establish a reverse shell during package installation, with obfuscation via base64 encoding. Despite a typo that would prevent execution, the intent is clear and severe. The package poses a high security risk and should be flagged as malicious.",
