{
  "purpose": "The code installs a Python package and executes a reverse shell upon installation.",
  "sources": "LHOST and LPORT variables, reverse_shell string, encoded base64 command, os.system call",
  "sinks": "os.system command executing decoded base64 reverse shell script",
  "flows": "Reverse shell string is encoded in base64, decoded by os.system, then executed, establishing a reverse shell connection",
  "anomalies": "Embedding a reverse shell command within a setup script, encoding it in base64 to obfuscate behavior, executing it automatically upon installation",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that, during the installation process, constructs a reverse shell command targeting a specific IP and port. It encodes this command in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system. This behavior is hidden within the setup routine, automatically triggering a reverse shell connection to the specified IP address upon package installation, indicating malicious intent. No validation or user consent is sought before executing the reverse shell, and the code uses obfuscation techniques (base64 encoding) to conceal malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code intentionally includes a hidden reverse shell that automatically connects to a specified IP address during installation, representing malicious behavior designed for unauthorized remote access. This constitutes a high security risk.",
