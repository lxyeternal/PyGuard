{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package that, upon installation, executes a reverse shell to a specified IP address and port.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded IP address '172.19.132.154' and port 8867; Base64-encoded reverse shell command; os.system call executing decoded base64 string.",
  "sinks": "os.system command executing decoded base64 payload, which runs a reverse shell script.",
  "flows": "Reverse shell command is encoded in base64, decoded during installation, and executed via os.system, establishing a network connection to attacker-controlled IP and port.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code: embeds reverse shell payload within setup script; encodes payload in base64 to obfuscate; executes shell command during package installation; hardcoded attacker IP and port.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during package installation, constructs a reverse shell command targeting a fixed IP and port. The command is encoded in base64 for obfuscation, then decoded and executed via os.system, resulting in a reverse shell connection. This behavior is malicious, as it creates a backdoor upon package installation. The code uses standard setup tools but manipulates installation flow for malicious intent, which is suspicious and maliciously obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious backdoor that initiates a reverse shell during package installation, with obfuscated execution. The hardcoded IP, port, and use of base64 encoding are suspicious. Overall, this is malicious code intended for unauthorized remote access.",
