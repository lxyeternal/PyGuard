  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "LHOST, LPORT, reverse_shell string, base64 encoded string, os.system call",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing base64-decoded shell command, socket connection, pty spawn",
  "flows": "Encoded reverse shell command is decoded and piped into bash, which establishes a reverse shell to LHOST:LPORT",
  "anomalies": "Code automatically executes a potentially malicious reverse shell during installation, hardcoded IP and port, use of base64 encoding to obfuscate command, misuse of os.system for execution",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that runs the standard install process, then constructs a reverse shell command targeting a specific IP and port. This command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via os.system, resulting in the establishment of a reverse shell to the attacker-controlled server. The IP address and port are hardcoded, indicating malicious intent to compromise systems that install this package. The reverse shell uses Python sockets, pty.spawn, and environment variable manipulation to gain shell access. The obfuscation via base64 and direct execution via os.system suggests malicious intent, likely intended for remote code execution upon installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior designed to establish a reverse shell during package installation. It hardcodes attacker-controlled IP and port, decodes and executes obfuscated shell commands, and manipulates environment variables for stealth. Overall, this package is malicious and should be considered dangerous.",
