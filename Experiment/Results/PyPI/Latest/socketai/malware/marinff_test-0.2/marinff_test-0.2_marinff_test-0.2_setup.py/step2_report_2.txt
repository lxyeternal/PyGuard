  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Presence of issues:** Yes, the code executes a reverse shell during installation.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The report notes a typo in `'secket.AF_INET'` which would cause a runtime error, but this does not negate the malicious intent. The core logic remains malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all 1, which seem appropriate given the malicious behavior.\n- **Justification for scores:** The code actively establishes a reverse shell, which is highly malicious, justifying maximum scores.\n- **Additional notes:** The code is clearly malicious, with obfuscation via base64, hardcoded IP/port, and execution during setup.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Presence of issues:** Yes, the code creates a reverse shell during install.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The typo `'secket'` is noted, which would cause a runtime error, but the core intent is malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0.9, obfuscated at 0, risk at 0.9. These are reasonable; the slight deduction from perfect scores accounts for the typo that would prevent execution.\n- **Justification:** The core behavior is malicious, and the obfuscation is minimal but present, so scores are appropriate.\n- **Additional notes:** The report correctly identifies the malicious intent and obfuscation.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Presence of issues:** Yes, reverse shell during installation.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The report mentions a typo in `'secket'`, which would cause a runtime error, but the malicious intent remains clear.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0.9, obfuscated at 0.8, risk at 1. These seem reasonable; the slight reduction in malware score accounts for the typo.\n- **Justification:** The behavior is malicious, with obfuscation, so high scores are justified.\n- **Additional notes:** The report correctly assesses the malicious nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Presence of issues:** Yes, reverse shell code embedded in setup.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No specific errors noted, but the behavior is clearly malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk at 1, obfuscated at 0.8, which is consistent.\n- **Justification:** The code's purpose is malicious, establishing a backdoor during install.\n- **Additional notes:** The analysis aligns with the malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Presence of issues:** Yes, reverse shell during installation.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No errors noted, behavior is malicious.\n- **Scores:** All at 1, consistent with the malicious intent.\n- **Justification:** The code automatically connects to an attacker-controlled IP during setup, which is highly malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports identify the core malicious behavior: establishing a reverse shell during package installation.\n- The obfuscation varies but is generally present or implied.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the severity of the malicious activity.\n- The typo `'secket'` in reports 2 and 3 would prevent execution, but the core intent remains malicious; the scores reflect this.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n**Malware score:** 1 — the code clearly aims to establish a reverse shell, a classic backdoor behavior.\n**Obfuscated score:** 0.8 — obfuscation via base64 is evident, though not highly complex.\n**Risk score:** 1 — this behavior is highly dangerous, constituting a severe security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is malicious, actively establishing a reverse shell during installation, with obfuscation to conceal this behavior. The hardcoded IP and port, combined with execution during setup, make this a serious supply chain security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- The scores should remain at maximum (1) for malware and risk, given the clear malicious intent.  \n- Obfuscation score can be slightly below 1 if the obfuscation is minimal, but since base64 encoding is used, 0.8 is justified.  \n- The typo does not negate the malicious intent but indicates a possible bug; it should be fixed in production but does not reduce the malicious nature.\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis package should be flagged as malicious, and its distribution should be halted until thoroughly investigated and remediated.",
