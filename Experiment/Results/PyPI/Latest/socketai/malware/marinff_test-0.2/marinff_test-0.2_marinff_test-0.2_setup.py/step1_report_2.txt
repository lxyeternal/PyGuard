{
  "purpose": "This setup script is intended to install a Python module and then establish a reverse shell connection to a specified attacker-controlled IP and port upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the hardcoded IP address (LHOST), port number (LPORT), and constructs a reverse shell command, which is then base64-encoded.",
  "sinks": "The encoded reverse shell command is decoded and executed directly via os.system, resulting in the potential creation of a reverse shell back to the attacker.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded IP and port -> Reverse shell command construction -> Base64 encoding -> Decoding during execution -> os.system call to execute the command",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a reverse shell payload embedded in the install process, hardcoded IP and port, and execution of system commands during installation. The code also contains a typo in 'socket' (misspelled as 'secket') which would cause runtime error, but this does not negate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during the installation process, creates a reverse shell connection to a fixed IP address and port. It encodes this command in base64 to obfuscate its content and then executes it directly with os.system. The intent appears to be to establish a remote access backdoor during the package installation, which is malicious. The hardcoded IP and port, combined with executing a reverse shell payload, constitute a significant security risk. The typo in 'socket' indicates a potential bug, but the core malicious intent remains evident. The overall structure and payload are typical of malicious code designed for unauthorized access.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious intent by establishing a reverse shell connection during package installation, using obfuscation and hardcoded parameters. It poses a high security risk and should be considered malicious malware. The script's behavior is consistent with backdoor or remote access trojan functionalities.",
