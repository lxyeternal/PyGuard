  "purpose": "A simple script that prints 'hello world' to the console.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading points present.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs data to the console; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code executes a straightforward function call.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in the conditional statement: '=' should be '==', which may cause a runtime error, but no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'hello' that prints a message. The main guard has a syntax error ('=' instead of '==') which prevents proper execution. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations. The error appears to be a simple typo rather than obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a basic, benign example intended to print a greeting. The syntax error needs correction for proper execution but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, there is no malware or security risk present.",
