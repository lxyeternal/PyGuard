{
  "purpose": "A simple function to print 'hello world' when executed as the main program.",
  "sources": "Input sources are none; the code does not read external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "Output sink is the print statement, which outputs to the console.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: when executed, it calls the hello() function and prints the message.",
  "anomalies": "There is a syntax error in the if statement ('=' should be '=='), which would prevent execution; no malicious behavior or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that prints a message. The main block attempts to run this function if the script is executed directly, but contains a syntax mistake. No external data is read, no data is leaked, and there are no suspicious or malicious activities. The error is a simple typo rather than malicious obfuscation or backdoor.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic, benign script with a syntax error. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks, just a typo that prevents execution.",
