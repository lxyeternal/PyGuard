{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'noway-back' and includes custom installation behavior that loads and executes code from a ZIP file during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the ZIP file 'zip.zip' during the 'test' function execution in the 'run' method of class 'N'.",
  "sinks": "The code executes 'zip_importer.exec_module(module)' and calls 'module.hello()', which could execute arbitrary code from the ZIP file.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method loads 'zip.zip', imports a module from it, and calls its 'hello()' function, which could execute malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes dynamically loading and executing code from an external ZIP file during package installation, which is uncommon and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package setup. It overrides the 'install' command with class 'N' which, upon running, calls the 'test()' function. The 'test()' function loads a ZIP archive 'zip.zip' as a module and executes its 'hello()' method. This behavior can be used to execute arbitrary code during installation. Since the ZIP file contents are not verified, this introduces a significant security risk. The code does not validate or sanitize the ZIP contents, nor does it specify where 'zip.zip' comes from. The rest of the setup code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code's core malicious potential stems from executing code contained within an external ZIP file during package installation, which can be used to run malicious code without user awareness. The approach is suspicious and potentially dangerous, indicating a high security risk.",
