{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'noway-back', with a custom install command that executes a test function during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file; the test() function loads and executes code from 'zip.zip' using zipimport; the zip.zip file is imported and executed during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The module executed from 'zip.zip' via zipimport potentially executes arbitrary code; no explicit data sinks like network or file writing are directly visible, but executing external modules can lead to code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The setup script calls test() during installation, which imports and executes code from 'zip.zip' via zipimport, then calls module.hello(). This flow could lead to arbitrary code execution if 'zip.zip' contains malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of zipimport to dynamically load and execute code from a zip archive during package installation; no clear purpose for this behavior, potential for malicious code execution; the test() function dynamically loads code without verification.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file, then defines a test() function that loads a zip archive 'zip.zip' via zipimport, executes it, and calls its hello() function. The custom install class runs test() during installation. This dynamic code loading from an external archive introduces significant risk, especially since there's no validation or checksum verification of 'zip.zip'. The setup process executes potentially untrusted code during installation, which could be malicious. The rest of the setup defines package metadata and data, which appears standard. The core concern is the dynamic execution of code from 'zip.zip' in the test() function, which can be exploited to run malicious code silently during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-risk pattern of dynamically importing and executing code from an external zip archive during installation, which could be exploited to run malicious code. This behavior poses a significant security risk, and such dynamic code execution should be avoided or carefully validated. Overall, the package exhibits malicious potential due to the unverified code execution during setup.",
