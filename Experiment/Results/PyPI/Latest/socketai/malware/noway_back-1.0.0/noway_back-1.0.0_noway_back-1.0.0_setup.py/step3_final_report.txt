{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically loads and executes a module from an external ZIP archive ('zip.zip') during installation, calling its 'hello()' function.",
  "sources": "The 'test()' function reads 'zip.zip' via zipimport.zipimporter and loads the 'zip' module.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'module.hello()' executes code from the external ZIP archive, potentially running malicious code.",
  "flows": "The 'test()' function loads 'zip.zip' and executes 'module.hello()', which can perform arbitrary actions during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Loading and executing code from an external archive ('zip.zip') during package installation without validation or verification.",
  "analysis": "The code executes external code during setup by loading 'zip.zip' via zipimport and calling its 'hello()' function. This pattern is unusual and risky, as it can run malicious code if 'zip.zip' is compromised. The code does not perform any validation, checksum, or signature verification on the external archive. The behavior aligns with techniques used in supply chain attacks to execute malicious payloads during installation. The pattern is straightforward but dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution with high privileges during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern presents a high security risk due to executing unverified external code during setup, which could be malicious. The behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, warranting a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9. This pattern should be flagged as highly dangerous and avoided unless the external ZIP is fully trusted and validated.",
