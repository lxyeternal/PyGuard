  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, non-malicious configuration with suspicious metadata that could be used for social engineering or misrepresentation. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present in this code. The security risk is low, but metadata should be verified before distribution. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
