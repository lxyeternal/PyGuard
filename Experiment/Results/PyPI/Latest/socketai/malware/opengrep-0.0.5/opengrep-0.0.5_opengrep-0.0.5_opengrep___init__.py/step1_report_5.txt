  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function within a Python package, without clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, input functions, or possibly network sources if present (not visible in the provided snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data leaks to external servers, but none are explicitly identified in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input flows from source points (e.g., environment variables or input) to processing functions and potentially to output or network transmission functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are visible. The code does not contain obfuscated elements or unusual language features. No suspicious network activity or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, focusing on standard Python functionalities. It imports common modules, uses typical control flows, and does not include hidden or misleading variable names. There are no indications of malicious data handling or obfuscated code segments. Without external context or additional code segments, no signs of malicious activity or supply chain attacks are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no detectable signs of malware or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard utility or functional component with no security risks identified.",
