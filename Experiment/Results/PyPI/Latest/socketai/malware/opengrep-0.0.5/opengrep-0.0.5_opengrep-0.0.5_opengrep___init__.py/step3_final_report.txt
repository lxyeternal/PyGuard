{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, providing a detailed analysis of code sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, and overall security posture.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, network responses, or external data sources read by the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, code injection, or security vulnerabilities, such as system calls, network transmissions, or data storage.",
  "flows": "Paths from data sources to sinks, indicating how untrusted input propagates through the code potentially leading to vulnerabilities or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, unnecessary dynamic execution, or suspicious control flow that deviate from benign patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is either missing, empty, or minimal in all reports, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. When code is present, it appears benign, reading environment variables, user inputs, or network responses without suspicious patterns. Risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal or absent code and no malicious indicators. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious activity. Confidence levels are high where code exists and low where code is missing, appropriately reflecting the certainty of the analysis. The scores are conservative and justified based on the evidence, with no false positives or overlooked suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "All analyzed code snippets are benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scoring and assessments are consistent and appropriate given the limited or absent code content. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
