The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified given the minimal and safe nature of the code, though the actual behavior depends on the implementation of the entry point, which is outside this snippet."

There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or destructive actions. The behavior warrants caution due to privacy concerns but does not constitute malware. The assigned scores are appropriate: malware at 0.2, obfuscated at 0, and security risk at 0.4. No adjustments are necessary."
