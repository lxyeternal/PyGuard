  "purpose": "Defines package metadata and configuration for building and distributing the Python package 'opengrep'.",
  "sources": "Reads static package metadata, dependencies, and entry point definitions; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with standard structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, specifying package info, dependencies, and CLI entry point. No dynamic code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The entry point references 'opengrep.main:main', but without its implementation, no malicious behavior can be inferred. Dependencies are minimal and common. The code is static and well-structured, indicating benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified given the minimal and safe nature of the code, though the actual behavior depends on the implementation of the entry point, which is outside this snippet.",
