  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py for a Python package, with no suspicious or malicious code.\n- The code is static, uses common dependencies, and defines an entry point for a CLI tool.\n- No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or external data handling are present.\n- The main concern might be the CLI entry point, but without its implementation, there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Comments:** The securityRisk score is slightly above zero, perhaps reflecting minimal risk due to the CLI entry point, but without evidence, this seems conservative. The malware score is zero, which is appropriate.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Comments:** Very conservative and appropriate.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Same; no suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Comments:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Comments:** Slightly higher securityRisk score, but still reasonable given the context.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Same; no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Comments:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's content.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but all are low, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is a typical setup.py script with no suspicious or malicious constructs.\n- The only potential concern is the CLI entry point, but without its implementation, there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The securityRisk scores in some reports are slightly above zero, which is reasonable given the CLI interface, but still very low.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- I would maintain the malware=0 and obfuscated=0 across all reports.\n- The securityRisk scores could be uniformly set to 0, considering the lack of any suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0 (minimal risk, standard setup script)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.",
