  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'opengrep', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Definitions of variables, import statements, and package metadata fields such as name, version, author, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'setup()' function, which initiates package installation and configuration processes.",
  "flows": "Import of modules -> variable definitions -> setup() call with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data reads beyond standard setup parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports 'setuptools', defines package metadata and dependencies, and calls 'setup()' with these parameters. There are no signs of malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The dependencies are minimal and standard. The entry point executes a main function in the 'opengrep' package, which appears to be a normal CLI script. Overall, the code is typical for a package setup and contains no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a legitimate package configuration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
