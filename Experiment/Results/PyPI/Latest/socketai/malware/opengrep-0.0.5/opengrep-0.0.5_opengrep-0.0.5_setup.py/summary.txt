  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified given the minimal and safe nature of the code, though the actual behavior depends on the implementation of the entry point, which is outside this snippet."
