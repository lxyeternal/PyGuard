  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly clear from the provided snippet, but it appears to involve data processing or manipulation, possibly for network communication or data storage.",
  "sources": "Input data could come from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules; however, no explicit input sources are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or environment variable modifications, but no such operations are clearly visible.",
  "flows": "Without explicit data handling or I/O operations, there are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows in the current code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code appears straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Python with no signs of obfuscated patterns, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. No external network connections, data leaks, or unsafe operations are evident. The absence of input/output handling or secret data suggests no malicious activity. Since only a code fragment is provided, this analysis assumes normal functionality without hidden backdoors or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns or activities.",
