  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate code with suspicious traits such as obfuscation and dynamic execution, but no confirmed malicious payloads are present. The overall malware likelihood is moderate, with scores around 0.2–0.4. Obfuscation levels are high in several reports, justifying scores around 0.6. Security risk scores are moderate, reflecting potential for malicious activity but lacking concrete evidence. The assessments are generally consistent, with minor adjustments suggested for some reports to better align scores with observed traits."
