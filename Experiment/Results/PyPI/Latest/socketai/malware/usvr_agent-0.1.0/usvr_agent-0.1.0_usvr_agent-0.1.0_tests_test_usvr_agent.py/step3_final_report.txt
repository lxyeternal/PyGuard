  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns such as obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, and data leaks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, file reads, network requests, function parameters, API calls.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system writes, system commands, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing functions, potentially untrusted data reaching network/system interfaces, especially through eval/exec or dynamic imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), obfuscation, hardcoded credentials or URLs, dynamic imports, inconsistent obfuscation indicators, suspicious complexity, and dynamic code patterns without clear benign purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits multiple suspicious traits: high obfuscation levels, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, and complex control flows. Some reports note benign patterns with no suspicious activity, while others highlight potential malicious indicators. The presence of obfuscation and dynamic code points to moderate suspicion, but no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed. The inconsistency in obfuscation assessment (e.g., report 4's conflicting statements) is noted, but overall, the suspicion levels align with the described behaviors. The code's structure suggests potential for malicious extension or sabotage, warranting cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate code with suspicious traits such as obfuscation and dynamic execution, but no confirmed malicious payloads are present. The overall malware likelihood is moderate, with scores around 0.2–0.4. Obfuscation levels are high in several reports, justifying scores around 0.6. Security risk scores are moderate, reflecting potential for malicious activity but lacking concrete evidence. The assessments are generally consistent, with minor adjustments suggested for some reports to better align scores with observed traits.",
