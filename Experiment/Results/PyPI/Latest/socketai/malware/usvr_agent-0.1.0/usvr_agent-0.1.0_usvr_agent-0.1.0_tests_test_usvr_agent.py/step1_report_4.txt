  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some form of data processing, possibly related to network communication or file handling.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly visible in the provided code snippet; potential sources could include user input, environment variables, or external files if used.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets, file write operations, or system calls if present, but none are explicitly shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are identifiable from the code snippet provided; this limits the ability to trace data flow or injection points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are apparent. The code uses standard language features; no obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward, with typical Python constructs. There are no signs of malicious payloads, such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or malicious network activity. The absence of external calls, suspicious variable names, or unusual imports suggests benign intent. Due to limited code context, some assumptions are made, but nothing suspicious is detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign with no obfuscated or malicious elements. Confidence in this assessment is high given the clarity of the code, but limited context reduces absolute certainty.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
