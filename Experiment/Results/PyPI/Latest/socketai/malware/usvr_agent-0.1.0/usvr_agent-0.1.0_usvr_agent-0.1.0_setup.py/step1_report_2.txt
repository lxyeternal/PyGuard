{
  "purpose": "To create a Python package named 'usvr_agent' that prevents installation unless a specific check is bypassed.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads 'README.rst' during long_description assignment.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the code raises an exception to abort installation.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading package metadata and attempting to run setup, ultimately invoking the custom AbortInstall run method to terminate installation.",
  "anomalies": "The AbortInstall class intentionally aborts installation with a message referencing an 'evilpackage.fatezero.org' URL. The setup script uses an obfuscated or suspicious URL, which may indicate malicious intent. The code does not perform typical installation steps but instead blocks it deliberately, suggesting an attempt to prevent standard use.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that raises a SystemExit with a message directing to a suspicious URL, effectively blocking package installation. The setup configuration references a malicious-looking URL, possibly indicating an attempt at sabotage or misleading behavior. The rest of the script is standard for a setup.py, with no other malicious code or hidden backdoors. The primary anomaly is the intentional blocking of installation and the suspicious URL in package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is designed to prevent installation and directs users to a potentially malicious URL, which indicates malicious intent or sabotage. The package does not perform any malicious actions during runtime but intentionally blocks use, which could be considered malicious sabotage.",
