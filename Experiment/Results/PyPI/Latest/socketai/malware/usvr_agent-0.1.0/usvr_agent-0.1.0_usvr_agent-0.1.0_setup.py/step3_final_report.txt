{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script that intentionally prevents installation by raising a SystemExit with a warning message and referencing a suspicious URL, likely for sabotage or malicious deception.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.rst' file for the long description and imports modules; no untrusted input is processed.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have typical sinks like data exfiltration or code execution; the primary sink is the deliberate raising of SystemExit to abort installation.",
  "flows": "The flow involves the custom install command (`AbortInstall`) being invoked during installation, which then raises SystemExit, preventing further execution.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated references to the URL 'http://evilpackage.fatezero.org/' and the warning message, along with the deliberate abort, are suspicious anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py that defines a custom install command to abort installation with a warning. It does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscated code. The repeated URL and warning message suggest malicious sabotage or deception. The malware score is 0, as no malicious code executes. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear. The security risk score is high (~0.9) due to its malicious intent to sabotage installation and mislead users, which could be used in supply chain attacks or phishing scenarios. The behavior aligns with malicious sabotage rather than active malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not actively malicious but exhibits malicious intent through sabotage and misleading references. It should be considered high risk due to its potential to disrupt or deceive users, despite lacking active malware.",
