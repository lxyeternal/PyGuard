  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external files, dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, obscure variables.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file outputs, logs, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, user input, files) potentially leading to code execution or data leaks; dynamic code execution pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded paths/credentials, obscure variable names, unvalidated data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating potential malicious intent. The presence of hardcoded credentials and obscure variables further raises suspicion. The data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks suggests possible exploitation vectors. The lack of suspicious patterns in some reports aligns with benign code, but the signs in Report 1 justify a moderate concern. The scores reflect these observations, with higher malware and obfuscation scores in Report 1 and minimal risk in others.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate signs of obfuscation and potential malicious behavior, primarily in Report 1. Other reports are benign. The overall security risk is moderate, with a malware score indicating possible but unconfirmed malicious intent. Continuous monitoring and deeper static/dynamic analysis are recommended for the suspicious code.",
