  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some form of data processing, possibly involving external inputs.",
  "sources": "Input functions (such as input() or reading from files or network sockets), environment variables, external modules that fetch data",
  "sinks": "Potential data output functions (print(), logging, network transmission, file writing), or database access points",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment, external data) to sinks (output, storage, network transmission) through intermediate processing steps",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code obfuscation, or unusual logic detected; the code appears straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code reads input data and processes it through various functions. No signs of data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors are present. Usage of standard libraries without suspicious modifications suggests no malicious intent. No malicious or obfuscated code patterns identified. The code structure is clear and conventional, with no hidden or misleading constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign data processing script with standard practices. Confidence is high that this code is safe and not malicious.",
