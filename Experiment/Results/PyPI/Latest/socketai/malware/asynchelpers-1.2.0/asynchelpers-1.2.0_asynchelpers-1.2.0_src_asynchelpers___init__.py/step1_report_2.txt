  "purpose": "Initialize runtime environment asynchronously and expose utility functions and classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions, calls _refresh_runtime during startup, checks for existing event loop.",
  "sinks": "Calls _refresh_runtime(), interacts with asyncio event loop, potential scheduling of coroutines.",
  "flows": "Imports → _refresh_runtime() during startup → event loop management",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors observed. Use of asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe() is appropriate for existing loops.",
  "analysis": "The code performs asynchronous initialization by calling _refresh_runtime(), ensuring it runs correctly whether an event loop is running or not. It uses standard asyncio patterns to schedule this initialization. No malicious patterns, such as network data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are evident. The imports are standard and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The code appears to be a straightforward async setup routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard asynchronous initialization routine with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages runtime setup with proper asyncio handling.",
