{
  "purpose": "The code initializes runtime configuration asynchronously and exposes utility functions and classes for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (.core, .utils, ._config) and executes asynchronous initialization via _refresh_runtime().",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code primarily performs setup and exports.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling _refresh_runtime() during module import, scheduled on existing or new event loops, with no data from external sources directly processed.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs conditional logic to run asynchronous initialization depending on event loop state, which is standard practice; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules, defines an async initialization function, and schedules it to run upon import. It checks if an asyncio event loop is active; if not, it runs the coroutine with asyncio.run(). If an event loop is active (e.g., in a web server), it schedules the task thread-safe. No external data is read directly, no untrusted inputs processed, and no suspicious operations observed. The import statements are straightforward, and the initialization pattern is common for async setups. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The purpose appears to be safe runtime configuration initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign initialization routine that asynchronously refreshes runtime settings upon import. No malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks identified.",
