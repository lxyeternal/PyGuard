{
  "purpose": "Initialize runtime environment asynchronously during module import to ensure readiness of dependencies or configuration.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from local modules (.core, .utils, ._config) and calls _refresh_runtime(). It does not read external inputs directly.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform network/file I/O.",
  "flows": "The code flows from module import to the invocation of _refresh_runtime() via an async background task, depending on the event loop state.",
  "anomalies": "The code conditionally initializes asynchronous runtime in a way that adapts to existing event loops, which is standard practice. No unusual patterns or hardcoded secrets are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports local modules and defines an async function for background initialization, specifically calling _refresh_runtime(). It then checks if an event loop is running; if not, it uses asyncio.run() to execute the coroutine, otherwise, it schedules it on the existing loop with run_coroutine_threadsafe(). This pattern ensures asynchronous initialization without blocking or interfering with other asyncio tasks. No external input, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears to perform routine setup tasks safely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard asynchronous initialization pattern that sets up the runtime environment during module import. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are detected based on the provided fragment.",
