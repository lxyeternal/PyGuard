  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the original code provided.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard async HTTP client with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, securityRisk 0. Reasonable; no issues detected.\n- **Comments:** The report is accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same code, identical logic.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correctly states no malicious activity, just a standard utility.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0. Perfectly reasonable.\n- **Comments:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same code, similar reasoning.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correctly notes no malicious behavior, only potential data leakage if misused.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1. The securityRisk is slightly above zero due to the potential for misuse.\n- **Comments:** Slightly higher securityRisk score is justified given that the fetch method can retrieve untrusted content, which could be misused downstream, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same code.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Appropriately identifies the code as benign, standard, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1. Reasonable.\n- **Comments:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same code.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correctly describes the code as a legitimate helper with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Comments:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code confirmation:** All reports correctly identify the code as a standard async HTTP helper.\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which is appropriate; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to the potential for misuse (fetching untrusted URLs), which is reasonable.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a simple, legitimate utility class for asynchronous HTTP GET requests.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The slight security risk score of 0.1 is justified due to the potential for misuse if untrusted URLs are fetched.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to potential misuse, not actual malicious behavior)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring is reasonable.
