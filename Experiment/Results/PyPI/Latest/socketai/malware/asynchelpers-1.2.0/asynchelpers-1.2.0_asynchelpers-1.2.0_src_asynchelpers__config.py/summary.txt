  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious or supply chain attack vectors, including remote download, silent execution, lack of validation, and cleanup routines. These factors justify high malware and security risk scores. The pattern is consistent with malicious activity, especially if the remote URL is untrusted. The code should be flagged for review and possibly blocked in security-sensitive environments."
