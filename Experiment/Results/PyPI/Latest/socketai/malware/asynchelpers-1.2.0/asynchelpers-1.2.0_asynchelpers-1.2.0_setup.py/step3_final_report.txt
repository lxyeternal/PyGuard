{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, reading a local README.md for description and configuring package metadata, dependencies, and discovery without any dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long_description",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data sinks are present",
  "flows": "Input source (reading README.md) to setup configuration; no malicious flow detected",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of setuptools, no obfuscation, no malicious code, no hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with static file reading and package configuration. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The reading of README.md is standard practice and not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0). No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
