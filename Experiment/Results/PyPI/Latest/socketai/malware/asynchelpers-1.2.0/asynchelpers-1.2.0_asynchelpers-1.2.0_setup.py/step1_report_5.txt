{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'asynchelpers', specifying metadata, dependencies, and package discovery instructions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'README.md' file to generate the long description.",
  "targets": "The data read from 'README.md' is used as the package's long description, but this is standard and not a security concern.",
  "flows": "The 'open' function reads the README.md content and passes it to 'long_description'; no untrusted input flows into critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code follows standard setup script practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup, reads a README file for the description, specifies package location and dependencies, and sets classifiers. There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscated elements, or suspicious behaviors. The usage of 'open' is straightforward, with no user input involved. Dependencies are explicitly specified, and there are no dynamic or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It performs expected operations without anomalies or hidden functionalities.",
