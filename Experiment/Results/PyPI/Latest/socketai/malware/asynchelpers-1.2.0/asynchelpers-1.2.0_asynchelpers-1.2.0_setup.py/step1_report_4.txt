{
  "purpose": "The code is configuring the setup process for a Python package named 'asynchelpers', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description, importing modules 'setuptools' for setup functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external data processing beyond reading a file.",
  "flows": "The code reads a local file 'README.md' for long_description, which could be a source if the file is manipulated, but this is standard practice.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setup tools for packaging a Python project. It imports 'setuptools' functions, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery configuration. The reading of 'README.md' is typical for long_description. No external data sources, untrusted input handling, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices for Python package configuration.",
