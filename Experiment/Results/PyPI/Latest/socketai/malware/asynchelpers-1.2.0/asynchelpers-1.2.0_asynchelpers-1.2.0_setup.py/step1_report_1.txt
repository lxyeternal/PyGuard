  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'asynchelpers' Python library, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no network, file writing, or environment variable usage in this script.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks; the script only reads a file for metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected. Usage of standard setup tools and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions from setuptools, specifies package metadata, and reads a README file for description. It uses standard functions like find_packages to locate modules. No code injections, malicious network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The only notable operation is reading a local markdown file, which is typical for setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
