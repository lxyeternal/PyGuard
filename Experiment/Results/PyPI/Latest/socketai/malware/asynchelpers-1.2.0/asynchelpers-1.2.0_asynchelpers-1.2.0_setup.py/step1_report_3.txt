{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging the 'asynchelpers' Python project, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata (name, version, author info), the long description from 'README.md', and the dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, reading 'README.md' could be exploited if the file contains malicious content, but this is generally harmless. No other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static strings and file read ('README.md') into the setup configuration. No user input or untrusted sources are processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be standard setup configuration. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions from setuptools, specifies package metadata, reads a README file for the long description, and defines dependencies and classifiers. All operations are typical for a setup script. No indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. The use of open('README.md') is standard, with no evident malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, and there are no security risks associated with its contents.",
