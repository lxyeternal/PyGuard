  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface to execute various predefined scripts or functions related to server initialization, snapshot preview, help display, operator assignment, and server nuking.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments; dynamic import and execution of other scripts or functions based on command input.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external scripts via subprocess; import and call of functions from other modules; logging errors; printing messages.",
  "flows": "User supplies command -> execute_command_script interprets command -> either runs a script via subprocess or imports and calls functions directly, possibly with additional arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with dynamic script paths based on user input could potentially execute arbitrary scripts if command mapping is manipulated; import of specific functions from external modules without validation; no input validation for arguments passed to subprocess or imported functions.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly maps commands to specific script files or functions and executes them. The subprocess calls are based on static script names, reducing risk of arbitrary code execution, assuming command_map is not tampered. However, the code imports functions directly from external modules ('pojange_resorter.forceop' and 'pojange_resorter.nukeserver'), which could be risky if those modules are malicious or compromised. No sanitization or validation is performed on extra_args passed to these functions or scripts, which might lead to unintended behavior if external modules are malicious. The code handles errors by logging them, but no security measures or restrictions are in place to prevent misuse. The dynamic import of functions from external modules could potentially be exploited if those modules contain malicious code, but within this code fragment, no clear malicious behavior or backdoors are evident. The code appears to be an administrative tool designed to execute specific scripts or functions, with no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a command dispatcher executing specific scripts or functions based on user input. It does not exhibit malicious behavior directly but depends on the integrity of the external modules and scripts it calls. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. Security risks exist if external modules or scripts are compromised, but within this code snippet, no malicious intent is apparent.",
