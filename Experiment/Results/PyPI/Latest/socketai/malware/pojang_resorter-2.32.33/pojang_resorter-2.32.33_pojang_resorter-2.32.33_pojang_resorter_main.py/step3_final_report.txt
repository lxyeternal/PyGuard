{
  "purpose": "A command-line interface tool that maps user commands to scripts or functions for server management tasks, executing them via subprocess or direct imports.",
  "sources": "User input from command-line arguments, script files in the same directory, external modules 'pojange_resorter.forceop' and 'pojange_resorter.nukeserver'.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to run scripts, imported functions from external modules, logging errors.",
  "flows": "User command determines which script or function is invoked; subprocess runs scripts based on command map; imported functions are called with additional arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns. External modules are called directly without validation, which could be risky if compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a dispatcher for server management commands, using a static command map to execute scripts or functions. It imports specific functions from external modules and runs scripts via subprocess. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. Risks mainly stem from external module trustworthiness and lack of input validation for additional arguments. The command map limits arbitrary execution, reducing risk. The code structure is straightforward and secure under the assumption that external modules are trustworthy. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is moderate (~0.2), considering external dependencies and lack of input sanitization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign command dispatcher with controlled execution paths. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident. The primary concern is external module integrity and input validation. Overall, it presents a low to moderate security risk, manageable with proper external module management and input sanitization.",
