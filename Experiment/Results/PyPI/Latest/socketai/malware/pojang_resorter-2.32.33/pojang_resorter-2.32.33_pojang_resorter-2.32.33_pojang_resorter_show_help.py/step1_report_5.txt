{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface (CLI) with colored ASCII art and help information for managing server and user commands related to a Mojang interaction tool.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine user commands.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent over networks, stored insecurely, or used in a way that could leak information.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments flow from argparse input into the command parsing but do not reach any sensitive sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Uses colorama for colored terminal output, but no suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama for colored terminal output and defines a function to display ASCII art and help text with colored formatting. It sets up an argparse parser with subcommands for server and user management. There are no input/output data flows to external systems, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors or malicious code. All components are straightforward, and the purpose appears to be purely for CLI help display.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed solely for CLI help display with colored ASCII art and command descriptions. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident.",
