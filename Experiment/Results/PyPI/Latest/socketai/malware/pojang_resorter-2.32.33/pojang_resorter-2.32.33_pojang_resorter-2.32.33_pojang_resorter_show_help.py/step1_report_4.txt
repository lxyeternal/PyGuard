{
  "purpose": "Provides a CLI tool with help display and command options related to a Mojang interaction framework.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine user commands.",
  "sinks": "Prints ASCII art and command help text to stdout; no direct data leaks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line args) → argparse parsing → conditional display of help and ASCII art.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama, defines a function to show help with ASCII art and colored text, and displays help info based on command-line args. No external data inputs other than command-line arguments. No data sinks that leak information, nor any suspicious or malicious operations. The structure and behavior are straightforward and consistent with a CLI help utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign CLI help display with ASCII art and command options. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. It appears to be a normal, harmless utility script.",
