  "purpose": "Display ASCII art and command help messages for a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "argparse for command parsing, colorama for terminal coloring, static ASCII art and help strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static output only.",
  "flows": "User input triggers command parsing, which leads to static ASCII art and help display.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama, defines a function to display ASCII art and help messages with colored formatting, and parses command-line arguments to show help info. No network activity, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's purpose is purely aesthetic and informational. All signals point to benign, static code with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static CLI help utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: ~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. The overall security risk is negligible.",
