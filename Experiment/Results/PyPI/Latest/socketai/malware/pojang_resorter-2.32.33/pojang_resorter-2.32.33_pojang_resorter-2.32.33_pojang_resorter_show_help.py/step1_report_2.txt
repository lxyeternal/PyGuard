{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for a Python-Mojang interaction tool, displaying help with ASCII art and color formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments using argparse.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "User inputs command-line arguments → argparse processes commands → display ASCII art and help information.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Use of colorama appears purely for aesthetic purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a function show_help() that displays ASCII art and command descriptions. It uses argparse to parse commands such as initialize_server, preview_server, display_help, and assign_operator. The ASCII art is static and serves as visual enhancement. There are no data leaks, network calls, or obfuscated code. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious operations or anomalies observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI help utility that enhances visual presentation with ASCII art and colors. It does not contain malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security risks.",
