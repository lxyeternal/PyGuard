{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with a hypothetical Python-Mojang interaction tool, primarily displaying help information with ASCII art and colored text.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include command-line arguments processed by argparse, specifically the subcommands provided by the user.",
  "sinks": "The script outputs to the console via print statements. No direct sinks such as network, file, or system modification are evident in this code.",
  "flows": "User input via command-line arguments (source) determines the command displayed, but the code only displays help content; no data flows to external systems or modifies state beyond printing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code. The ASCII art and color handling are benign, and the command parsing is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored console output, then defines a show_help() function that displays ASCII art and command help information. The command definitions are static and do not process or execute any commands beyond printing help. There are no data leaks, no network connections, nor malicious behavior detected. The code appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a CLI help display with colored ASCII art. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
