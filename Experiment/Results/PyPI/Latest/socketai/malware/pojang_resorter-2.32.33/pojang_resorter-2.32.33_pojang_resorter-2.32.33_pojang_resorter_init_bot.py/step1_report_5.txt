{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated code that decompresses and executes a hidden payload, likely intended for malicious activity or concealment.",
  "sources": "Input data is embedded as a base64-encoded string within the lambda function, which is then reversed for deobfuscation.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executes the decompressed code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution and system compromise.",
  "flows": "The code reads embedded base64 data, reverses it, decompresses it with zlib, and then executes the resulting payload via exec(), forming a direct source-to-sink execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is heavily obfuscated using base64, string reversal, and zlib decompression. It contains a large, opaque base64 string that is likely malicious payload. Use of exec() on decompressed data is a strong indicator of malicious intent. No visible logging or validation of the payload.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a lambda function that decodes a base64 string, reverses it, and decompresses it with zlib. The resultant code is then executed with exec(). The base64 string is lengthy and appears random, typical of obfuscated malicious payloads. The use of reversing the string and dynamic decompression suggests an attempt to evade detection. The immediate execution of the decompressed payload via exec() is a high-risk pattern indicating malicious intent. No other benign behavior or legitimate functions are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious, strongly indicating malicious intent. It employs obfuscation techniques to hide its true payload, which is executed dynamically. The use of exec() on decompressed, reversed data is typical of malware designed to evade detection and execute arbitrary malicious code.",
