  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious due to its obfuscation and use of exec() on decoded data. The scores of malware=1, obfuscated=1, and securityRisk=1 are appropriate and justified given the pattern. Further payload analysis would be necessary for definitive confirmation, but current evidence warrants treating this as malicious."
