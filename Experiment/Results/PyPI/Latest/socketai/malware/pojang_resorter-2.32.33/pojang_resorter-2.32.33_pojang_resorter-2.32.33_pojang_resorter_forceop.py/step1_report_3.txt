{
  "purpose": "This script assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server via RCON.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password; the 'command' method from mcrcon library.",
  "sinks": "The 'mcr.command' function executing 'op {username}' on the server, which affects server privileges.",
  "flows": "User provides credentials and target username; the script connects to the server and executes the 'op' command with the provided username.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; uses dynamic input for sensitive data. No obfuscated code, no unusual code structures. Proper exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code securely takes input parameters for server connection and target username, then uses the 'mcrcon' library to send an 'op' command to the server. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized control. The script's purpose is straightforward and aligns with server management tasks. No suspicious anomalies or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate administrative utility for assigning operator privileges on a Minecraft server. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on user-provided input and standard library functions without suspicious activity.",
