  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, simple administrative tool for managing Minecraft server operator privileges. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the potential exposure of credentials via command line, but overall, the code is benign. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the analysis."
