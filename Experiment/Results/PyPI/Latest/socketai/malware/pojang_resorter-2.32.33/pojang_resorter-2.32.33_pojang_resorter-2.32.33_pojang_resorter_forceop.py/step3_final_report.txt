  "purpose": "Assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server via RCON.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments: username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'op {username}' command on the server; potential exposure of rcon_password in process list or shell history",
  "flows": "Inputs are taken from command-line arguments; connection established via MCRcon; command 'op {username}' sent to server",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets; no obfuscation; logs connection attempts and responses; no suspicious code structures",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that connects to a Minecraft server using provided credentials and issues an 'op' command to grant operator privileges. It does not contain malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The only minor security concern is passing the RCON password via command line, which could expose credentials in process listings or shell history, but this is a known trade-off and not malicious. The code logs connection attempts and responses, which is standard for such scripts. No vulnerabilities or malicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, simple administrative tool for managing Minecraft server operator privileges. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the potential exposure of credentials via command line, but overall, the code is benign. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
