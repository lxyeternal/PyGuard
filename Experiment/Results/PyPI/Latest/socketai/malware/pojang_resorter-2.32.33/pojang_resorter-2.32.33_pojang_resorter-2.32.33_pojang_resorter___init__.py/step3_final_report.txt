  "sources": "Import from local module '.main', setting __version__ and __author__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no network calls, no data leaks, no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Import statement from local module; setting metadata variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__ file that defines package metadata and imports a local main function. It contains no input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence, and assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and standard structure support this conclusion, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package initialization code with no security issues or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
