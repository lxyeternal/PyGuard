  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a minimal __init__ file for a package.\n- It defines `__version__` and `__author__`.\n- It imports `main` from a local module `.main`.\n- There are no data flows, no input/output, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  The code snippet does not contain any security issues, malware, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:**  \n  No errors or logical flaws are evident. All reports are consistent in describing the code as simple package metadata and import statements.\n\n- **Scores evaluation:**  \n  - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n  - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n  - **SecurityRisk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code.\n\n- **Risk score justification:**  \n  Since all scores are 0, there is no need to adjust. The code does not perform any risky or malicious actions.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  All reports correctly avoid speculative claims; they only describe the code's functionality.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code and each report's analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n**The code is a standard package initialization module with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation.**  \n**The provided reports are accurate and appropriately scored.**  \n**No changes are necessary.**\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n| -------- | ------------ | ----- |\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0** |\n\n**This reflects the benign nature of the code.**",
