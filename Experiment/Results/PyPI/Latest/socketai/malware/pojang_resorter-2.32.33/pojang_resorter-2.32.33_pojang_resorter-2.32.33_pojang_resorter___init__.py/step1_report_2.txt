  "purpose": "Defines metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The module imports the 'main' function from the local 'main' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling occurs; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are apparent within this snippet; only an import statement and metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports a main function from a local module. There are no data input/output operations, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious code patterns. As this is a minimal metadata and import snippet, it does not contain any malicious or security-risk elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to set package metadata and import a core function. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
