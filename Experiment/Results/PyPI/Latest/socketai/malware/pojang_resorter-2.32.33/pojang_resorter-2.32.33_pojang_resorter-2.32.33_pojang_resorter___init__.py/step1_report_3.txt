{
  "purpose": "Provides the core module for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, primarily importing the main function and setting metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main import main; module-level string assignments (__version__, __author__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling, no user input, no untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input or external data sources; static metadata assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward module definition with no dynamic code, obfuscated parts, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only includes a module-level docstring, import statement, and static metadata variables. It does not execute any untrusted code or handle external data. The import is relative, which is standard in package modules, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. No potential security risks or malware behaviors are evident based on this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module initializer for a CLI package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this snippet.",
