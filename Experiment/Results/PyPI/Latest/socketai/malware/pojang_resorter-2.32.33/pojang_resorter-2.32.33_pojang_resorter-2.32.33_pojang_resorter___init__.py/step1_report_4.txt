  "purpose": "Provides basic package metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports 'main' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could leak data or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is primarily metadata and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only package metadata definitions and an import statement. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The import is from a local module, which is standard practice. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, serving only to define package metadata and import a main function. There is no malicious behavior or security risk evident in this snippet.",
