{
  "purpose": "Decode and execute base64-encoded, zlib-compressed payload, likely intended to run malicious code.",
  "sources": "Input data is the large base64-encoded string assigned to the variable in the exec statement.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decompressed data via exec(), which could run malicious code once decoded.",
  "flows": "The code reverses the string, base64-decodes it, decompresses it with zlib, and then executes the result.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated decoding chain: reversing string, base64 decoding, decompressing; use of lambda function for dynamic import; direct exec of potentially malicious payload.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda that imports zlib and base64 modules dynamically. It reverses a long string, base64-decodes it, then decompresses it with zlib, and finally executes the decompressed code with exec(). The payload is highly obfuscated and appears designed to conceal malicious intent. The use of string reversal, base64, and zlib compression is typical for hiding malicious scripts. The exec() call is a major security risk, allowing arbitrary code execution. There are no indications of benign functionality; all signs point toward malicious obfuscation and intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to conceal and execute potentially malicious payload through multiple layers of obfuscation. It is highly suspicious and likely intended to run malicious code without detection.",
