  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for sending data, including SSL handling and data preparation methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules, class initializations, and method parameters such as zip_name, data (BytesIO), and preview.",
  "sinks": "SSL context modification in _create_unverified_https() potentially affects secure communication; data passed to __send_archive() could be sent over network.",
  "flows": "The method _create_unverified_https() disables SSL verification, which may be invoked before sending data, but actual data flow depends on subclass implementations.",
  "anomalies": "Disabling SSL verification globally can be risky; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code is present. Use of abstract methods indicates this is a template, not functional code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with methods to get data, send data, and modify SSL behavior. The _create_unverified_https() method disables SSL verification, which is potentially dangerous if invoked, but by itself, does not perform malicious activity. No data leaks, credential handling, or malicious logic are evident. The code is a template for subclasses to implement data sending, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard abstract class template for data transmission, with a method to disable SSL verification. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent in the provided code. The disabling of SSL verification can be risky but is not inherently malicious.",
