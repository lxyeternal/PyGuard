  "conclusion": "The script is not malicious by itself but has a high potential for malicious misuse. It enables downloading and executing arbitrary files silently, which can be exploited for malicious purposes. The malware score should be around 0.7, reflecting this potential, while obfuscation remains 0. due to its straightforward nature. The security risk is high (~0.75-0.8), given the capabilities and risks associated with silent execution and lack of validation."
