  "purpose": "This setup.py script defines the package metadata, dependencies, and optional platform-specific requirements for the 'systoring' Python library, intended for system monitoring and educational purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata and dependency declarations within setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Unusual phrase 'ONLY!!!' in description, but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static setup script for a Python package. It reads a local README file and calls setup() with fixed parameters, dependencies, and optional platform-specific requirements. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. Dependencies are common for system monitoring tools. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores accurately reflect its safe and straightforward nature.",
