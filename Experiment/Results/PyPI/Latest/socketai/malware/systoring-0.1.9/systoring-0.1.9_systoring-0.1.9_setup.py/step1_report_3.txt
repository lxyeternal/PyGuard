  "purpose": "This script is intended to set up a Python package named 'systoring', including its metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining package metadata and dependencies in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or user inputs are processed in a way that could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script only reads a file and defines setup parameters; there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; all functions are standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations: reading a markdown file, defining package metadata, dependencies, and conditional requirements for different OS. No code execution, dynamic code, or network operations are present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
