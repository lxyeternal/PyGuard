  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'systoring' Python package, intended for monitoring system events, primarily for educational use.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing observed; no data leak or effect points identified.",
  "flows": "Input from README.md to long_description variable; data used in package metadata for distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. The package dependencies are standard for system monitoring libraries.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' functions, reads a markdown file for description, and configures package metadata including dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling. Dependencies are common for system monitoring tools and are appropriately version-restricted. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code appears to be a standard package setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
