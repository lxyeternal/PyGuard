{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'systoring', including package metadata, dependencies, and optional platform-specific requirements.",
  "sources": "The source of data is the 'README.md' file read for long description and the setup parameters that specify dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present that process untrusted input; the code is only for package setup configuration.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading a local file ('README.md') for description and passing static parameters to 'setup()'. There are no flows involving untrusted data or runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools', reads the 'README.md' for documentation, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and optional platform-specific dependencies. All components are static and standard for Python package configuration. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies.",
