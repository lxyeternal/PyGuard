  "purpose": "Platform-dependent import of system monitoring modules for cross-platform compatibility.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call to determine OS; import statements for monitoring modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; standard imports and OS detection.",
  "flows": "platform.system() determines OS -> conditional import of WindowsMonitoring -> module initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward platform check and imports, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple OS check using platform.system() and conditionally imports WindowsMonitoring if on Windows. It unconditionally imports MacMonitoring, initialize_system_monitoring, and InputMonitor, then exposes these via __all__. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The pattern is standard for cross-platform modules. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network activity are evident. The code is clear, readable, and aligns with best practices for platform-specific imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for platform-dependent module loading. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
