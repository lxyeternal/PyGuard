{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports specific classes or functions from relative submodules and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "The code reads the names of local modules (.ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb) for import statements and the __all__ list declaration.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code, as it does not process untrusted input or perform data manipulation.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The import statements are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports classes or functions from local submodules and sets the __all__ list for exports. It contains no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for Python module organization, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
