  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes from relative modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; just imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing classes from sibling modules and exposing them in __all__. No external data input, network calls, or sensitive operations are present. The structure indicates a standard module export pattern. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module re-export pattern with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
