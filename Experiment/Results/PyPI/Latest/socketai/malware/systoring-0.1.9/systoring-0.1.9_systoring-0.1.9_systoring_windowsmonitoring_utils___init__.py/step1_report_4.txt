{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to define and export specific classes or modules from the current package, facilitating organized access to components like ASt, Mssg, Lfr, Prtt, and Grb.",
  "sources": "The code reads from relative module imports (.ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb) and the __all__ list declaration.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed, stored, or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to defining the __all__ list for exports; no data flow from external sources or to external sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and minimal, with no hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual constructs. No obfuscated or malicious-looking code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module imports and export declarations. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or network communications. Its simplicity and standard pattern indicate typical package setup code. No indicators of malicious behavior or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export pattern with no malicious or security concerns detected. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
