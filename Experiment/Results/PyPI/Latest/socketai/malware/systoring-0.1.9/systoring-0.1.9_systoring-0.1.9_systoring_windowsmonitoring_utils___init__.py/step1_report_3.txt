{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes from local modules and defines an export list, likely part of a package's __init__.py to make classes available for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-critical actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable as no data processing or untrusted data handling is shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present in these import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports classes from sibling modules and defines __all__ for module exports. There are no data inputs, outputs, or data flows to analyze. It appears to be standard package initialization code. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or malicious logic are evident. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization snippet for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
