  "purpose": "Initialize platform-specific system and input monitoring threads based on the detected OS.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call to determine OS; import statements for monitoring classes; threading.Thread targets for start_monitoring and run methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected; monitoring functions may collect system/input data but no evidence of malicious data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> conditional branch -> threading.Thread(target=monitoring_method).start() for each platform.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the OS using platform.system(), then starts input monitoring and platform-specific system monitoring threads. It imports monitoring classes from external modules, which are assumed legitimate. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present. The threading usage is standard for concurrent monitoring. External modules' trustworthiness is a concern but cannot be assessed from this snippet. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate system monitoring purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a clear, standard implementation for platform-specific system and input monitoring. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores are consistent with a benign assessment, assuming external modules are trustworthy.",
