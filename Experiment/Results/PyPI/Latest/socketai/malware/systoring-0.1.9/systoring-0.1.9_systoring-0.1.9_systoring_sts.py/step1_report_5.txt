  "purpose": "Initialize platform-specific system monitoring and input monitoring threads based on the operating system.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for OS detection, InputMonitor().start_monitoring for input data, and possibly MacMonitoring().run or WindowsMonitoring().run for system monitoring.",
  "sinks": "Threads executing monitoring functions that could potentially collect sensitive data such as user input or system information.",
  "flows": "platform.system() reads OS info -> creates InputMonitor thread -> starts input monitoring -> depending on OS, creates and starts system monitor thread (MacMonitor or WindowsMonitor).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. The code simply initializes and starts monitoring threads based on OS detection.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it detects the OS, starts an input monitoring thread, and conditionally starts system monitoring threads for macOS or Windows. All functions invoked appear to be for monitoring purposes. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations. The monitoring functions themselves are imported from presumably legitimate modules, but without their implementation, we cannot confirm their safety. The code does not contain suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code initializes platform-specific monitoring threads, likely for system auditing or monitoring purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this fragment. The overall structure appears legitimate; however, the safety depends on the implementation of imported monitoring modules.",
