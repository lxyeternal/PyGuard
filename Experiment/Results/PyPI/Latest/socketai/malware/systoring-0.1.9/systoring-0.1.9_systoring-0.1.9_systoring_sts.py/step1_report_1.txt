  "purpose": "Initialize and run platform-specific system monitoring threads for macOS and Windows.",
  "sources": "platform.system() to determine OS, import statements for monitoring classes, threading.Thread to run monitoring functions.",
  "sinks": "Starting threads that execute monitoring functions (MacMonitor().run, WindowsMonitor().run).",
  "flows": "platform.system() read → conditional branch → thread target functions → thread start.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no data exfiltration, and no obfuscated code. The code simply starts monitoring threads based on OS detection.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system and starts monitoring threads accordingly. It imports monitoring classes from the systoring package and executes their run methods in separate threads. There are no signs of malicious actions such as data theft, network communication with suspicious domains, or backdoors. The thread functions seem to be intended for system monitoring. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The import of monitoring modules suggests intended functionality for system oversight, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs platform-specific system monitoring initialization in a straightforward manner without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be legitimate monitoring setup code. No security risks identified.",
