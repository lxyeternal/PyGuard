  "purpose": "Initialize system monitoring by starting platform-specific monitoring threads for macOS and Windows, along with input monitoring.",
  "sources": "Imports from systoring modules, platform.system() call, threading.Thread targeting start_monitoring and run methods.",
  "sinks": "Threads executing monitoring functions, which could potentially access or log sensitive system data.",
  "flows": "platform.system() output determines which monitoring thread is started; threads execute monitoring functions that may collect system info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of platform-specific imports; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports monitoring modules and starts threads for platform-specific system monitoring and input monitoring. It dynamically selects the appropriate monitoring based on OS, which is a typical pattern for system management tools. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no evident malicious activity. The modules imported are part of an external 'systoring' library; assuming they are legitimate, this appears to be normal system monitoring setup. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms apparent in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a platform-specific system and input monitoring initiator, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a benign system management script assuming the imported modules are legitimate.",
