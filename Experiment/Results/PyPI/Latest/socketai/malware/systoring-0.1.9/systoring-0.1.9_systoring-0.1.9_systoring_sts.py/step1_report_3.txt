  "purpose": "Initialize and start platform-specific monitoring threads for macOS or Windows systems.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call to determine OS, instantiation of MacMonitoring, WindowsMonitoring, and InputMonitor classes.",
  "targets": "Methods start_monitoring() for InputMonitor, run() for MacMonitor and WindowsMonitor, potentially executing code with side effects.",
  "flows": "platform.system() value influences which monitoring thread is started; input monitoring thread is always started; system-specific monitoring thread is started based on OS detection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected. Use of threading for monitoring is typical and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system monitoring classes for macOS and Windows, determines the OS, and starts input monitoring and system monitoring threads accordingly. The use of threading for starting monitoring functions appears standard. No signs of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. The code is straightforward and designed for monitoring purposes, aligning with legitimate system diagnostics rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate system monitoring setup for different platforms, with no indications of malicious behavior or malware. It simply starts input and system monitoring threads based on the OS, with no suspicious or malicious activities detected.",
