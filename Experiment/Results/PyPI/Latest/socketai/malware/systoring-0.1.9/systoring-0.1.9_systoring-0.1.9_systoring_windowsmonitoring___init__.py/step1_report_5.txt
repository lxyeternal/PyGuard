{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an __init__.py module that imports specific classes and enums for exposing a package's API.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no code that processes untrusted data or performs sensitive actions",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to critical functions; simply re-exports selected symbols",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements; standard package structure",
  "analysis": "The code strictly imports classes and enums from sibling modules and defines __all__ for export. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations present. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code follows a typical package initialization pattern, indicating intent to organize code cleanly without hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard __init__.py file for organizing package exports with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
