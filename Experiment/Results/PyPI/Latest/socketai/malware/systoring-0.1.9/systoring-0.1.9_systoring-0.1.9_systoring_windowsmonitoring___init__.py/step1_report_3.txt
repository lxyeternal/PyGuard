{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package module that imports specific classes and enums for use in the package, likely related to system monitoring and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or data output points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; just module imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. It only performs imports and defines __all__.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, serving to re-export components for public API. It imports classes and enums from internal modules and defines the public interface with __all__. No user input handling, network calls, or data processing present. No signs of malicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for exporting components and does not contain malicious behavior or security issues. It is a typical, benign part of a larger package.",
