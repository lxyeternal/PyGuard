{
  "purpose": "This code is for importing modules and defining public API exports for a larger Python package, likely related to system monitoring or utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or user input handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only module imports and export definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enums from local modules and defines the __all__ list for export control. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or other suspicious behavior. The structure is typical for Python package __init__.py files, indicating module organization. No malicious intent or anomalous behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports components and declares exports, with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
