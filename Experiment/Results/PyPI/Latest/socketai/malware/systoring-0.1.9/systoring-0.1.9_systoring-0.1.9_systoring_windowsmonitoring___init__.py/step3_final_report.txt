  "purpose": "Module initialization and symbol export for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils).",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external communication.",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ declaration; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export setup with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file that imports specific classes and functions from local modules and defines __all__ for symbol exports. It contains no network activity, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden code are present. The import statements are standard, and the code structure is typical for package initialization. Given the simplicity and clarity, there are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified based on the code content.",
