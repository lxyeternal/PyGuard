{
  "purpose": "This code defines an import interface for a Python package related to system monitoring and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and specific classes or functions from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only establishes module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be straightforward module import and export declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration to specify public API components. There are no data processing, input handling, or network operations. It appears to serve as an interface for other modules. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation, is evident. The code is minimal, clean, and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any malware or obfuscated code, and the security risk level is negligible.",
