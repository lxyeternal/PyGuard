  "purpose": "The code is intended to define a module that exports the AbstractSender class from the sender module.",
  "sources": "The code imports the AbstractSender class from a relative module named sender.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or output data; the code only imports and exports a class.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing AbstractSender from sender and making it available for external use.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, with no anomalies, unusual code, or hardcoded secrets; it appears to be a straightforward module definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class and declares the export list. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or other actions that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign module that only exports a class without any malicious intent or security issues.",
