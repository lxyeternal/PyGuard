  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal, straightforward, and only involves importing a class (`AbstractSender`) from a local module (`sender`) and exposing it via `__all__`.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, network activity, or other potentially malicious behavior is present.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate for module interface definition, with no anomalies or security issues.\n\n**Confirmation of Issues:**\n- The code matches the description in all reports; no issues are present in the code itself.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n**Scores Review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0\n- These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n**Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n- Since the code only imports and exports a class without any suspicious behavior, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n- Malware score of 0 is appropriate; there's no indication of malicious intent or activity.\n- The code does not perform any data handling, network communication, or dynamic execution that could pose security risks.\n\n**Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as boilerplate interface setup.\n- No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n**Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a simple, benign module definition. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the actual security posture of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard Python module exporting a class.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The current scoring is appropriate and should remain as is.",
