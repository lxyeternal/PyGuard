  "purpose": "Define an __all__ list for module exports, indicating that AbstractSender is intended to be publicly accessible.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .sender import AbstractSender'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports and defines export variables.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class named AbstractSender from a local module named sender and declares it as part of the public API via __all__. No data inputs, no external network interactions, and no logic that could be malicious. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
