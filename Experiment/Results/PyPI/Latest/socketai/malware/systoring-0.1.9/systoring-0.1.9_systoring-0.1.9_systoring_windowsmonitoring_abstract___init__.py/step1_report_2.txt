{
  "purpose": "Define and export an abstract sender class for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .sender import AbstractSender reads from a local module file named sender.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or output any data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only imports and exports a class name.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, contains no sensitive information, no hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named AbstractSender from a local module, then exposes it in the module's __all__ list. It is a standard practice for defining an interface or abstract class in Python modules. There are no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The simplicity and lack of dynamic code, user input, or network operations suggest a benign structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module definition that exports an abstract sender class. There are no malicious behaviors or security issues present.",
