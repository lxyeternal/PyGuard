  "purpose": "Minimal module that imports AbstractSender from a local sender module and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .sender module",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Absence of data flows, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs; code is straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and declares it in __all__, serving as a module interface. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution is present. The code is standard boilerplate with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module export pattern with no security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
