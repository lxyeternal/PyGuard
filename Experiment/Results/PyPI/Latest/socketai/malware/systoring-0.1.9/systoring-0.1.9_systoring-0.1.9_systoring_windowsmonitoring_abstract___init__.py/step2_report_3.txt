  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n```python\nfrom .sender import AbstractSender\n\n__all__ = [\"AbstractSender\"]\n```\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is minimal, importing a class from a local module and exposing it via `__all__`.\n- There are no data flows, no dynamic code execution, no user input, no network activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious constructs.\n- The class `AbstractSender` is presumably an abstract class or interface, but its implementation isn't provided here.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward module setup for a package.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**1-5 (All Reports):**\n- They uniformly describe the code as a simple, benign module declaration.\n- No anomalies, no suspicious behavior, no data flows, no external interactions.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n- The reasoning is consistent: the code is minimal and standard.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code matches the description: simple import and export with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate given the code snippet.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware: 0 across all reports. Correct, as there's no malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated: 0. Correct, code is clear.\n  - Security risk: 0. Correct, no vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions?**  \n  The reports assume the class `AbstractSender` is benign, but since its implementation isn't shown, we can't fully verify its safety. However, based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  No. All reports agree and are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain **0**. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain **0**. Code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0**. No security issues or vulnerabilities evident.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nSince the code is purely structural, serving as an interface or abstract class export, it doesn't pose any security threat. The reports correctly identify this.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Recommendation |\n|------------------|----------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                    |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                    |\n| Security Risk    | 0                    |\n\n**The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes needed.**",
