{
  "purpose": "Defines an import and exports a class name for module public API, likely part of a package's interface definition.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing AbstractSender from a relative module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only imports and declares exports",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious code or unusual constructs; simple import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class 'AbstractSender' from a relative module and declares it as part of the module's public API. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a typical module setup for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, serving as an interface declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard boilerplate code for a Python module.",
