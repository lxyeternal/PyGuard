{
  "purpose": "This code defines an interface or abstract class 'AbstractSender' for use in a larger Python project, likely related to sending data or messages.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'AbstractSender' from a local module '.sender'. No input or data reading occurs within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink operations such as data output, network transmission, or storage in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, with no suspicious variables, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs. The import and __all__ declaration are standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class and defines the module's export list. No execution logic, data handling, or potential security issues are present. Since the imported class is not shown, its behavior cannot be assessed here. The code structure is standard and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module declaration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a standard Python pattern for defining module exports.",
