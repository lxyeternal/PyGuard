  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project with setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, and README.md file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data read during setup; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open(\"README.md\") without exception handling, but this is typical in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package. It imports setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and reads the README file for a long description. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The only minor concern is the lack of exception handling when opening README.md, but this is standard practice and not indicative of malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is minimal (around 0 or 0.1), justified by the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and standard pattern of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
