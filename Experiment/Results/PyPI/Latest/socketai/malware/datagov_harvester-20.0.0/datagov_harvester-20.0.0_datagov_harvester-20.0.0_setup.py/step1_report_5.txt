  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'datagov-harvester' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the long_description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; setup configuration does not perform data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' content -> Package setup process; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md').read() without explicit error handling; potential issue if file is missing, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, utilizing setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. The only notable action is reading a README file for the long description, which is common practice. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present. The dependencies and metadata appear legitimate and aligned with typical package configuration. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard configuration file for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious code, and there are no security risks identified based on the provided code.",
