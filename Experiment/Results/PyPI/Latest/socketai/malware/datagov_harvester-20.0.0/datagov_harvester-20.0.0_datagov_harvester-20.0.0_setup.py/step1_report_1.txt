{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'datagov-harvester' Python project.",
  "sources": "User input in 'long_description' via open(\"README.md\").",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as no untrusted data is processed or sent outside the package setup context.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' file during setup to populate 'long_description'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open(\"README.md\") without exception handling could be risky if the file is missing, but this is standard practice and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' configuration for packaging a Python project with setuptools. It reads metadata, dependencies, and description info. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors, backdoors, or sabotage present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. The only potential concern is the file open for 'long_description' without error handling, but this is typical in setup scripts and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior and follows standard practices.",
