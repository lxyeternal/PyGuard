{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'datagov-harvester', intended to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and a README file (via open('README.md').read()) to provide long description.",
  "sinks": "The open() call reading 'README.md' could potentially be a source of untrusted data if the file contents are malicious, but this is a static file read, not user input.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading static content from 'README.md' during setup, which is then passed as long_description; no untrusted data or user input is involved in runtime.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns. The use of open() to read a static markdown file is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to configure package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. The only dynamic operation is reading the README.md file for description, which is a common pattern. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The package dependencies are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
