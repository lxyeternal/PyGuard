  "flows": "System info and network data collected from sources are compiled into a dictionary and sent via HTTP POST request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends potentially sensitive system and network information to an external URL without any user consent or control. The webhook URL is hardcoded as a suspicious test URL (https://webhook.site/gsa). No authentication or encryption is evident. The class initiates data collection immediately upon instantiation, which could be used for clandestine data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, IP addresses, domain names, system details, and a UUID for identification. It then posts this data to an external URL. All data collection methods are standard Python functions with no obfuscation or suspicious logic. However, the immediate automatic data exfiltration upon object creation, especially to a hardcoded URL, indicates potentially malicious intent. The URL used is a public testing service, which might be benign for testing but could also be exploited maliciously. No credentials, reverse shells, or system modifications are present. The overall design resembles a system info logger with the ability to exfiltrate data.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily functions as a system information collector and exfiltrator. It does not contain obvious malware such as backdoors, keyloggers, or destructive actions. However, its behavior of automatically sending sensitive data to an external endpoint, especially without user consent, raises security concerns. The use of a public webhook URL suggests potential malicious or testing intent. Overall, it is not outright malicious but could be used maliciously depending on context.",
