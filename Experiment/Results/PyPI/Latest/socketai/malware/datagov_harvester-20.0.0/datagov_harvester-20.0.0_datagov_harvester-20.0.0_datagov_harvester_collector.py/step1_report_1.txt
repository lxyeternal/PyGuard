{
  "purpose": "Collects system and network information and sends it to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, network interfaces, IP addresses, domain names, UUIDs, and system platform details.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST request to the specified webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System information and network data are gathered from system calls and socket functions, then sent directly over HTTP POST to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded webhook URL; collects detailed network info and hostname data; no explicit user input or environment variable checks. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code collects extensive system and network information, including hostname, IP addresses, domain names, and platform details. It uses socket functions for network data, platform and uuid modules for system identifiers, and requests for data exfiltration. The data collection is automated upon instantiation of the class, which may be unintended. The hardcoded webhook URL could be used maliciously for data exfiltration. No malicious or backdoor code, code injection, or obfuscation detected. The code does not perform harmful actions on the system itself but acts as an information stealer, transmitting data to an external URL, which could be suspicious if used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed for system information gathering and exfiltration via a webhook, which can be malicious if used without user consent. It does not contain code injection, backdoors, or malware but acts as a data collector. The hardcoded webhook URL and data exfiltration behavior are points of concern, though no direct malicious payloads are present.",
