  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward system info collector with exfiltration capability, lacking malicious payloads or obfuscation. While it poses privacy risks and could be misused, it does not contain malware. The scores should be adjusted to reflect the absence of malicious code, with a low malware score (~0) and a moderate security risk (~0.3) due to privacy implications."
