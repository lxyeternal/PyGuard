{
  "purpose": "Collect system and network information (host details, IPs, domains) and send it to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname via socket.gethostname(), retrieving IP addresses via socket.gethostbyname() and socket.getaddrinfo(), accessing the current file's directory path via Path(__file__).parent, and generating a UUID with uuid.uuid4().",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data via an HTTP POST request to the specified webhook URL using requests.post().",
  "flows": "System information is gathered from hostname, IP address resolution, and directory path, then packaged into a JSON payload and sent to the webhook URL via requests.post().",
  "anomalies": "Use of socket for hostname and IP resolution, which can reveal network configuration. The code gathers reverse DNS info, which could be used to identify network infrastructure. The webhook URL is hardcoded but does not appear malicious. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. No data exfiltration beyond system info. The code runs immediately upon class instantiation, which is potentially suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to collect system and network information, including hostname, IP addresses, domain names, and installation path, then send this data to an external URL via HTTP POST. It uses standard libraries and makes network calls to resolve hostnames and IPs, and generates a UUID for identification. There are no indications of malicious intent such as backdoors, data theft, or malicious network communication beyond standard data collection. The immediate execution in the constructor could be a concern but is not malicious in itself. The webhook URL is external but not suspicious or malicious by itself. Overall, the code appears to be for system inventory or monitoring rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system and network information collection and reports it externally. No malicious or harmful behavior is evident; the functions used are standard, and there are no signs of backdoors or malicious exfiltration. The potential concern is the automatic data collection and external communication, which could be misused, but on its own, it does not indicate malware. Security risks are low.",
