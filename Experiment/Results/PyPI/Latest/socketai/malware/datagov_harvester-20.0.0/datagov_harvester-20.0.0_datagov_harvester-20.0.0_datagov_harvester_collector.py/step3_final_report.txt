  "purpose": "Collects system hostname, platform details, network information, UUID, installation path, and timestamp, then exfiltrates this data via a POST request to a specified webhook URL.",

  "sinks": "requests.post() to external webhook URL with JSON payload",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system and network sources, assembled into a dictionary, then sent directly via HTTP POST to the webhook URL upon class instantiation",
  "anomalies": "Immediate data exfiltration without user consent; use of a hardcoded, placeholder webhook URL; no obfuscation or malicious payloads detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs system and network information collection using standard libraries, then sends this data immediately to an external URL. No malicious code, obfuscation, or code injection is present. The data exfiltration pattern is suspicious but not inherently malicious; it could be misused for tracking or reconnaissance. The webhook URL is a placeholder, reducing suspicion of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.2, risk ~0.3-0.5) are conservative but acceptable given the behavior. The code's primary concern is privacy invasion rather than malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward system info collector with exfiltration capability, lacking malicious payloads or obfuscation. While it poses privacy risks and could be misused, it does not contain malware. The scores should be adjusted to reflect the absence of malicious code, with a low malware score (~0) and a moderate security risk (~0.3) due to privacy implications.",
