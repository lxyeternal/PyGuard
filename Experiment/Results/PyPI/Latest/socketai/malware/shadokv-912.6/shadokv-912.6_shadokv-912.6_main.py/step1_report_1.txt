  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, possibly for tracking or surveillance purposes.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "targets": "Constructed URLs with system info and random number, which are fetched via urllib.request.urlopen()",
  "flows": "Data collected from system sources flows into URL parameters, then sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external domains with non-standard TLDs (.cn, .fun). The code sends system info without user consent. The URLs are obfuscated and appear designed for data exfiltration. Random number generation used as a parameter to possibly correlate or track requests.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current directory, and generates a random number. It constructs URLs with these parameters and attempts to send requests to external domains. The domains are suspicious and may be malicious. The code does not handle responses beyond logging, nor does it provide any user interaction or obvious legitimate purpose. The pattern suggests covert data transmission, possibly tracking or surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears designed to covertly collect system information and transmit it to external servers, indicating malicious intent. The presence of suspicious domains and the silent data exfiltration behavior raise security concerns. The overall purpose seems to be unauthorized data collection or monitoring.",
