  "flows": "Collects hostname, username, current directory, generates a random number, then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "Sends potentially sensitive system info (hostname, username, current directory) to external servers without user consent. Uses multiple suspicious domains (oast-*). No validation or user prompts. No clear legitimate purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, and current working directory. It generates a random number and constructs URLs to external domains, sending collected data via HTTP GET requests. The domains used appear suspicious and could be part of a malicious setup for data exfiltration or tracking. No encryption or authentication is used, and no user consent or safeguards are present. The purpose seems to be to report or exfiltrate environment details silently.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by transmitting system information to untrusted external domains without user knowledge. The use of multiple suspicious URLs and silent data sending indicates potential malicious intent or tracking, although it does not perform direct harmful actions like damaging files or stealing credentials. It should be treated with suspicion.",
