  "flows": "Collected system info (hostname, username, current directory, random number) is URL-encoded and sent to each URL in the list via HTTP GET requests",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with obfuscated domain names; sending system information without user consent; potential data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, current working directory, and a random number. It constructs URLs with these parameters and makes HTTP GET requests to each specified URL. The URLs appear to be obfuscated or suspicious, possibly for exfiltrating environment info. The code does not perform any malicious actions directly like modifying files, executing commands, or establishing reverse shells. It does, however, silently transmit system info to potentially malicious domains, indicating a privacy or security concern. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present; the code is straightforward but potentially malicious due to data exfiltration intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect and send system information to external servers without user consent, indicating malicious intent related to data exfiltration. While it does not execute harmful commands, its behavior aligns with suspicious activity typical of malicious payloads.",
