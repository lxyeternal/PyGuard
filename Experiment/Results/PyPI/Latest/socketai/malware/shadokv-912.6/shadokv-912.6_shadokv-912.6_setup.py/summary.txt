  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing external code during setup is inherently risky and potentially malicious. The current scores are appropriate, with a high likelihood that this pattern could be exploited if 'main()' contains harmful code. It is recommended to treat such packages with caution and verify the contents of 'main.py' before use."
