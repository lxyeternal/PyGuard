  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'shadokv' that includes a custom installation step to execute a function from 'main' module during installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules ('setuptools', 'install') and executes 'main' from 'main' module during installation.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' could be a sink if 'main' contains malicious code or performs malicious actions during installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the flow proceeds from the 'run' method of 'CrazyInstallStrat' class to 'main()' from 'main' module.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes code ('main()') unconditionally during install, which could be suspicious if 'main' contains malicious logic. No explicit indication of what 'main()' does, which is potentially risky.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'setuptools' to define package metadata and dependencies. The key anomaly is the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class, which overrides the 'run' method to call 'main()' from 'main' module after installation. This behavior can be benign if 'main()' is legitimate, but it is a common tactic in malicious packages to execute malicious code at install time. There are no hardcoded credentials or other suspicious code constructs. The code itself appears straightforward, but the execution of an external function ('main()') at install time warrants scrutiny, as it could contain malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious libraries are used beyond standard package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical package setup with a potentially risky custom installation step that executes 'main()' during installation. Without knowing the contents of 'main()', it is difficult to definitively classify this as malicious, but the pattern is consistent with potentially malicious behavior if 'main()' performs harmful actions. Overall, the script itself is not inherently malicious but warrants further review of 'main'.",
