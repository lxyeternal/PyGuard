      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing external code during setup is inherently risky and potentially malicious. The current scores are appropriate, with a high likelihood that this pattern could be exploited if 'main()' contains harmful code. It is recommended to treat such packages with caution and verify the contents of 'main.py' before use."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior to suspicious domains, indicating a high security risk and potential malicious intent. While no malicious payloads or obfuscation are present, the privacy invasion and covert communication justify high scores for malware and security risk. The existing reports' scores are reasonable; I recommend a malware score around 0.4-0.5 and a security risk score around 0.7, consistent with the observed behavior."
