  "conclusion": "The script is a well-structured, typical Flask CLI utility with no malicious intent or sabotage. Its use of dynamic imports and evaluation is standard and handled safely. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is justified, reflecting inherent risks in dynamic code execution but no malicious activity."
