{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and type variables for HTTP response handling, request processing, and application callbacks in a web framework, likely for Flask or Werkzeug.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, import statements, and variable definitions that specify expected data types for functions and data structures used in web request/response handling.",
  "sinks": "Type annotations themselves; no runtime data or untrusted inputs are processed or manipulated within the code; no data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Type definitions guide data flow but do not execute or process data at runtime; no actual source-to-sink data flow occurs in this static code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; code is purely type annotation and import declarations with no executable or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of import statements, conditional imports for type checking, and extensive type alias and variable definitions for web response and request handling. It does not include any runtime logic, data processing, or input/output operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to serve as type hints for a web framework, likely Flask or Werkzeug, providing static type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is safe, primarily consisting of type annotations and import statements to support type checking and static analysis. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or malware indications. No security risks are identified in this code snippet.",
