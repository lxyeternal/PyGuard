  "purpose": "Define type annotations and type aliases for a Flask/Werkzeug web application, including response types, headers, and callback functions.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and imports, especially from 'typing' and optional imports for Werkzeug and Flask types.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or external effects are executed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily sets up type aliases and type checking scaffolding.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code is purely type annotations and interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type alias definitions, import statements, and type variables designed to facilitate static type checking for a Flask/Werkzeug application. It conditionally imports types for type checking purposes, avoiding runtime dependencies. The code does not execute any logic, process untrusted data, or interact with external systems. All elements appear standard and consistent with typical Python type hinting practices for web frameworks. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type annotations for a Flask/Werkzeug application and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily enhances type checking and code clarity. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
