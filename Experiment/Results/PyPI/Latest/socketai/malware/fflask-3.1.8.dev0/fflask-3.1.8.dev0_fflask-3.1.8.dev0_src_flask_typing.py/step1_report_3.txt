{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and type aliases for a Python web application framework, likely related to Flask or Werkzeug, to assist with type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads only static type annotations, imported modules, and constant definitions. No input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could be processed or leaked, as the code only declares type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs since the code only specifies types and no executable logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code constructs, or suspicious logic. The code strictly defines type annotations and type variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, establishing type aliases, union types, and type variables for use in a web framework context. It imports typing modules, uses conditional imports for type checking, and defines various type unions for response types, headers, and callbacks. There are no executable statements, data handling, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are evident. The code serves as a static type definition module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely declarative, and intended for type checking. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
