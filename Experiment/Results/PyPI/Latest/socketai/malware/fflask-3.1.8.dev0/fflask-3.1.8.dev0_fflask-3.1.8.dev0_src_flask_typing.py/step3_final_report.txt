  "purpose": "Type annotations and type aliases for Flask/Werkzeug web application, facilitating static type checking.",
  "sources": "Import statements and type alias definitions; no runtime data or external input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static type definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward type annotations with conditional imports for type checking.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias declarations, import statements, and conditional imports for static type checking. It does not contain executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The type annotations align with standard Flask/Werkzeug patterns and serve to improve static analysis and code clarity. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static type annotation module for a Flask/Werkzeug project, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its static, non-executable nature and assign appropriate low scores. No further action or modification is necessary.",
