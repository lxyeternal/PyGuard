  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as purely type annotations, type aliases, and import statements.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is intended to support static type checking for a Flask/Werkzeug web application.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, with very low security risk scores (~0.1), which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious behavior:** None of the reports detect or claim any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree that the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Data flow and sinks:** No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines types.\n- **Type correctness:** The type annotations and union types are standard and align with typical Flask/Werkzeug patterns.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Since there's no data handling or runtime logic, potential vulnerabilities are negligible.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware: All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- Obfuscated: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Security risk: Slightly above zero (~0.1), mainly because static type definitions can sometimes be misused if combined with malicious code elsewhere, but in this isolated context, the risk is minimal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are reasonable.\n- The code is benign, with no security risks or malware.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard type annotations)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to the potential for misuse if combined with malicious code elsewhere, but not in this snippet)\n\n**Final note:** The code is purely declarative type annotation scaffolding, essential for static analysis, with no security concerns.",
