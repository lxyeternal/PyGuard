{
  "purpose": "This code defines type aliases and type variables for a web framework, specifically related to HTTP responses, headers, request lifecycle callbacks, and route handlers.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and import statements; no direct data input sources; type aliases are statically defined.",
  "sinks": "No actual data processing or untrusted data sinks present; only type definitions for static type checking.",
  "flows": "No data flows or runtime execution paths; primarily static type alias definitions for code clarity and type checking.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious code appears.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations, type variables, and import statements aimed at static type checking. There are no runtime data inputs, no processing, and no execution paths that could be exploited. It is a typical module defining type aliases for a web framework (possibly Flask or Werkzeug), with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. All constructs are standard and appropriate for static type annotations. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type alias and variable definitions module for a web framework, with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It does not perform any runtime operations or data processing that could be exploited. Overall, it is safe and has a very low malware and security risk profile.",
