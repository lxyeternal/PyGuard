{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and data structures for handling HTTP responses and related callbacks in a web framework, likely Flask or Werkzeug.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, imports, and comments that specify response types, headers, callbacks, and framework hooks.",
  "sinks": "None observed. The code does not execute external commands, handle untrusted input, or write to system resources.",
  "flows": "The code provides type definitions that could be used elsewhere in an application to ensure correct data flow but contains no executable flow itself.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. All elements are standard type annotations and documentation comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely type hinting and interface definitions for a web framework, with no runtime code, data processing, or external interactions. The use of type variables, unions, and comments aligns with standard Python typing practices. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The initial imports and type definitions are typical for a web framework's type annotations. No external data is read or written, and there are no suspicious data flows or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward, well-structured set of type annotations and documentation for a web framework, with no malicious intent, no security risks, and no obfuscation. It appears to be purely for type checking and documentation purposes, ensuring correct usage of response and callback types within the framework.",
