  "purpose": "Define a custom Blueprint class extending SansioBlueprint for a web application, managing static files, resources, and CLI commands.",
  "sources": "Configuration access from current_app, file paths from parameters, environment variables (implied via config), and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "File opening functions (open), response serving (send_from_directory), and config access (current_app.config).",
  "flows": "Config values (e.g., SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT) influence cache control, filename parameter influences file serving, resource path influences file reading.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. Use of 'open' with unvalidated paths could be risky if root_path or resource is manipulated externally, but no evidence of malicious intent. No obfuscation or malware signatures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard extension of a web framework blueprint, handling static file serving, resource opening, and CLI command grouping. It accesses configuration settings via current_app.config, and opens files based on provided paths. No data is sent over the network, no credentials are hardcoded, and no suspicious behaviors are detected. The code does not execute untrusted code or contain malicious payloads. The functions are designed to serve files and open resources safely, with validation for resource modes. No signs of supply chain sabotage or malware are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical framework extension without malicious intent. It handles file serving and resource management securely, assuming proper external validation of inputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this module.",
