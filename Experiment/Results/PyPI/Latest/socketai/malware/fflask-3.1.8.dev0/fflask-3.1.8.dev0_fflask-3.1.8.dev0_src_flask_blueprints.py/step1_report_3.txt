  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Blueprint class for a web application, extending functionality for static file serving, resource opening, and CLI integration.",
  "sources": "Configuration access via current_app.config, static folder path, filename parameters in send_static_file and open_resource methods.",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory function, open() calls for resource files.",
  "flows": "Configuration value retrieval -> serving static files with send_from_directory -> opening resource files from disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard libraries and well-known patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code extends Flask's Blueprint to add custom static file handling and resource opening. It retrieves configuration values securely from app config. File paths are constructed using os.path.join with self.root_path and resource parameters, which is standard. send_from_directory is a common Flask utility for serving static files, with max_age configurable. The open_resource method opens files for reading, enforcing read-only modes, and properly manages encoding. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No external network connections or hidden code segments are present. The code appears to be standard extension code for Flask blueprints with no suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Flask Blueprint extension for static and resource handling, with no malicious behavior detected. It properly manages configuration and file operations without introducing security issues.",
