  "purpose": "Extension of a web framework's Blueprint class to manage static files, resources, and CLI commands with standard validation and configuration-based cache control.",
  "sources": "Configuration values (current_app.config), filename and resource parameters, static_folder, root_path",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory for static files, open for resource files",
  "flows": "Configuration values influence cache duration; filename/resource parameters determine file paths; open/read operations access files",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; standard library functions used appropriately; no network activity or data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward extension of a web framework's Blueprint, handling static file serving and resource opening with validation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. File operations are limited to reading, with mode validation. Configuration values are accessed safely. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. Potential minor concern about path manipulation if inputs are not validated externally, but this is typical in such code. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and aligns with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign extension of a web framework component with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified.",
