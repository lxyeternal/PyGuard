  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes standard Flask utility functions, environment variables, request/session data, and response handling. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are noted.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Uses well-known libraries (Flask, Werkzeug). Data flows are typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is standard, safe, and free of malicious activity. Confidence is high (1), malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The scoring seems appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, standard Flask utilities, environment variables, session, and request data. No suspicious patterns.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; use of environment variables and session handling is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk, no malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2 (a bit higher than Report 1 but still low).\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are reasonable. Slightly higher security risk score reflects cautiousness but remains low. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard Flask utilities, environment variables, session, request data, safe file serving. No anomalies.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. Use of safe functions (send_file, send_from_directory) and environment variables is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very low security risk, no malware. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are consistent. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Utility functions for responses, URL, flashing, static files. Uses environment variables, request/session data, and standard Flask practices.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. File serving functions rely on Werkzeug's secure methods.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very low risk, no malware, obfuscation. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to others, standard Flask utilities, environment variables, request/session data, and file handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious code. Uses safe practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low security risk, no malware, obfuscation. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is reasonable given the straightforward, standard code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Very low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting standard utility functions with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk:** Approximately 0.1 (consistent with the low, standard utility code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores across all reports are justified and reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard Flask utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate based on the analysis.",
