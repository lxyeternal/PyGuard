  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for a Flask-based web application, including response handling, URL generation, file sending, flashing messages, and request context management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (FLASK_DEBUG, FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV), request context (_cv_request), session data (_flashes), request environment (request.environ), and input parameters to functions like send_file, send_from_directory, url_for, redirect, abort.",
  "sinks": "Werkzeug's send_file and send_from_directory functions, response creation (make_response), URL generation (current_app.url_for), redirect responses, abort exceptions, and message flashing (session storage and message_flashed signal).",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> get_debug_flag/get_load_dotenv; Request data -> stream_with_context, send_file, send_from_directory, url_for, flash; User input via function parameters -> send_file, send_from_directory, url_for, redirect, abort, message flash; Response creation and modifications -> make_response, send_file, send_from_directory, redirect, flash, get_flashed_messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. Usage of environment variables for configuration is standard. No obfuscated or unusual code patterns observed. No hidden backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious network activity. Code flows are standard for Flask utilities. The only potential concern is the unrestricted use of environment variables for configuration, but this is typical for Flask apps and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Flask utility functions for response handling, URL building, file serving, message flashing, and request context management. It reads environment variables for configuration flags, manipulates session data for flashed messages, and interfaces with Werkzeug for core HTTP functionalities. There are no signs of malicious code such as network connections to unknown domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All data flows and sources are within typical web application practices, with no suspicious logic or obfuscation. The use of environment variables is standard for Flask apps, and no secrets are hardcoded. The functions rely on trusted Flask and Werkzeug libraries, which are well-known open-source components.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of Flask utility functions for common web app operations. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code flows. It adheres to typical Flask patterns for configuration, response creation, file handling, and messaging. The code appears safe and standard, with no security risks identified based on the code review.",
