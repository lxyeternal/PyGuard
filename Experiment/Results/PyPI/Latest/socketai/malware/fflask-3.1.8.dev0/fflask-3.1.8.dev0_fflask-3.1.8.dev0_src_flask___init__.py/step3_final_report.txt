  "purpose": "Static import statements exposing internal modules of a web framework, likely Flask.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules such as .app, .blueprints, .config, .ctx, .globals, .helpers, .signals, .templating, .wrappers.",
  "sinks": "None; no data handling, external inputs, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; purely static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements, typical of a framework's __init__.py or setup module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is standard for exposing internal components of a web framework like Flask, with no dynamic execution, data leaks, or network activity. All signals indicate benign, intentional design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its nature, and the scores should reflect zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
