  "purpose": "The code provides debugging utilities, custom exception classes, and functions to enhance error reporting and template loading diagnostics within a Flask-like web framework.",
  "sources": "Request data such as request.files, request.form, request.url, request.mimetype, request.blueprint; loader attributes; request context.",
  "sinks": "Raising custom exceptions, modifying request.files.__class__, logging detailed loader and template attempt info.",
  "flows": "Request data -> error handling and diagnostics -> logs/exceptions",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic class modification for request.files, detailed debug info potentially exposing sensitive data, no malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions and exception classes aimed at debugging and error reporting. It dynamically patches request.files to improve error messages, which is a common debugging pattern. The functions that log loader info and template attempts are diagnostic and do not perform any malicious activity. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The detailed logs could expose sensitive request info if logs are insecure, but this is a typical trade-off for debugging utilities. The code is clear, readable, and free of obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), mainly due to potential info leakage via logs, but no active security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of debugging and error handling utilities with no malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential info exposure if logs are not secured. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
