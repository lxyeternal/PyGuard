{
  "purpose": "The code performs an immediate download and execution of an external executable from a base64-decoded URL during module import, indicating malicious supply chain activity.",
  "sources": "Top-level code that reads environment variable 'TEMP', decodes base64 string to URL, downloads executable, and runs it via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executes the downloaded file, leading to remote code execution and potential system compromise.",
  "flows": "Source: base64 decoding and URL retrieval; Sink: subprocess.Popen executing the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of malicious payload at module load time, outside of any function or class, with no validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly performs a base64 decoding of a URL, downloads an executable into the TEMP directory, and runs it silently upon import. This behavior is characteristic of malware and supply chain attacks. The rest of the Flask application code appears standard and benign. The malicious snippet is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and executes without user interaction or validation, confirming malicious intent. The malware score is justified as 1, risk score as 1, and obfuscation as 0, given the code's transparency. Confidence is high due to the explicit nature of the malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear, high-confidence supply chain attack vector, executing external malware during module import. The activity is malicious, and the scores reflect this severity accurately. No further adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
