  "purpose": "Automates installation, uninstallation, and update processes for the 'simufact' product, managing files, environment variables, and system processes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., 'IS_REL', 'MARKEXPR', 'SHARED_PATH', 'SPE_NUM'), filesystem (file existence, globbing), process information (psutil), user directories (~), and input files (downloaded archives).",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to execute installers/uninstallers, file copying and extraction, process management (kill, wait for processes), and logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence paths and behavior; downloaded build files are copied and extracted; subprocess commands execute installers/uninstallers; process monitoring waits for uninstaller completion; files are read/written to track versions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with shell=True, reliance on environment variables without validation, no input sanitization, no network activity or obfuscation, and standard installer logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical installer management tasks, including downloading, extracting, installing, and uninstalling software. It uses environment variables to control behavior, which is common but should be validated. The subprocess calls with shell=True could pose risks if inputs are manipulated, but in this context, inputs are controlled paths and variables. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The process management routines are standard for uninstallers. Overall, the script appears legitimate and low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard installer automation tool with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of subprocess with shell=True warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent given controlled inputs. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The overall security risk is very low.",
