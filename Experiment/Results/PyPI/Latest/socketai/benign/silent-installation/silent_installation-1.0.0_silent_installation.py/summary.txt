  "conclusion": "The script is a standard installer automation tool with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of subprocess with shell=True warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent given controlled inputs. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The overall security risk is very low."
