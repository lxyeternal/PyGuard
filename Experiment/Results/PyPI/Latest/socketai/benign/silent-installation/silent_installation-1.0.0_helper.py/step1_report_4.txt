  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to remove directories, kill processes by name, and extract ZIP files using 7-Zip.",
  "sources": "os.listdir, psutil.process_iter, subprocess.check_call, input parameters (zip_file, target_dir), process.name()",
  "sinks": "os.remove, os.rmdir, process.kill, subprocess.check_call",
  "flows": "Input parameters (zip_file, target_dir) used in subprocess call for extraction; process names read in kill_process; file paths read in remove_folder; data flows from inputs to filesystem or process control",
  "anomalies": "Use of shell=True in subprocess, which can lead to command injection if input is not sanitized; no validation or sanitization of file paths or process names; broad process termination capability; no error handling for process killing failures beyond logging",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to delete directories recursively, terminate processes by name, and extract ZIP files with 7-Zip. The removal functions directly delete files/directories without validation. kill_process can terminate any process matching the name, which could be misused for disruptive actions. The unzip_file function uses subprocess with shell=True, posing a risk if zip_file contains malicious content or is constructed maliciously. No authentication or validation mechanisms are present. Overall, the code could be exploited to delete critical files, kill important processes, or execute arbitrary commands if inputs are maliciously crafted.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs potentially dangerous system modifications—file deletion, process termination, and file extraction—without validation or safeguards. The use of shell=True in subprocess introduces a high security risk if inputs are untrusted. These functions could be exploited maliciously to disrupt or damage the system, especially in an environment where input parameters are not controlled or sanitized.",
