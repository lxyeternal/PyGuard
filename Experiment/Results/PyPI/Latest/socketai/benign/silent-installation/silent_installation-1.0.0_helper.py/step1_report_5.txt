{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for system maintenance tasks such as removing directories, killing processes, and unzipping files.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters: 'root', 'process_name', 'zip_file', and 'target_dir'. It also interacts with the system via os.listdir, os.path, psutil.process_iter, and subprocess.check_call.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include 'os.remove', 'os.rmdir', 'process.kill()', and 'subprocess.check_call'. These can lead to file deletion, process termination, or command execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from parameters (file paths, process names) to system calls: input parameters are used to identify files/processes, which are then acted upon via deletion, killing, or extraction commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; process killing and file deletion are generic and could be misused if invoked maliciously. Use of shell=True in subprocess can be risky if inputs are untrusted, but no malicious intent is evident. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code contains functions for removing directories, killing processes by name, and unzipping files using 7z via subprocess. All operations involve system modifications. While these functions are not inherently malicious, they could be exploited if misused. The use of 'shell=True' in subprocess is a security concern if the inputs are untrusted, but no specific malicious behavior is observed. The code itself does not perform any malicious actions; it is a utility suite. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides legitimate system management functions without evident malicious intent. The main security concern is the potential misuse of these functions if invoked with malicious inputs, but there are no malicious behaviors within the code itself. Overall, low likelihood of malicious activity.",
