{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for removing directories, killing processes by name, and extracting zip files, likely for system maintenance or cleanup tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the filesystem (os.listdir, os.path functions), process information (psutil.process_iter), and external commands (subprocess.check_call).",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call to '7z' can execute external commands, potentially leading to command injection if inputs are untrusted. The process.kill() method terminates system processes, which could disrupt system operations if misused.",
  "flows": "Untrusted inputs (zip_file, target_dir, process_name) flow into subprocess commands and process termination functions. The removal functions process filesystem paths, which could be manipulated if inputs are insecure.",
  "anomalies": "The use of shell=True in subprocess without input sanitization can be risky. No explicit validation or sanitization of input parameters is present. The code uses broad except clauses, which may hide exceptions or malicious triggers.",
  "analysis": "The functions are standard utility routines with no embedded malicious logic. The subprocess call with shell=True is a potential security risk if inputs are untrusted, as it can allow command injection. The process-killing function can disrupt system processes, but this is a feature rather than malware. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and does not obfuscate its operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system cleanup and process management functions without evidence of malicious intent. The only concern is the insecure use of subprocess with shell=True, which could be exploited if inputs are not sanitized. Overall, it appears to be legitimate utility code with a moderate security risk if used improperly.",
