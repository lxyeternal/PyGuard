  "flows": "Input data from file system or process list flows into deletion, killing processes, or extracting archives",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with shell=True; no validation or sanitization of inputs; minimal error handling; no logging of process identifiers or validation of process names; potential for command injection via zip_file parameter",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to remove directories/files, kill processes by name, and unzip files using 7-Zip. The remove_folder function recursively deletes files and directories, logging failures. kill_process searches for processes by name or regex, then kills them, with error handling that logs warnings. unzip_file uses subprocess to call 7-Zip with shell=True, which can be dangerous if inputs are untrusted. There are no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code performs system modifications and process termination, which could be misused, but as-is, it does not contain malicious intent or obfuscated code. The subprocess call's use of shell=True could lead to command injection if inputs are not sanitized, posing a security risk. Overall, the code performs system management tasks but does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The potential security concern lies in the unsafe subprocess call, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate system management functions with no explicit malicious behavior. However, the use of subprocess with shell=True without input validation introduces a security risk that could be exploited for command injection. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The overall security risk is low to moderate, primarily due to input handling in subprocess.",
