  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with shell=True without input validation; broad except clauses hiding errors",
  "analysis": "The code provides system management utilities with straightforward logic. The primary security concern is the use of subprocess.check_call with shell=True, which can lead to command injection if inputs are untrusted. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The functions could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or payloads. The process-killing and file-deletion functions are standard but potentially disruptive if misused. The code's structure is clear, and no obfuscation techniques are used. The security risk is moderate due to unsafe subprocess usage, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of system utility functions with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security concern is the unsafe handling of subprocess calls with untrusted inputs, which could be exploited for command injection. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.4, reflecting moderate risk due to potential misuse. Proper input validation and avoiding shell=True or sanitizing inputs would mitigate these risks.",
