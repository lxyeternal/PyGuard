      "conclusion": "The code is a set of system utility functions with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security concern is the unsafe handling of subprocess calls with untrusted inputs, which could be exploited for command injection. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.4, reflecting moderate risk due to potential misuse. Proper input validation and avoiding shell=True or sanitizing inputs would mitigate these risks."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The script is a standard installer automation tool with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of subprocess with shell=True warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent given controlled inputs. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The overall security risk is very low."
