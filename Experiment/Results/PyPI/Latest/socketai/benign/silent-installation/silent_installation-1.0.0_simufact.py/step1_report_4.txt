{
  "purpose": "Define a class that manages product names and associated process names for a manufacturing simulation or process management system.",
  "sources": "Constantly accessed class variables and class initialization which set predefined product and process names.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output, network communication, or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class variables to internal list of namedtuples; no untrusted input flows or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and primarily defines static data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a namedtuple 'Prod' and a class '_Simufact' that initializes a list of products with specific process names. It includes a method to retrieve products by name, raising an error if the name is invalid. No external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. The code is static and purpose-driven without any obfuscated or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing a simple data structure for product and process management. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
