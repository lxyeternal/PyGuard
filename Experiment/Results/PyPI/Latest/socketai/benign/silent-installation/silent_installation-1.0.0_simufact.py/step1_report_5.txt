{
  "purpose": "Define a class _Simufact with predefined product and process names, and create an instance simufactIns.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; only internal class attributes and initializations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward class definition and instance creation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a namedtuple 'Prod' and a class '_Simufact' that initializes a list of products with associated process names. The class provides a method to retrieve product info by name, raising an error if invalid. There are no external inputs, no network activity, no credential handling, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The overall structure appears to be a simple, static data setup for process management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup of internal data structures representing manufacturing processes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no external data handling, or suspicious activities. It is a straightforward implementation with no security concerns.",
