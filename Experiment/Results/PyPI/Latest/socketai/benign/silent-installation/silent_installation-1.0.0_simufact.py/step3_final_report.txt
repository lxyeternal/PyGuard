{
  "purpose": "Static data management of production types and process names within a manufacturing context.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded production names and process names within class variables and list comprehensions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A - static data; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a namedtuple 'Prod' and a class '_Simufact' with static lists of production and process names. It provides a method to retrieve production info by name. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network or file operations, and no obfuscation. The code's purpose appears to be internal configuration management. Given its static nature and lack of suspicious behavior, there are no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments are accurate, and no modifications to the scores are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
