  "purpose": "Define a class for handling specific manufacturing process products and their associated process names.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user input; the code only uses internal class attributes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is used; the code does not process external input or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no external data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be straightforward data structure definition and access without any suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a named tuple 'Prod' and a class '_Simufact' with hardcoded process names and product names. The class initializes a list of 'Prod' instances with fixed data, and provides a method to retrieve a product by name. There are no dynamic data inputs, no network calls, no file operations, and no code obfuscation. The code seems purely for internal data management without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign internal utility for managing process names associated with manufacturing products. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe to use based on the provided snippet.",
