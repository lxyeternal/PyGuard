{
  "purpose": "Defines a namedtuple 'Prod' and a class '_Simufact' to manage product names and associated process names, providing access to product info via indexing.",
  "sources": "The class constructor and __getitem__ method read static class variables and instantiate data; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted data or perform data output that could lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only handles internal static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior observed. The code is straightforward and uses standard library features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data structure and a class for managing product-related information with static, hardcoded data. There are no external inputs, no data processing that could lead to security issues, and no dynamic or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a simple, static configuration or lookup utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is a benign, static data management implementation.",
