{
  "purpose": "Defines a class to manage production types and their associated process names for a simulation or manufacturing context.",
  "sources": "Class initialization (__init__) method which sets up internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, no user input, no network activity, no file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes (PROD_NAMES, PROC_NAMES) to internal _prods list, accessed via __getitem__ method.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded production names and process names are straightforward and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a namedtuple 'Prod' and a class '_Simufact' that initializes a list of production types with associated process names. The class provides access to these production types via __getitem__. All data is hardcoded; no external input, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious data handling. The structure appears to be a simple data container with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for managing predefined production process names and aliases. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no suspicious external interactions.",
