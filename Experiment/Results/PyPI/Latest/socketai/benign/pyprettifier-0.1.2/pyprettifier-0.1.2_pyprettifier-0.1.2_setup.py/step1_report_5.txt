  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the Python package 'pyprettifier', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or external connections.",
  "flows": "Reading file content as long_description during setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities, reads a local README.md file to include as long_description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. It uses standard setuptools functions and does not perform any dynamic execution, network operations, or data handling from untrusted sources. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
