{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'pyprettifier' with specified metadata and dependencies, facilitating its installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the current directory path (__file__), reads the content of 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is written or transmitted untrusted data, no insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Reads file paths and package information, which are static and trusted sources. No flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, or obfuscated code. Uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities, reads a local README file for the long description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts. No indication of malicious activity, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. No suspicious code flows or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a benign and well-structured setup script.",
