  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. Usage of standard setup tools and straightforward file reading.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions from setuptools, reads the README.md file to include a long description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No untrusted data sources, no suspicious code paths, no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It simply reads a markdown file and configures package metadata. No security risks detected.",
