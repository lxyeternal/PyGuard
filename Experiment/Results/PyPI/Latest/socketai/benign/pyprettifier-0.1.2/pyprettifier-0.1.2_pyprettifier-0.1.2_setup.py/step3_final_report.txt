  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python package setup script used to configure and distribute the 'pyprettifier' package.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; no untrusted data sources or external inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects; the code does not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> passes metadata to setup() -> completes installation; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script utilizing standard modules ('setuptools', 'pathlib') to package a Python project. It reads a local README file safely and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted data. The code structure is typical and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0. No modifications are necessary.",
