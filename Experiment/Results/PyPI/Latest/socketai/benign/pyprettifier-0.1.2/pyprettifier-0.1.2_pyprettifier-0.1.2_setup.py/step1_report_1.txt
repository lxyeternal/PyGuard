  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the Python package 'pyprettifier', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; importing modules from setuptools and pathlib.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external output that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily reads a local file to set package description.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns detected. The code is standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for package setup, reads a local markdown file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. There is no indication of malicious activity, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code. The code performs typical package configuration tasks without dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be legitimate and safe for use.",
