  "purpose": "To import the EmojiConverter class from the local emoji_converter module, exposing it at the package level.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statement from the local module 'emoji_converter'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file that imports a class from a local module. It contains no data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is standard for package initialization. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization file that imports a class from a local module. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
