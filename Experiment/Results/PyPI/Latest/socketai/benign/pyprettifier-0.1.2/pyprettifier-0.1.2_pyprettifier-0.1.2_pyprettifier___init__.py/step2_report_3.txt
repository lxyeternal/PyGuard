  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe code snippet is a minimal __init__.py file that imports a class from a local module:\n```python\nfrom .emoji_converter import EmojiConverter\n```\nThis is a standard practice in Python packages to expose classes or functions at the package level.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Errors or flaws:** None. The import statement is correct and typical for package initialization.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. This is appropriate, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which is correct; the code is clear and simple.\n- **Security risk score:** 0, as there are no security-sensitive operations or data flows.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is purely a static import, with no data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The reports consistently identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n### Consistency and potential adjustments:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- The high confidence (1) and zero scores for malware and obfuscation are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical package initialization file with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores reflect this accurately.",
