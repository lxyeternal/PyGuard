{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for converting between emoji names and characters, replacing emojis in strings, and removing emojis from strings.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'text' parameter in various static methods, which are string inputs provided at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs processed strings after replacing or removing emojis. No direct data leaks or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input text flows into methods such as replace_string_with_emoji, replace_emojis_with_string, replace_emojis_with_alternatives, and remove_emojis; these process the text and return modified strings.",
  "anomalies": "The emoji_dict contains duplicate entries for ':rocket:' and ':alien:', but this does not impact execution or indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code uses straightforward string replacements without any dynamic code execution or external data access.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility class for emoji conversion and manipulation. It uses static dictionaries and methods, with no external dependencies, network access, or suspicious operations. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is detected. The only potential concern was the duplicate key entries, which are benign and do not introduce malicious intent. The code structure and implementation are clear, readable, and standard for such utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign emoji utility class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs simple string manipulations related to emojis and does not include any harmful or suspicious operations.",
