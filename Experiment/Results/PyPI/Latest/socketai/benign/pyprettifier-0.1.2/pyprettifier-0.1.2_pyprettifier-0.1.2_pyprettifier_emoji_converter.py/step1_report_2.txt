{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for converting emoji names to characters, replacing emoji names in strings with emojis, converting emojis back to their names, replacing emojis with custom alternatives, and removing emojis from text.",
  "sources": "Reads input strings in methods such as replace_string_with_emoji, replace_emojis_with_string, replace_emojis_with_alternatives, and remove_emojis.",
  "sinks": "Outputs modified strings after replacing or removing emojis; no data is sent externally or stored maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through various replace or removal functions; data flows from source input to processed output within the functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The emoji dictionary is extensive but standard. No obfuscated code or hidden logic observed. No network activity, file access, or environment variable misuse.",
  "analysis": "The code solely manipulates string data related to emojis, with no external data access, network operations, or system modifications. All functions perform straightforward replacements or removals based on a predefined emoji dictionary. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated segments, or malicious logic. The use of dictionaries and string operations is standard and safe. The duplicate entries for ':rocket:' and ':alien:' are benign but indicate possible redundancy. Overall, the code appears to serve a purely cosmetic and formatting purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a set of utility functions for emoji processing with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and purely focused on string manipulation related to emojis.",
