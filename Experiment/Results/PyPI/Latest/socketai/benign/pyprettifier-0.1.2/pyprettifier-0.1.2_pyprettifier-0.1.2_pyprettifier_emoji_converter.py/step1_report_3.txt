{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to convert between emoji names and emoji characters, replace emojis in text with their names or alternative strings, and remove emojis from text.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'emoji_name' strings passed to methods and the 'text' strings that may contain emojis or emoji tags.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the string replacement operations that could process untrusted input, but they are used solely for text manipulation and do not execute code or access sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (e.g., text with emojis or emoji tags) flows through replacement functions that map emojis to strings or vice versa, but no data is sent externally or used maliciously within the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains duplicate keys for ':rocket:' and ':alien:' in 'emoji_dict', which could cause key overwriting but does not introduce malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are present. The functions are straightforward and primarily perform text substitutions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static dictionary mapping emoji names to emoji characters and provides several static methods for converting and replacing emojis in text. The methods use standard dictionary lookups and string replacement operations. No external network calls, code execution, or access to sensitive information are present. The duplicate key entries are likely oversight but do not pose security risks. The logic is simple and intended for emoji handling only. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for emoji processing, with no malicious intent, security vulnerabilities, or suspicious behaviors. The duplicate keys are minor data issues but do not affect security. Overall, the code appears safe and suitable for use.",
