  "purpose": "A utility class for emoji conversion, replacement, and removal, providing functions to convert emoji names to characters, replace emoji names in text, replace emojis with names, replace emojis with alternatives, and remove emojis from text.",
  "sources": "Reads input text for emoji names or emoji characters; accesses the emoji_dict for mappings.",
  "sinks": "Replaces substrings in the input text; no external data or system interaction occurs.",
  "flows": "Input text → functions perform string replacements using emoji_dict → output text with emojis or names replaced or removed.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate keys for ':rocket:' and ':alien:' in emoji_dict, which overwrite previous entries but do not cause runtime errors or security issues.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static utility class with functions for emoji conversion and manipulation. It uses a static dictionary for mappings, with no external dependencies or dynamic code execution. The duplicate keys in emoji_dict are benign, as they result in data overwriting but do not introduce malicious behavior. The functions perform simple string replacements, which are safe. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The malware scores are correctly set to 0, and security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. The code does not handle sensitive data or perform any network operations. Overall, the code is safe, clear, and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility for emoji handling with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor issue is duplicate keys in the emoji_dict, which do not impact security. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the security risk score is minimal. The code is safe for use and poses no security threat.",
