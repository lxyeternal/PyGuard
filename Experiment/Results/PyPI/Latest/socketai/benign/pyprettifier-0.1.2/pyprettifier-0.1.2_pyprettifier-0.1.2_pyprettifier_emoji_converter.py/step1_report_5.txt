  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for converting between emoji names and characters, and manipulating strings containing emojis.",
  "sources": "Input text strings in methods 'replace_string_with_emoji', 'replace_emojis_with_string', 'replace_emojis_with_alternatives', and 'remove_emojis'.",
  "sinks": "Replacements and modifications of input strings, but no direct data leaks, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Input text flows through replacement functions that convert emoji names to characters, characters to names, or remove emojis; no untrusted data flows to insecure sinks like network or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The emoji dictionary is extensive but static. No obfuscated or malicious code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of emoji conversion and removal utilities. It uses static dictionaries for conversions, iterates over these dictionaries for replacements, and performs simple string operations. No external input/output, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The methods are standard, safe, and serve a benign purpose. The repeated definition of 'emoji' in the dictionary (duplicate keys for ':rocket:' and ':alien:') does not affect runtime due to Python's dictionary behavior but indicates minor redundancy. Overall, the code performs non-malicious string processing with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions for emoji handling with no signs of malicious intent or security threats. It is well-structured, and its operations are safe. No malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
