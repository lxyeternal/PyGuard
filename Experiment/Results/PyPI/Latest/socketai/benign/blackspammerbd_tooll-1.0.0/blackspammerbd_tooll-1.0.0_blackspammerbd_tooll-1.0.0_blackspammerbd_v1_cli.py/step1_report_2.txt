  "purpose": "This script provides a CLI tool for generating, verifying, listing files, and encoding/decoding files in Base64, ostensibly for managing connection codes and file transfers.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'connection_code.txt', reads files specified for encoding/decoding, reads environment variables (none explicitly used), reads user input via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writes connection codes to 'connection_code.txt', writes Base64 encoded data to '<filename>.b64', writes decoded files with prefix 'uploaded_'.",
  "flows": "Generating code → saving to file → reading code for verification; listing directory contents; encoding file contents → saving Base64 string; decoding Base64 string → saving decoded content.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.randint for code generation (not cryptographically secure), no input validation beyond file existence, no network activity or data exfiltration, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no suspicious obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file and string operations without suspicious network activity or data leaks. The connection code is generated using insecure randomness but does not transmit data externally. Encoding and decoding are standard Base64 operations without malicious intent. No environment variables, external API calls, or embedded secrets are present. The structure is clear, with standard command-line interface handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The only concern is the use of insecure randomness for connection codes, which is more a security weakness than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign CLI tool for managing connection codes and file encoding/decoding. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Its security risk is low, with minor concerns about randomness security.",
