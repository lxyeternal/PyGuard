  "purpose": "Importing the class 'BlackSpammerBD' from the local 'core' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The import statement itself does not create data flows or execute code.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'BlackSpammerBD' may suggest potentially malicious intent, as 'Spammer' implies spam or abuse functionality, but no actual malicious code or behavior is present in this single line.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a relative module. There are no direct signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution. The class name could be suspicious, but without further context or implementation details, this cannot be confirmed. No obfuscation, external network activity, or suspicious code is present here.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of a potentially suspicious class name warrants caution if the imported class contains malicious code, but the code snippet itself is benign.",
