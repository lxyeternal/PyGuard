  "purpose": "The code imports the class 'BlackSpammerBD' from a local module named 'core', likely for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are established in this snippet; only an import statement is shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no obvious anomalies or suspicious patterns. The class name 'BlackSpammerBD' may suggest malicious intent based solely on naming, but the import statement itself does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module. There are no apparent sources of untrusted data, no sinks that could leak data or perform harmful actions, and no flows to analyze. The naming of the class could be suspicious, but without additional context or code, this cannot be confirmed. The snippet alone does not exhibit malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, consisting solely of an import statement. There are no indications of malicious activity or security risks in this fragment.",
