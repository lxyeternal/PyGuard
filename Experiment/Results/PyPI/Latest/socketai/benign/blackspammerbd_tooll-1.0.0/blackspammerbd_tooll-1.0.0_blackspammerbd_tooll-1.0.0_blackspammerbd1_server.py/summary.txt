  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, insecure file server that does not contain malicious code but poses significant security risks due to lack of access controls. The malware score should be 0, obfuscation is absent, and the security risk is high (~0.7). It is recommended to implement authentication, input validation, and access restrictions to mitigate potential misuse."
