  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, safe packaging script with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern relates to the potential misuse of the package based on its name, but the code itself is benign. The malware and obfuscated scores are set to 0, and the security risk score should be low (~0.2-0.3) to reflect caution about the package's purpose rather than its implementation."
