  "sources": "Package metadata, dependencies, and entry point declaration",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'blackspammerbd_tooll.cli:main' when CLI command 'bsb' is invoked",
  "flows": "From setup parameters to the CLI entry point; actual runtime behavior depends on 'cli.py' implementation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or anomalies detected in this script",
  "analysis": "The setup.py is a typical, benign packaging script using setuptools. It specifies package info, dependencies ('colorama', 'requests'), and an entry point for CLI execution. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The security concern hinges on the contents of 'cli.py', which is not provided. The package name 'blackspammerbd_tooll' is unusual and potentially suspicious, but this does not affect the safety of the setup script itself. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. The security risk score could be slightly elevated due to the package name, but based solely on this code, it remains low. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, safe packaging script with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern relates to the potential misuse of the package based on its name, but the code itself is benign. The malware and obfuscated scores are set to 0, and the security risk score should be low (~0.2-0.3) to reflect caution about the package's purpose rather than its implementation.",
