  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'blackspammerbd_tooll', including package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including package metadata, dependencies, and entry point definition.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'blackspammerbd_tooll.cli:main' when the console script is invoked.",
  "flows": "User runs 'bsb' command → invokes 'blackspammerbd_tooll.cli:main' → executes package's CLI main function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears to be a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and defines a console script entry point. No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. The entry point points to a CLI main function, which could contain malicious behavior, but this cannot be determined from the setup script alone. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal Python package setup configuration without evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package setup script. No malicious intent or malicious code detected in this file.",
