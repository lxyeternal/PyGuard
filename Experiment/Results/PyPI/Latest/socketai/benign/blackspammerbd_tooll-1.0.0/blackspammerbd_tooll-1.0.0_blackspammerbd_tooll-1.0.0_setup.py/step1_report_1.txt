  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'blackspammerbd_tooll' Python package, including package discovery, entry points, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "N/A (setup script). The script sources data from the package's own metadata and dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of entry point 'blackspammerbd_tooll.cli:main', which may execute user-defined CLI code.",
  "flows": "During installation, dependencies are installed; upon execution, the 'bsb' command triggers the 'main' function in 'cli.py'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It specifies metadata, dependencies, and entry points. The dependencies 'colorama' and 'requests' are common and safe. The entry point points to a CLI script, which may execute user code, but no specific malicious behavior is indicated in this setup script. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
