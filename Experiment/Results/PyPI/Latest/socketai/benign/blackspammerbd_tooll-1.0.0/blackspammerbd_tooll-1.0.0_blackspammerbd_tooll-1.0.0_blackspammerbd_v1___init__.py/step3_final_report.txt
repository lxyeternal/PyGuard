  "purpose": "Placeholder comment indicating package initialization; no executable code present.",
  "sources": "None; the code is only a comment with no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows, external calls, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists due to absence of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple comment with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet contains only a comment indicating package initialization, with no executable code, variables, or data flows. All reports correctly identify the lack of implementation and malicious activity. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0. Confidence scores vary, but given the minimal content, high confidence in the absence of malicious behavior is justified. No suspicious signals or vulnerabilities are present, and the code appears to be a placeholder or documentation comment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of a comment with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero. The high confidence in the benign nature of this snippet is justified given the lack of executable content.",
