  "sources": "No explicit data input sources identified in the provided snippet",
  "sinks": "No explicit data output sinks or network interactions identified",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows observed in the provided code",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet is only a comment line with no executable code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains only a single comment indicating the package initialization. There are no functions, data reads, writes, network calls, or other executable logic present. Without actual code, it is not possible for this snippet to contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The absence of code means there are no identifiable sources, sinks, or flows, and no anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided comment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The snippet appears to be a simple comment header for the package initialization, and no further analysis can be performed without additional code.",
