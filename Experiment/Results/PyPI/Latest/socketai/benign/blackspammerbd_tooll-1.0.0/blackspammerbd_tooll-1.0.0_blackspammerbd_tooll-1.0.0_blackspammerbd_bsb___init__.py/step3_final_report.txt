  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only a comment indicating package initialization, with no executable code or behavior.",
  "sources": "No sources; the snippet is solely a comment line.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; absence of code prevents any source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the snippet is just a comment with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a single comment line, providing no executable code, data handling, or network activity. All previous reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are justified given the minimal content. Confidence levels vary appropriately based on the limited information, with high confidence where explicitly no code exists. No evidence suggests malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The package name hints at potential misuse, but no supporting code or behavior is present to substantiate this.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, consisting solely of a comment. All assessments and scores are appropriate and justified. No further action is necessary based on this snippet.",
