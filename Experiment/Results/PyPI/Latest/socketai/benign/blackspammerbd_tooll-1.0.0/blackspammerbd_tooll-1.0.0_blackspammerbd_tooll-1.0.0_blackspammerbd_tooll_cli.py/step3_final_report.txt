  "purpose": "Provides CLI for establishing secure device connections and performing file transfers via TCP, with simple authentication using an 8-digit secret code.",
  "sources": "Reads input from user for commands, reads/writes files for upload/download, loads secret code from hidden file, receives data over socket connections.",
  "sinks": "Sends/receives data over socket connections, writes files to disk, reads files from disk, reads user input.",
  "flows": "Secret code generated and stored; client sends code to server; server authenticates; commands like list, download, upload executed via socket data exchange; files encoded/decoded with base64.",
  "anomalies": "Uses non-cryptographic `random.randint()` for secret code; secret code stored in plaintext with permission 600; data transmitted unencrypted over sockets; no obfuscation or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward TCP client-server file transfer with authentication. It generates an 8-digit numeric secret code using `random.randint()`, stores it in a plaintext file with restricted permissions, and uses it for authentication. Data transfer occurs over plain sockets with base64 encoding, lacking encryption. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The security weaknesses relate to predictable secret generation and unencrypted data, but these do not indicate malicious intent. The code's structure is clear and functional, with no suspicious behaviors or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, simple remote connection and file transfer utility with security weaknesses but no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.3) due to security design choices, not malicious intent.",
