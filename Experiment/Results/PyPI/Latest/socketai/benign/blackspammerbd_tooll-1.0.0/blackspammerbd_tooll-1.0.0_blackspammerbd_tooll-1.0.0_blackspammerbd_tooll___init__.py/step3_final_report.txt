  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only a comment indicating package initialization, with no executable code or data flows.",
  "sources": "None; the snippet is only a comment.",
  "sinks": "None; no data or untrusted input is processed.",
  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink paths exist.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code; package name 'blackspammerbd_tooll' suggests potential malicious intent but no evidence in the snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely a comment with no executable content, functions, or data interactions. The package name raises suspicion but is not substantiated by code behavior. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The risk score is minimal, primarily due to the suspicious name, but no actual malicious activity is present. Confidence in this assessment is high given the minimal evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is benign, containing only a comment. The suspicion based on the package name remains unsubstantiated without further code. Scores reflect low risk and no malware presence.",
