  "purpose": "A standard gRPC client for interacting with an NLP server, managing secure channels, authentication, and RPC calls.",
  "sources": "Host and port parameters, environment variables for tokens, protobuf stub methods.",
  "sinks": "RPC method calls, metadata callback transmitting auth tokens, network transmission.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, tokens) used to establish channels; stub method calls transmitting requests and receiving responses.",
  "anomalies": "The method 'list_embedding_models' calls 'RemoveContent' instead of 'GetEmbeddingModels', likely a typo or bug.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured gRPC client with no malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. It handles credentials and secure channels appropriately. The only anomaly is the repeated typo in 'list_embedding_models', which does not indicate malicious intent but should be corrected for correctness. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of tokens in metadata callbacks is standard practice. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to the minor bug and network interactions, which pose no significant threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard gRPC client with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only issue is a minor typo in a method call, which does not impact security. The overall security risk is very low, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
