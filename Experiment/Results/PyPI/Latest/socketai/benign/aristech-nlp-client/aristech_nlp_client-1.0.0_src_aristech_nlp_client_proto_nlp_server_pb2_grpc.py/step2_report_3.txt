  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies that the code is generated gRPC boilerplate for an NLP service.  \n- **Sources & Sinks:** Standard imports and method handlers; no external untrusted data sources or sinks beyond typical gRPC serialization/deserialization.  \n- **Flows:** Straightforward data flow during RPCs, no dynamic or external code execution.  \n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly concludes that this is boilerplate code with no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — **Reasonable.**\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is generated, with unimplemented methods raising errors, standard version checks, and no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Focuses on server stubs and version checks, all methods are placeholders.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — **Valid.**\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Highlights the auto-generated nature, standard pattern, and placeholder methods.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — **Consistent.**\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Slightly less confident (confidence=0.9, securityRisk=0.1), but still emphasizes that the code is boilerplate, with no malicious logic, and only standard serialization/deserialization.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — **Acceptable, given the conservative approach.**\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are any issues present in the code?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that this is generated gRPC boilerplate code with no active logic, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent, thorough, and accurate.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is correct. The risk scores are all 0 or very close to it, reflecting no real security concern.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports justify higher scores. The code is standard, generated, and contains no active logic or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Zero in all cases is correct; no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as boilerplate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and well-justified.**  \n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and generated.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard generated gRPC interface for an NLP service, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
