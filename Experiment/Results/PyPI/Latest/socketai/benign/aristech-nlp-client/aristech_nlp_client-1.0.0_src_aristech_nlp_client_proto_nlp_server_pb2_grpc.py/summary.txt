  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious, generated gRPC interface with no signs of security vulnerabilities or obfuscation. It enforces version compatibility but does not introduce any security risks. All methods are placeholders, indicating that actual implementation resides elsewhere. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero."
