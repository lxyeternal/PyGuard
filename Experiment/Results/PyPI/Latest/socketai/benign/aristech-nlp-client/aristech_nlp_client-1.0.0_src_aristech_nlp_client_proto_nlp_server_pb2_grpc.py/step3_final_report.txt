  "purpose": "This code is auto-generated gRPC client and server interface code for a protobuf-defined NLP service, including version checks and method definitions. It serves as boilerplate for RPC communication without active logic.",
  "sources": "Imports of protobuf modules, version check functions, and method handler definitions within the generated code.",
  "sinks": "Serialization and deserialization of protobuf messages during RPC calls; no untrusted data handling or external data sources present.",
  "flows": "Data flows through protobuf serialization/deserialization during RPC calls; no dynamic code execution or external data processing occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. All methods are placeholders raising NotImplementedError, indicating no active logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard generated gRPC boilerplate for a protobuf-defined NLP service. It includes version enforcement but no malicious or suspicious patterns. All server methods are unimplemented, serving as interface stubs. No external data handling, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The serialization functions are standard protobuf methods, and the overall structure is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious, generated gRPC interface with no signs of security vulnerabilities or obfuscation. It enforces version compatibility but does not introduce any security risks. All methods are placeholders, indicating that actual implementation resides elsewhere. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero.",
