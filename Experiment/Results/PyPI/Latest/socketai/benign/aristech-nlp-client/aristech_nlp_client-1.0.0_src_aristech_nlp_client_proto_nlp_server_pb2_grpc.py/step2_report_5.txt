  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk, based on the provided code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is auto-generated gRPC client and server interface code for a protobuf-defined NLP service.\n- Contains version checks for compatibility.\n- All server methods are unimplemented placeholders raising `NotImplementedError`.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code strictly follows standard gRPC patterns and is boilerplate in nature.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Describes standard gRPC boilerplate code.\n- Findings: No anomalies, no malicious logic, no obfuscation.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is straightforward generated code with no security issues. The report's conclusion is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, describing gRPC interface definitions.\n- Findings: No signs of malicious activity; all methods are unimplemented stubs.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, standard boilerplate code. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Defines server stubs with unimplemented methods.\n- Findings: No malicious code, no data leaks, only placeholder methods.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nStandard auto-generated code, safe and benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Similar gRPC interface code with registration functions.\n- Findings: No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo issues detected; it's boilerplate code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: gRPC interface definitions for NLP service.\n- Findings: No malicious code, no obfuscation, minimal security risk (0.1) due to version check.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nWhile the report assigns a small security risk (likely due to version check), it is standard and not malicious. The code does not process untrusted data beyond serialization/deserialization, and no external inputs are mishandled.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious payloads, code injection, or backdoors are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports. The code is straightforward generated boilerplate.\n- **Risk score:** All are very low, mostly 0, with a slight 0.1 in report 5 due to version check, which is standard and not risky.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to version compatibility check, which is benign)\n\n**This code is safe, standard generated gRPC boilerplate, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.**",
