  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as auto-generated protobuf definitions.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- The code is purely declarative, defining data schemas and descriptors.\n- No external input handling, network activity, or runtime behaviors that could be exploited are present.\n- The code is standard protobuf-generated code, which is common in many systems for data serialization.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code:** No issues are present. The code is standard protobuf generated code with no anomalies.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risks:** All reports correctly identify malware and obfuscated code scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code does not process untrusted data or perform risky operations.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; the code is straightforward, generated code, not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified, as there are no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n- The detailed analysis supports that this code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the analysis, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, generated code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Note:** These scores reflect the code's purpose as a standard protobuf schema definition, with no malicious or suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No modifications to the scores are necessary. This is a typical, benign auto-generated protobuf module used for data serialization in a larger system.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Confirm the scores as they are—malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
