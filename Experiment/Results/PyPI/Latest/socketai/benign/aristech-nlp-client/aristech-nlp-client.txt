      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup module for an NLP gRPC client, importing protobuf classes and a client class, then exposing them via __all__. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior risk. The existing reports and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard gRPC client with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only issue is a minor typo in a method call, which does not impact security. The overall security risk is very low, and the code can be considered safe for use."

It enforces version compatibility but does not introduce any security risks. All methods are placeholders, indicating that actual implementation resides elsewhere. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero."

The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0, reflecting the code's harmless, generated schema status."
