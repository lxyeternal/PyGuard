{
  "purpose": "Generated protocol buffer code for NLP server communication, defining message structures and service methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'google.protobuf' modules and local protobuf files ('projects_pb2', 'intents_pb2').",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; code primarily defines data structures and service interfaces.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code only sets up message schemas and protobuf descriptors.",
  "anomalies": "Generated code includes a warning not to edit and lacks any obfuscated or suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated protobuf schema code, importing standard protobuf modules and local definitions. It performs runtime version validation and builds message and service descriptors. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No untrusted input handling or network activity is present within this code snippet. The code serves as a schema definition and is typical of protobuf-generated files, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard, auto-generated protobuf code defining messages and services for an NLP server. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security issues. The structure and content are typical for such generated files, posing no security threat.",
