  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that this code is auto-generated protobuf schema code, primarily responsible for defining message structures and RPC services for an NLP server.\n- No untrusted data processing, network communication, or runtime logic beyond schema setup is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The code is static, relies on standard protobuf modules, and is typical of generated files.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious code or backdoors:** None detected. The code is purely schema definition with no embedded executable logic or network activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation or unusual code patterns.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; the code is standard for protobuf definitions.\n- **Risk and malware scores:** All reports assign very low or zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, generated by protobuf compiler.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk identified, as this is schema code, not runtime logic.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n\n- The reports seem consistent and well-reasoned. The scores are appropriate given the static, schema-only nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is benign, auto-generated protobuf schema definitions.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The detailed reasoning in each report is accurate and aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or embedded payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, generated code.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk in static schema definitions.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis supply chain component is a standard, benign protobuf schema file with no security concerns.",
