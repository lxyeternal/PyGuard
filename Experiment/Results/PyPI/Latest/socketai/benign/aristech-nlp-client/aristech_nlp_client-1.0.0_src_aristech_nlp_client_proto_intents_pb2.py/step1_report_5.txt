{
  "purpose": "Generated protocol buffer code for defining message schemas related to intents, content, and scoring in an NLP system.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.protobuf library, protobuf serialized file data, and descriptor building functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or perform data leakage; no network or file I/O is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only initializes descriptors and message schemas.",
  "anomalies": "Code is auto-generated protobuf schema; no suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. The comment explicitly states 'DO NOT EDIT'.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated by the protobuf compiler and contains message schema definitions for intents and related data structures. It includes import statements, protobuf version validation, descriptor registration, and message building steps. No dynamic code execution, network access, or suspicious logic is present. The code's structure and content align with standard protobuf code generation practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard auto-generated protobuf schema definition with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The code is purely schema-related and does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other potentially risky operations.",
