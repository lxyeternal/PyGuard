{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up imports and exports for a Python package related to NLP and protobuf services.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules and protobuf generated files",
  "sinks": "None directly visible; no data processing, network operations, or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from input sources to sinks; primarily module imports and symbol exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected; straightforward import and export structure",
  "analysis": "The code imports several local modules and protobuf generated files, then defines __all__ for module exports. No code execution, data handling, or network operations are present. It functions solely to organize module namespace. No malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a Python package with protobuf dependencies. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
