{
  "purpose": "This module imports protobuf message and service classes along with a client class for an NLP gRPC client, then exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client) and generated protobuf files (.proto.*)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or network activity present",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ list; no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from protobuf-generated modules and a client class, with an __all__ list defining exported symbols. There is no dynamic execution, data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup module for an NLP gRPC client, importing protobuf classes and a client class, then exposing them via __all__. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior risk. The existing reports and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
