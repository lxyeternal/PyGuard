{
  "purpose": "This code is a module that imports various gRPC protocol buffer classes and a client class for NLP-related functionalities, and defines an export list for these components.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.client, .proto.*) that load protobuf classes and a client class.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no network, file, or environment variable operations are performed in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow involves importing protobuf message classes and the client class for further use, but no data processing or untrusted input handling is evident here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. All imported modules are standard for gRPC protobuf use.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard imports of protobuf-generated classes and a client class for an NLP service, then defines an export list. There are no dynamic executions, obfuscated elements, or suspicious patterns. It appears to be a straightforward setup file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module initialization script for an NLP gRPC client, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports and exports relevant classes for use elsewhere.",
