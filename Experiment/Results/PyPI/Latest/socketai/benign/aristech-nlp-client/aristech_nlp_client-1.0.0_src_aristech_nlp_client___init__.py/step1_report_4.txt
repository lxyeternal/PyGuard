{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports classes and functions from various protobuf-generated files for an NLP-related project, and defines an __all__ list for exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client) and protobuf-generated modules (.proto.*)",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data is being written to external systems, network, or files within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and then exposes them via __all__; there are no data flows, input/output, or execution flows in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code constructs, or suspicious patterns are present. The code consists solely of imports and an export list.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly imports various protobuf-generated classes and a client class, then declares an __all__ list to define module exports. There are no runtime behaviors, no data processing, no user input handling, nor any code that would suggest malicious activity or security risks. Since it is purely import/export setup, it does not perform any actions that could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup for exporting imported classes and functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks present in this snippet.",
