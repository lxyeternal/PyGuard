  "purpose": "The code executes shell commands to extract and print strings from a file named './flag'.",
  "sources": "os.system calls executing 'strings ./flag' command twice.",
  "sinks": "os.system execution of a command that reads and outputs data from a file.",
  "flows": "The code reads data from './flag' via 'strings' command and outputs the result to the console.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant execution of the same command; usage of os.system for command execution which may be insecure; no input validation or sanitization; no apparent malicious intent, but the repeated command suggests possible debugging or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script runs 'strings ./flag' twice, capturing the output in 'print_result' and then printing it. The use of os.system to run system commands is potentially risky if inputs are untrusted, but here it runs a fixed command. The redundancy might indicate debugging, but there's no evidence of malicious payload or obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply extracts and displays strings from a file named './flag' using system commands. There is no direct malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration observed. The use of os.system is a minor security concern but not malicious in this context.",
