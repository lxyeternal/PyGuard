  "purpose": "Extracts and prints string data from the file './flag' using the 'strings' command executed via os.system.",
  "sources": "The command 'strings ./flag' executed twice; no external input is processed.",
  "sinks": "The output of the 'strings' command is not captured; only the exit status is printed.",
  "flows": "os.system('strings ./flag') -> returns exit status; print(print_result) outputs exit status.",
  "anomalies": "The command runs twice without capturing or displaying its output; redundant execution; no input validation; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code executes a static shell command twice, capturing only the exit status, not the command output. No user input or untrusted data is involved. The repeated execution is inefficient but benign. The command may leak sensitive data if 'flag' contains secrets, but no malicious activity or backdoors are present. The use of os.system with static commands poses minimal security risk, mainly related to potential data leakage or insecure practices. No obfuscation or malware is detected. The overall security risk is low, approximately 0.2, and malware is absent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, executing a simple command twice with no malicious intent. The main concern is the insecure use of os.system and potential data leakage if 'flag' contains sensitive info. Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.",
