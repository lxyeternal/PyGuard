  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python package module, potentially intended for data processing or utility functions. Its exact purpose cannot be fully determined from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external modules or network calls (if present).",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to return statements, writes to files, or network connections (if any are present).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters, env vars) through processing functions to sinks such as output or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are identified. The code structure appears standard, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs evident.",
  "analysis": "The code does not include any suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network communications to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or code injection mechanisms. It uses standard Python features and third-party libraries without unusual patterns. Without additional context or network activity, no malicious intent is detected. The code appears to be a typical utility or data processing module, with no evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign and consistent with normal Python module practices.",
