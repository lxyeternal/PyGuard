  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, user input, network or file I/O, dynamic code execution functions like eval()/exec(), hardcoded secrets or IPs.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, environment variables, subprocess calls, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into functions like eval()/exec() or network modules, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, hardcoded credentials/IPs, signs of obfuscation, opaque logic, dynamic imports, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high suspicion when dynamic execution functions and hardcoded secrets are used, indicating malicious intent. Obfuscation signs further increase risk. Benign patterns lack such indicators. The scores assigned reflect these observations, with high malware (0.75-0.8) and obfuscation (0.6-0.7) scores justified by malicious indicators. Low scores are appropriate for benign or absent code. The reasoning aligns with standard security assessment practices.",
  "conclusion": "Report 3 demonstrates likely malicious behavior with high malware and obfuscation scores, justified by dynamic code execution and hardcoded secrets. Other reports are benign or inconclusive, with scores consistent with their analysis. Overall, the scoring is appropriate and justified.",
