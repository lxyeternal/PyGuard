  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard, with no malicious behavior detected. The only concern is the description string 'for rce', which could be misleading but does not constitute an actual security threat. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score is slightly elevated (~0.2 to 0.3) due to the misleading description. Clarifying or removing this description would improve clarity."
