  "sources": "Reading README file, static package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external commands executed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static metadata only.",
  "anomalies": "Description string 'for rce' is unusual and potentially misleading.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious code. The only notable element is the description 'for rce', which is suspicious as it references remote code execution but is used as a static string. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (around 0.2). The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty that no malicious activity exists. The description's wording could mislead users but does not execute or facilitate malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard, with no malicious behavior detected. The only concern is the description string 'for rce', which could be misleading but does not constitute an actual security threat. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score is slightly elevated (~0.2 to 0.3) due to the misleading description. Clarifying or removing this description would improve clarity.",
