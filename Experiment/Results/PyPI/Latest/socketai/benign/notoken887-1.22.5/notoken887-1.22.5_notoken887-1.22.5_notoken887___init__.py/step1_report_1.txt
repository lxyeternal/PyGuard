  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the absence of visible code content. It may be part of a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "The code does not show explicit input reading or data sources. Potential sources could include environment variables, function parameters, or external APIs if present in unseen portions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are evident in the visible code, such as network connections, file writes, or command executions.",
  "flows": "No clear data flows from sources to sinks are observable without additional context or code sections.",
  "anomalies": "The provided code snippet is empty, which is unusual. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present. Lack of visible code may indicate incomplete or intentionally minimal implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is empty, providing no functional or behavioral information. Without actual code, it is impossible to identify malicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or anomalous behavior. The absence of content may be benign or could suggest the code was omitted. Further context or the complete code is needed for a proper review.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided empty code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. However, the lack of content prevents a definitive assessment. Additional code or context is necessary for a thorough review.",
