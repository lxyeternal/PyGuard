  "purpose": "Simple substitution cipher for transforming a string by replacing 'M' with '4' and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The input string 'text_string' assigned with a test string containing 'M'.",
  "sinks": "The print statements outputting the encrypted and decrypted tokens; no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> encrypt method -> replace 'M' with '4' -> output encrypted string -> decrypt method -> replace '4' with 'M' -> output decrypted string.",
  "anomalies": "The encryption method performs a basic string replacement without any cryptographic security; no secrets or credentials are handled. No obfuscated or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for simple text substitution, replacing 'M' with '4' and vice versa. It demonstrates straightforward usage with a sample string. There are no indications of data exfiltration, malicious backdoors, or complex operations. No external data sources, no unsafe code or environment variables, and no network activity. The logic is trivial and benign, intended for simple transformation, not security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic string manipulation class with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to serve as a simple example or utility for string replacement. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
