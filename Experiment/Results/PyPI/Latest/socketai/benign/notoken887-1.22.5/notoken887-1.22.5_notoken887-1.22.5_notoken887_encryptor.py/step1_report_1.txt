{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple class for replacing characters in a string to 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' text by substituting 'M' with '4' and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The input data is the string 'text_string' initialized with a fixed message. The class methods accept strings as input for encryption and decryption.",
  "sinks": "The outputs are printed to the console. There are no external data transmissions, file writes, or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input string -> encrypt method -> replace 'M' with '4' -> encrypted string -> decrypt method -> replace '4' with 'M' -> decrypted string -> print output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code constructs. The replacement logic is trivial and does not involve any security-sensitive operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic string replacements for 'encryption' and 'decryption'. No input validation or security mechanisms are involved. There is no data leakage, network communication, or obfuscation. The methods only operate on strings in memory, with no external dependencies or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious string manipulation class with no signs of malware or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration. Overall, it appears benign.",
