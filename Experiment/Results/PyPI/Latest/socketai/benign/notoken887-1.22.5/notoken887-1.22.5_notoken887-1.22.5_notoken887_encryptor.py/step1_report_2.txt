{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple class for encrypting and decrypting strings by replacing specific characters.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via the 'token' parameter in the encrypt method and the 'encrypted_token' in the decrypt method.",
  "sinks": "Print statements output the processed strings; no external or untrusted sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Input string -> encrypt method (replaces 'M' with '4') -> output encrypted string -> decrypt method (replaces '4' with 'M') -> output decrypted string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious behavior, and no unusual code patterns. The replacement logic is trivial and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a straightforward string transformation with no external data access, no network communication, and no manipulation of sensitive data. The code appears benign, performing simple character substitution without side effects or malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code execution pathways. The print statements only output processed strings; no data leaks or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs basic string substitution. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
