{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple class for substituting characters in a string, specifically replacing 'M' with '4' and vice versa, likely for basic obfuscation or encoding purposes.",
  "sources": "Input source is the variable 'text_string' assigned with a static string; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "Output functions 'print' display the encrypted and decrypted strings; no data leakage or untrusted data output identified.",
  "flows": "The input string is processed by 'encrypt' method (replacing 'M' with '4'), then the output is processed by 'decrypt' (replacing '4' back with 'M'), with results printed to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no malicious code, no obfuscated logic, and no suspicious behavior. The operations are simple string replacements with no external calls or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward string substitution, which is a benign operation. No external data sources, network calls, or file manipulations are present. The code appears to serve as a basic example of character replacement. No anomalies, malicious code, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple string substitution class with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain malicious payloads. Overall, it appears safe and non-malicious.",
