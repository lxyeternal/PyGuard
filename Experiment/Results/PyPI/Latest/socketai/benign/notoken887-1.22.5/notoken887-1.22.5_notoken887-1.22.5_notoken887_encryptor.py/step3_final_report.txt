  "purpose": "Simple string replacement class performing 'M' to '4' substitution and vice versa, likely for demonstration or trivial obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Input string 'text_string' used in encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> encrypt method -> replace 'M' with '4' -> output encrypted string -> decrypt method -> replace '4' with 'M' -> output decrypted string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with simple string replacement methods. It processes a static input string, performing trivial substitutions without external dependencies or security-sensitive operations. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The logic is transparent and benign, serving as a basic demonstration of string manipulation. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate a very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing trivial string replacements with no malicious intent or security issues. All signals point to a safe, straightforward utility. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
