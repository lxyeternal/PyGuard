{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple substitution cipher for strings, replacing 'M' with '4' and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The input string 'token' passed to the encrypt method; the 'encrypted_token' variable after encryption.",
  "sinks": "The printed output of encrypted and decrypted tokens.",
  "flows": "Input string -> encrypt() method (replaces 'M' with '4') -> printed encrypted token -> decrypt() method (replaces '4' with 'M') -> printed decrypted token.",
  "anomalies": "The encryption method is extremely simplistic and does not secure data; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. No external data sources or untrusted data handling that could lead to security issues.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a trivial string substitution cipher, replacing 'M' with '4' during encryption and reversing this during decryption. The code is straightforward, with no external data inputs other than the input string, and no data leaks or malicious actions. The print statements are for demonstration. There are no obfuscated parts or malicious behaviors. The code appears to serve as a basic example or placeholder for more complex encryption logic. There are no security risks, malware, or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple, non-secure string replacement and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely a demonstration or placeholder rather than an actual secure encryption implementation.",
