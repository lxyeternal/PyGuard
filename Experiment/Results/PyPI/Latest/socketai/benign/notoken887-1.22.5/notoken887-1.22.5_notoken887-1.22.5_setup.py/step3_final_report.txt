  "purpose": "This setup.py script defines package metadata for distribution, with no dynamic or malicious code.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields: name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static metadata without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org' as unprofessional or provocative metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static, hardcoded metadata. No dynamic data, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The only notable anomalies are the contact email and URL, which are unprofessional but do not constitute security risks. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects metadata concerns but not actual vulnerabilities. The confidence score is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. Overall, the code is benign; the main concern is metadata professionalism.",
  "conclusion": "The package code is safe and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only issues are metadata anomalies (suspicious contact info and URL), which do not impact security but should be reviewed for professionalism. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low security risk score of 0.2.",
