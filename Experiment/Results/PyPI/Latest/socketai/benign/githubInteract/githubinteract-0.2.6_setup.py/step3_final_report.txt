{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'githubInteract' library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; declares dependencies 'github' and 'git'; uses 'find_packages()' and 'setup()' for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution or external data writes; dependencies are declared but not executed.",
  "flows": "Static configuration data flows from code to package metadata; no runtime data flows or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script used for packaging Python projects. It reads a README file, specifies package info, dependencies, and classifiers. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behaviors are present. Dependencies are common packages related to GitHub interaction. The code performs static configuration without dynamic or network activity. All signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code.",
