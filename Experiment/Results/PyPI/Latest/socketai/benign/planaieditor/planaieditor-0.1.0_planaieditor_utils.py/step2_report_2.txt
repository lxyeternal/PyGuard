  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions for static analysis: splitting method signatures, parsing tracebacks, validating class names.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no suspicious code, no external system interaction. Uses regex and string parsing safely.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the benign nature. Security risk is minimal (0.1).\n- **Comments:** The only minor concern is debug print statements, but they don't pose security risks.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with notes on debug print statements that could leak info if logs are exposed.\n- **Findings:** No execution of untrusted code, no external system access. Slight concern about debug prints, but overall safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, consistent. Security risk at 0.1 is reasonable.\n- **Comments:** No malicious logic detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same functions, no suspicious patterns, safe regex parsing.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code execution, no external data handling, no malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, aligned. Security risk 0.2 is slightly higher but still low, perhaps due to debug info leakage potential.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates safe parsing, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malware, no dangerous data flow.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for static analysis, safe regex, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No malicious patterns, no external system interaction.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports agree the code is benign.\n- **Errors or flaws:** Minor debug print statements, but not security issues.\n- **Scores justification:**\n  - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n  - **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero, reflecting minimal potential info leakage via debug prints, but overall very low.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, mostly related to debug info leakage potential.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is purely static analysis utilities with no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThis reflects a safe, benign utility module with negligible security concerns.",
