{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for analyzing Python source code and parsing tracebacks, likely for debugging or static analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Input source code strings for method signatures and traceback strings.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write to files, send data over networks, or execute untrusted code. The functions parse strings and perform regex matching, which are safe operations.",
  "flows": "The code reads source code and traceback strings, processes them internally using regex and string operations, without passing data to external systems or executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains debug print statements in exception handling (`print(f\"Info: Splitting failed: {e}\")`) which could potentially leak internal error details if logs are exposed. The method for splitting signatures relies solely on regex and string operations, which are safe but may be error-prone for complex or maliciously crafted source code. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic are detected.",
  "analysis": "The functions primarily perform static string parsing: 'split_method_signature_body' attempts to extract method signatures and bodies from source code, using regex and line-by-line analysis. 'parse_traceback' extracts class names and error messages from traceback strings. There is no dynamic code execution, network access, or system modification. The debug print statements could be a minor information leak but do not pose security threats. No malware patterns or malicious behaviors are evident; the code is designed for analysis and parsing only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs static parsing tasks for source code and tracebacks without any malicious intent or malicious code. It has no observable malware behavior or security risks. The only minor concern is debug printing, which does not affect security but could leak info if logs are exposed.",
