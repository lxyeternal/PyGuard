{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for analyzing Python source code, including splitting method signatures, parsing tracebacks, and validating class names.",
  "sources": "Reading source code strings and traceback strings; regex pattern matching for parsing signatures and tracebacks.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly write to external systems, files, or network; they primarily process and return data.",
  "flows": "Input source code or traceback strings are parsed to extract structured data, with no untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The code relies on regex for parsing but does not execute or evaluate external code dynamically.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for static analysis and parsing of Python source code and tracebacks. It includes functions for validating class names, splitting method signatures, and parsing tracebacks to identify error context. It uses regex for pattern matching, which appears standard and safe. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious data handling is evident. The functions do not perform network operations, system modifications, or sensitive data collection. Overall, the code appears to serve as a utility module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility script intended for parsing and analyzing Python source code and tracebacks. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The logic and methods used are standard for static code analysis and error parsing.",
