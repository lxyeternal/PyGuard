  "purpose": "Utility functions for static analysis: validating class names, splitting method signatures, and parsing tracebacks.",
  "sources": "Regex-based parsing of method signatures and traceback strings; input data includes source code snippets and traceback logs.",
  "sinks": "None; functions do not process untrusted data in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input source code or traceback strings are parsed via regex and string operations; no external or untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of debug print statements in exception handling which could leak internal info if logs are exposed, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code employs regex and string parsing to analyze Python source code and traceback strings. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The functions are straightforward, with fallback mechanisms for parsing failures. Debug print statements exist but are typical for debugging and do not pose security risks. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for static analysis of Python code and tracebacks. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor debug print statements do not significantly impact security. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal potential info leakage. The assessments across all reports are consistent and justified.",
