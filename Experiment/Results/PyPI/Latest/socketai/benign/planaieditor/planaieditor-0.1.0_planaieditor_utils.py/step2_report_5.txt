  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily utility functions for static analysis: parsing method signatures, tracebacks, and validating class names.\n- No evidence of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- Use of regex and string processing for parsing is standard and safe.\n- Minor concern: debug print statements in exception handling could leak internal info if logs are exposed, but this is a common debugging practice and not inherently malicious.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code functions as intended for static analysis.\n- No issues are present in the code logic that suggest malicious intent.\n- The parsing methods are straightforward, with fallback mechanisms in case of failure.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The only minor flaw is the presence of `print` statements in exception handling (`print(f\"Info: Splitting failed: {e}\")`). These could leak internal error details if logs are exposed, but they do not introduce security risks.\n- The regex-based parsing might be brittle against intentionally malformed or malicious code snippets, but this is expected in static analysis tools and not a security concern per se.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is consistent. No malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern. Given the benign nature, a score of around 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n### Potential Over- or Under-Scoring:\n- The scores seem reasonable. No report assigns a high risk or malware score, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The minor debug print statements do not justify increasing the risk score significantly.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Based on the detailed analysis, I would assign the following scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — Code is straightforward, not obfuscated.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1** — Very low; primarily static analysis utilities with minimal potential for leakage if logs are exposed.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, benign, and suitable for static analysis purposes.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric            | Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0.0     | No malicious code or behavior detected                     |\n| Obfuscated        | 0.0     | Clear, straightforward code                                |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1     | Minor info leak via debug prints, but no real security threat |\n\n**Final note:** The provided reports are consistent with this assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign utility functions with no malicious intent.",
