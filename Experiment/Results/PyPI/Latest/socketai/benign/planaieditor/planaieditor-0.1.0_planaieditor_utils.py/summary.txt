  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for static analysis of Python code and tracebacks. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor debug print statements do not significantly impact security. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal potential info leakage. The assessments across all reports are consistent and justified."
