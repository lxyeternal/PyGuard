      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate development tool designed for code validation, inspection, and debugging. It executes user code in subprocesses without sandboxing, which introduces significant security risks if inputs are malicious. No evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage is present. The primary concern is the potential for code injection and execution in untrusted environments. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate: malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a security risk around 0.6 due to the inherent risks of dynamic code execution without sandboxing."

The minor debug print statements do not significantly impact security. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal potential info leakage. The assessments across all reports are consistent and justified."
