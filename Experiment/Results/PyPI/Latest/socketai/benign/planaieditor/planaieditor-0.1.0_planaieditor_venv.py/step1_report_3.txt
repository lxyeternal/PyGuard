  "purpose": "Discover available Python interpreter environments on the system by locating virtual environments and system interpreters.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath(__file__), sys.executable, sys.platform, Path.home(), directory listings with Path.glob and Path.iterdir()",
  "sinks": "os.path.isfile(), os.access(), appending paths to the environments list, converting Path objects to strings",
  "flows": "Reading system paths and directories (sources) leading to the collection of paths for Python interpreters (sinks), used to generate a list of environments",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code structures, or suspicious logic; the code solely discovers system paths and interpreters with no external data input handling or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code systematically searches for Python virtual environments across various common directories and paths, based on platform. It checks the existence and executability of potential interpreter files and compiles a list of environments. No external data input is processed, and no untrusted data flows into insecure sinks. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors. The code’s purpose appears purely to discover interpreters, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment discovery script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply enumerates potential Python interpreters on the system without executing untrusted code or leaking data.",
