  "purpose": "Discover Python interpreter environments available on the system by locating virtual environments and system interpreters.",
  "sources": "File system directories (via Path.glob, Path.iterdir, Path.home), environment variables (sys.executable), system platform info (sys.platform).",
  "sinks": "Appending paths to the 'environments' list and checking file existence and executability, which are standard operations without handling untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "Filesystem directory searches → collecting file paths → filtering and deduplicating paths → returning environment list.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code searches specific directories for virtual environment Python interpreters and system interpreters, filters for executable files, and deduplicates the list. It uses standard Python modules and functions with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious intent apparent. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical environment discovery practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign task of discovering Python environments using standard filesystem operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
