  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for environment discovery, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor typo is harmless. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate; a slightly lower security risk score (0) could be justified, but 0.1 is acceptable. Overall, the code poses no security risk or malware concern."
