  "purpose": "Manages subprocesses for a Python language server, handling start, stop, message framing, and stream reading with thread safety.",
  "sources": "Reads from subprocess stdout and stderr streams, and writes to subprocess stdin.",
  "sinks": "Processes incoming JSON messages from stdout; writes formatted JSON messages to stdin.",
  "flows": "Source: subprocess stdout/stderr streams; Sink: socketio_emit for stdout, subprocess stdin for messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard subprocess management with threading for reading stdout/stderr, regex parsing for message headers, JSON framing, and safe process termination. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external network activity are present. Error handling and cleanup routines are appropriate. The code is straightforward, readable, and follows best practices for process control and stream handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured subprocess handler for an LSP server, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero. The overall security assessment is that the code is safe and benign.",
