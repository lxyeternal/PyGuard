{
  "purpose": "This script copies frontend build assets from a source directory to a target static directory within a Python package during build or deployment.",
  "sources": "os.path, pathlib.Path, and shutil functions and methods that read directories, check for existence, and perform filesystem operations.",
  "targets": "Filesystem operations like mkdir, rmtree, and copytree that modify directories and files.",
  "flows": "The script reads directory existence and paths (sources), then potentially deletes and copies files/directories (targets), with no untrusted data input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual variable usage. The print statements are for logging and do not affect execution security.",
  "analysis": "The code performs filesystem checks and copies files from a frontend build directory to a static directory within the package. All paths are constructed relative to the script's location, and no untrusted input influences the operations. The removal and copying of directories are standard build steps. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or unauthorized system access is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward build utility for managing static frontend assets. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe from a cybersecurity perspective, with no signs of malware or malicious activities.",
