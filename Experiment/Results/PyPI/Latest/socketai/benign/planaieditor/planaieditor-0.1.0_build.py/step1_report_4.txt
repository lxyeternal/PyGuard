{
  "purpose": "The script copies frontend build assets from a specified source directory into the package's static directory to prepare for deployment.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file location (__file__), checks existence of directories (frontend build directory), and reads environment via os.getcwd().",
  "sinks": "Uses shutil.rmtree() and shutil.copytree() to delete and copy directories, which are standard filesystem operations.",
  "flows": "Source (__file__, os.getcwd(), directory existence checks) → filesystem operations (rmtree, copytree) as part of copying static assets.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious code, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no network activity or privacy violations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory validation, removes existing static files directory, and copies new frontend assets into the target location. All operations are standard file system manipulations with proper checks. No untrusted input is used in critical operations, and no external network or system commands are invoked. The code appears to serve a build or deployment purpose, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward build utility for copying frontend assets into a package directory. It does not contain malicious code or behaviors. It operates securely within its intended purpose, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
