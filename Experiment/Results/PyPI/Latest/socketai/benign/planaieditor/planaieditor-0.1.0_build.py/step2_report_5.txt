  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script copies frontend build assets from a source directory (`frontend/build`) to a target static directory within the package.\n- It performs directory existence checks, deletes the target directory if it exists, and copies the new assets.\n- All operations are filesystem manipulations based on relative paths.\n- No untrusted input, network activity, or obfuscated code is involved.\n- The script is a typical build utility.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Malware presence:** None detected; the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; the code is clear and readable.\n- **Security risk:** Essentially zero; standard filesystem operations with no external inputs or network activity.\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**  \n- All describe the script as a straightforward build utility for copying static assets.  \n- No suspicious or malicious activity is identified.  \n- The analyses are consistent, emphasizing the absence of malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and standard filesystem operations.\n\n### Scoring justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate; no malware or malicious intent is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a score of 0 or very close to 0 is justified. Some reports assign 0.1, which is acceptable but slightly overestimating risk for such a benign script.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Any potential vulnerabilities or assumptions?**  \n  The script assumes the directory structure is correct and that deleting and copying directories is safe in the build context. However, these are standard practices and do not introduce security issues unless misused.\n\n- **Any signs of malicious intent?**  \n  No. The code performs only filesystem operations with no external inputs or network activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Note:** The slight variation in some reports (0.1) for security risk is acceptable but slightly overstates the actual risk level.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard build utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reported analyses are accurate and consistent with the code's intent and behavior.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code's benign nature.",
