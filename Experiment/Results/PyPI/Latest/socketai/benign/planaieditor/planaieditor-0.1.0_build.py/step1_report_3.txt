  "purpose": "This script copies frontend build assets from a specified source directory into a target static directory within a Python package, to include frontend assets in the package distribution.",
  "sources": "The source directory for frontend build assets (frontend_build_dir) determined from the filesystem path.",
  "sinks": "The shutil.copytree() function copies files from the source to the target directory; no external untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "The script reads the directory paths (frontend_build_dir and target_static_dir), verifies the existence of the source directory, potentially deletes the target directory, and copies the entire frontend build directory to the target location.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code behavior. The script performs standard filesystem operations with no obfuscated or suspicious code structures. No external network or data exfiltration is present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes paths based on the script's location, ensures the target directory exists, and copies frontend build files if the source directory exists. It includes print statements for logging and handles missing source directory gracefully. No user input, external data, or environment variables are used in a potentially unsafe or malicious manner. No indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The operations are standard file management tasks for packaging frontend assets.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard filesystem copying of frontend assets into a package directory, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign build utility.",
