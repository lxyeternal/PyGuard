  "purpose": "To copy frontend build assets from a specified source directory to a target static directory within a Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file location (__file__), directory existence checks, and directory paths for copying files.",
  "sinks": "Uses shutil.rmtree and shutil.copytree for directory removal and copying, which operate on filesystem paths.",
  "flows": "From identifying the frontend build directory to removing existing target directory and copying new assets.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. The code performs straightforward filesystem operations with proper existence checks.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by determining directory paths based on the current file location. It prints debug information about directories. It ensures the parent directory of the target static directory exists. If the frontend build directory exists, it deletes any existing target directory and copies the frontend build files into the target location. If the frontend build directory does not exist, it issues a warning. All operations are standard filesystem manipulations with no suspicious or malicious activity, and no untrusted input handling or external network communication is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical build step for static assets, copying frontend build files into the backend package directory. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
