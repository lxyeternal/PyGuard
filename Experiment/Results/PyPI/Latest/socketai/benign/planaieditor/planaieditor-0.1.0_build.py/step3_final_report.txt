  "purpose": "Copy frontend build assets from the source directory to the package static directory during build/deployment.",
  "sources": "Path definitions based on script location, reading directory existence and structure.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem operations such as directory removal and copying.",
  "flows": "Check if frontend build directory exists -> remove existing static directory -> copy new build assets.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; straightforward filesystem operations.",
  "analysis": "The script determines source and target directories relative to its location, checks for the existence of the frontend build directory, deletes the existing static directory if present, and copies the new build assets. It performs standard build steps with no external input, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is simple, purpose-specific, and does not contain any malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The filesystem operations are safe within a controlled build environment. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign build utility for copying frontend assets. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low risk score are appropriate and justified.",
