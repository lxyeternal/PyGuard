  "purpose": "This script copies frontend build assets from a source directory to a target static directory within a Python package during the build process.",
  "sources": "Reads from the frontend build directory (frontend/build) and the current file location (__file__).",
  "sinks": "Uses shutil.rmtree() and shutil.copytree() to delete and copy directories, affecting the filesystem.",
  "flows": "Checks for the existence of the frontend build directory; if found, deletes the target directory and copies new files from source to target.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network activity, and no suspicious file operations beyond standard filesystem manipulation. The code is straightforward and purpose-specific.",
  "analysis": "The script determines the source and target directories based on the current script's location. It verifies if the frontend build directory exists, removes the existing target directory if present, and copies the new build assets. It logs actions but does not process or execute untrusted data. The operations are typical for build or deployment scripts. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected; the code simply manages static assets during a build process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build helper script for copying frontend assets into a Python package. It performs filesystem operations securely without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security risks are identified.",
