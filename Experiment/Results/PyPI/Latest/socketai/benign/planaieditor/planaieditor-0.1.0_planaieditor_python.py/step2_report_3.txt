  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a code generator for a graph-based PlanAI system, with no malicious activity detected. It uses standard validation, string formatting, and code templating. The malware score is 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a typical code generator with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The use of dynamic code generation is common in such tools but does pose risks if input data is untrusted. However, no malicious payloads are evident.\n\n- **Verdict:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The overall risk is low (0.2), which aligns with the report's conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing systematic code generation, class creation, dependencies, and error handling. No malicious activity or suspicious external calls detected. The malware score remains 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The detailed analysis confirms that the code is a legitimate code generator with standard practices. No malicious patterns or backdoors are present.\n\n- **Verdict:** Malware score of 0 is justified. The risk score (0.2) remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on code that generates modules with class definitions, instantiations, dependency setup, and error handling. No malicious behavior or external network activity detected. Uses 'black' for formatting and string templates.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly states that the code is a typical code generator with no signs of malicious intent. The dynamic code generation via string templates is standard but should be handled cautiously.\n\n- **Verdict:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate. The overall security risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code generates Python modules from graph data, with class definitions, dependency setup, and error handling. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious external calls are detected. The code relies on string concatenation and 'black' formatting.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion that the code is a legitimate code generator with no malicious behavior is consistent with the code's structure. The potential risk is in handling untrusted input, but no malicious patterns are evident.\n\n- **Verdict:** Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing that the code constructs classes, dependencies, and initial tasks without malicious activity. No code injection or remote code execution observed.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's behavior. The reliance on string formatting and code snippets is typical, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Verdict:** Malware score remains 0, risk is low.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code analysis. The code is a code generator that dynamically creates Python code based on input data, but no malicious payloads or behaviors are evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is transparent and well-structured.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are around 0.2, reflecting the inherent risks of dynamic code generation from untrusted input, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (Code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** (Standard risks associated with code generation from external data)\n\n**Note:** The primary security concern in such systems is handling untrusted input data. Proper validation and sandboxing are recommended to mitigate risks. But based on the provided code and reports, there is no evidence of malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured code generator for a graph-based task system. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected. The current scores are appropriate.",
