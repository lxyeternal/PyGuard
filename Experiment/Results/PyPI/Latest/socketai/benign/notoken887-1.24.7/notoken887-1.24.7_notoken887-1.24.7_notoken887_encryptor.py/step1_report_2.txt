{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encrypt and decrypt strings using a character substitution cipher with additional formatting (inserting '▓' after each character).",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to the encrypt or decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks, system commands, or external communications.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through reversal and character substitution, with insertion/removal of '▓' as a formatting step; no external data flow or system interaction observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs simple character substitution with no external dependencies, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated or dynamic code execution. It does not contain suspicious or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward encoding/decoding mechanism that reverses strings, substitutes characters with emojis or symbols, and formats the output by inserting '▓'. The decryption reverses these steps. There are no system calls, network operations, or data leaks present. The code appears intentionally simple and benign, serving purely as a cipher.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character substitution cipher implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or external data exfiltration mechanisms. Its security risk score is low, and confidence is high that the code is harmless.",
