{
  "purpose": "Reversible string obfuscation and encoding using character substitution with emojis and string reversal, with added separator characters for obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Input string provided to encrypt/decrypt methods; internal character replacements.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks, network calls, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input string -> reverse -> character substitution -> insert separator ('▓') -> output; for decryption: remove separator -> reverse -> character substitution back to original.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fixed character mappings and insertion of separator characters ('▓') for obfuscation; no dynamic code or obfuscation beyond simple substitution and reversal.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward reversible transformations: reversing strings, substituting characters with emojis, and inserting separator characters. No external system interactions, network activity, or malicious code patterns are present. The substitution mappings are fixed and reversible, indicating benign encoding or obfuscation. The separator insertion appears solely for formatting or superficial obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The obfuscation layer is minimal, and the overall security risk is negligible. The code's purpose is purely for reversible encoding, with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign reversible obfuscation utility employing character substitution and string reversal. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
