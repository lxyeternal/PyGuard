{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple reversible encoding and decoding (encryption and decryption) of strings using character replacement and reversing techniques.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via the 'encrypt' method parameter 'string' and the 'decrypt' method parameter 'encrypted_token'.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally within the methods; no direct data leakage or system interaction occurs. No external system calls or sensitive data access are present.",
  "flows": "Input string is reversed and character replacements are applied in 'encrypt'; the processed string is then interleaved with '▓' characters. In 'decrypt', the process is reversed by removing '▓' and reversing again, then replacing emoji back to characters.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs character substitutions and string reversals but contains no obvious malicious behavior or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious operations are present. The method is a simple reversible cipher, not secure encryption.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a straightforward reversible transformation using character replacement and string reversal. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. The encoding is simple and obfuscated but not cryptographically secure. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data theft, system damage, or covert communication. The use of emoji replacements and insertion of '▓' is benign but could be used to obfuscate data; however, it does not constitute malicious activity by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple reversible encoding/decoding mechanism with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve as a lightweight obfuscation technique rather than a security feature. No malware or malicious intent is evident.",
