{
  "purpose": "The class provides a simple encoding and decoding mechanism that transforms input strings into a custom emoji-based representation and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encrypt() and encrypted tokens supplied to decrypt().",
  "sinks": "Return values of encrypt() and decrypt() methods; these outputs could potentially be used or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input strings are reversed and characters replaced with emojis during encryption; emojis are re-mapped back to original characters during decryption, with reversible transformations and insertion/removal of '▓' delimiters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code does not perform network communication, file access, or system modification. The emoji substitution scheme is a simple reversible cipher without any external dependencies or obfuscated code. No suspicious dynamic execution, or suspicious data handling is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a reversible encoding scheme using emoji substitutions. It reverses the input string, replaces characters with emojis, and inserts delimiter characters. The decryption process reverses these steps. The logic appears straightforward and primarily for obfuscation or aesthetic purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors. It is a basic cipher mechanism with no external effects or security risks. The code is clean, structured, and uses standard string operations. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The class is a benign reversible encoding scheme without malicious intent. It appears to be designed for data obfuscation or simple encryption. There are no security threats, malware, or malicious behaviors detected. The overall security risk score is very low.",
