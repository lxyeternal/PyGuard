{
  "purpose": "To provide a reversible encoding and decoding mechanism for strings using character replacements and a custom marker, likely for obfuscation or simple data transformation.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter in encrypt method; encrypted_token parameter in decrypt method.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code performs in-memory string transformations without external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input string -> reverse -> replace characters -> insert marker -> output encrypted string; Encrypted string -> remove markers -> reverse -> replace characters -> output original string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code activities observed. The character substitution is straightforward, with no unusual logic or external dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple reversible substitution cipher with added markers for obfuscation. Both encrypt and decrypt methods follow symmetrical processes involving reversing strings, character replacements, and insertion/removal of a separator. The code is structurally clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. It appears to be a basic encoding utility, not malicious or maliciously designed. No external calls, network operations, or sensitive data handling are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward reversible string obfuscation utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. The purpose seems benign and aligned with simple data encoding.",
