{
  "purpose": "The code is a simple Python script with no external input, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static code with no data flows.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code is static and benign.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, boilerplate script with no suspicious functions, data flows, or external interactions. It does not utilize dangerous functions like eval() or subprocess with shell=True. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The absence of external inputs and sinks further reduces risk. The overall pattern indicates a benign, standard script with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate given the simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.",
