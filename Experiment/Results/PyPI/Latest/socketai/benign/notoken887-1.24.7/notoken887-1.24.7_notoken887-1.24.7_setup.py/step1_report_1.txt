  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'notoken887' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads static metadata fields such as name, version, author, description, url, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; no user input or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Author email uses a provocative email address, but this is likely a placeholder or intentional choice; no hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; no obfuscation or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python library. It contains package metadata such as name, version, author info, description, and URL. There are no data inputs, external data processing, or dynamic behaviors. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present. The email address used is unusual but not malicious, and no external code execution or data leaks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign package definition.",
