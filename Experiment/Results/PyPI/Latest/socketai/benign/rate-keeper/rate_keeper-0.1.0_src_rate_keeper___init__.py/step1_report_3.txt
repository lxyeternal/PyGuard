{
  "purpose": "This code module re-exports classes and functions from the 'rate_keeper' module for external use, likely to manage rate limiting or timing functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.rate_keeper' (RateKeeper, clock)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no external network, file, or sensitive data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely defining exports without data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; simple re-exporting",
  "analysis": "The code imports two elements from a local module and defines an __all__ list for explicit export. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. It appears to be standard Python module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module re-export with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It serves to make 'RateKeeper' and 'clock' available for import elsewhere.",
