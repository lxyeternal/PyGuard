{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define the public interface for a module by importing and exposing 'RateKeeper' and 'clock' from a submodule 'rate_keeper'.",
  "sources": "Imports 'RateKeeper' and 'clock' from a local module '.rate_keeper'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely performs imports and defines '__all__'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two entities from a local module and exposes them via '__all__' for public use. There are no inputs, no data processing, no network or file operations, and no potential for malicious behavior. The simplicity suggests standard module export behavior. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module initializer that exposes specific components. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
