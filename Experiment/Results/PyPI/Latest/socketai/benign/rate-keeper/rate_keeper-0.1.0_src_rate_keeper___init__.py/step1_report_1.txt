{
  "purpose": "Re-exports the RateKeeper class and clock function from a local module named rate_keeper for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module .rate_keeper",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sources or sinks identified",
  "flows": "None; this code only re-exports symbols without processing data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or hardcoded secrets detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific symbols from a local module and defines __all__ for explicit exports. There are no data processing, external input, or network operations. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code appears to be standard module export syntax, and the imported module is not visible here but is assumed to be legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module re-export with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not perform any data handling or sensitive operations.",
