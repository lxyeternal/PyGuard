  "purpose": "Re-exporting RateKeeper and clock from the local rate_keeper module for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from .rate_keeper module",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external sources or sinks",
  "flows": "None; purely re-exporting symbols without data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports two symbols from a local module and defines __all__ for export. It involves no data processing, external inputs, network, or file operations. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module re-export with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
