{
  "purpose": "Constructs file paths to specific Excel files relative to the script's directory for resource access.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current script's file path via __file__ and constructs Path objects for specific filenames within that directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only sets up file path references without executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Source is __file__, flow is constructing Path objects pointing to fixed filenames within the script's directory.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path, defines a base directory relative to __file__, and creates Path objects for specific Excel files. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is simple, benign, and intended for resource referencing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's behavior. The confidence level is high (1.0), and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a resource locator for local files. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
