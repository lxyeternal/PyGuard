  "purpose": "Defines file paths to specific Excel catalog files relative to the current script's directory.",
  "sources": "The script reads its own file location (__file__) to determine the directory path.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only constructs file paths based on its own location.",
  "flows": "Path construction from __file__ to specific Excel files; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code simply constructs file paths.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path from pathlib, then sets _CATALOG to the directory containing the current script. It then constructs three Path objects pointing to specific Excel files in the same directory. There are no external inputs, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to be a straightforward setup for file referencing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign; it simply sets up file paths relative to the script's location without any malicious intent or security risks.",
