  "purpose": "Defines file paths to rules catalog Excel files relative to the script location.",
  "sources": "Uses __file__ to determine the directory of the current script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or data manipulation.",
  "flows": "Path(__file__).parent is used to construct paths to specific files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Uses standard library features appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pathlib.Path, defines a base directory based on the script location, and constructs paths to three Excel files. No user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution occurs. The code appears to simply set up file paths for later use. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup of file paths without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
