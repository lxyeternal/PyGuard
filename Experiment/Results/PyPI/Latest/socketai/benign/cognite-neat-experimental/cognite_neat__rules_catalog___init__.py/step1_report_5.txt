  "purpose": "Defines file paths to specific Excel rule catalog files relative to the current script location.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current script's file path (__file__) to determine the catalog directory.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; no data leaks or security effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Path calculations from __file__ to specific Excel files; no untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior; standard path manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path from pathlib, sets a base directory relative to the script's location, and defines three paths to specific Excel files. There are no input validation, no network communication, and no dynamic execution. It appears to be a straightforward setup for file referencing, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign setup for referencing local files; it does not contain malware or security risks.",
