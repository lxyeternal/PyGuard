  "purpose": "Defines file paths to specific Excel files within the same directory as the script, presumably for configuration or data access.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current script's file location (__file__) to determine the directory path.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any actions that involve untrusted data processing or output; it only constructs file paths.",
  "flows": "N/A, the code only constructs Path objects based on the script location.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code features. The code uses standard library functions and straightforward path operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path from pathlib, defines a base directory _CATALOG based on the script's directory, and constructs three Path objects pointing to specific Excel files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a simple resource locator within a project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define file paths relative to the script location. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
