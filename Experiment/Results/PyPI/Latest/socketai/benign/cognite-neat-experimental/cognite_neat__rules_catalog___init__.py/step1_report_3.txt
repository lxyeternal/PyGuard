  "purpose": "Defines file paths to specific Excel rule catalog files relative to the script location.",
  "sources": "Reads the script's own file location (__file__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Path construction from __file__ to specific filenames via Path objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward path concatenation. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path for filesystem operations, constructs a base directory from the script's location, and defines three file paths for specific Excel files within that directory. There are no dynamic inputs, no data processing, and no network interactions or obfuscated code. The code appears to be part of a configuration or setup routine for file access. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign setup for referencing catalog files. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
