      "conclusion": "The code is a benign validation utility for naming conventions and reserved words, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores across reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and very low security risk scores justified by the static, validation-focused nature of the code."

      "conclusion": "The code shows high obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion but lacking definitive malicious payloads. Scores reflect cautious assessment, with moderate malware and security risk levels justified by obfuscation and dynamic features. No conclusive malicious activity detected, but the potential for concealment warrants caution."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation and serialization setup with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to the use of warnings which are controlled and unlikely to be exploited. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the low but present caution around warning message handling."
