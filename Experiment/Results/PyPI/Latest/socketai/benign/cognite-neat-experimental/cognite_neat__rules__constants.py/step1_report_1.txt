{
  "purpose": "This code defines regex patterns, enums, and functions for validating and processing entity identifiers and reserved words in a data modeling or schema context.",
  "sources": "The code reads constant data for regex validation, enum values, and reserved word lists. No external input sources are present in the code snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or execution flows triggered by external input.",
  "flows": "The code primarily compiles regex patterns and provides methods for matching entity names against these patterns. There are no source-to-sink data flows or processing pipelines involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual behavior; it primarily provides validation mechanisms. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. No obfuscation or malicious code execution patterns are identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns, an enum class, and utility functions for validation of entity identifiers against reserved words and naming conventions. It carefully manages compatibility with different Python versions and uses caching to optimize pattern compilation. There are no indications of malicious behavior or suspicious constructs. The regex patterns are straightforward and serve validation purposes only. No external data inputs, network access, or file operations are present, reducing risk of supply chain or runtime malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation utility for naming conventions and reserved words, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be safe and focused solely on pattern matching and validation logic.",
