{
  "purpose": "The code provides pattern matching and validation functions for entity identifiers and reserved words in a schema or data modeling context.",
  "sources": "User-provided strings such as entity names, IDs, and input data validated against regex patterns; reserved words lists used for validation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external systems; code primarily performs validation and pattern matching within the application context.",
  "flows": "Input strings are matched against regex patterns through various validation functions to ensure format compliance and avoid reserved word conflicts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are detected. The code uses regex for validation, which appears standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data validation routines and pattern matching for schema-related identifiers, including reserved words and regex compliance rules. It uses regex for checking naming conventions and reserved word exclusions. The logic is straightforward, focusing on input validation and pattern matching. No data leakage, malicious data handling, or suspicious network activity is present. The only potential concern could be the regex validation if improperly used elsewhere, but within this code, it appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard pattern validation module for schema/entity identifiers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It functions solely to enforce naming conventions and reserved word restrictions without external side effects.",
