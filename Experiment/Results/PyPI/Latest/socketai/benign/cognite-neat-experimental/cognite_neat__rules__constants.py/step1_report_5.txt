{
  "purpose": "The code defines regex patterns and validation functions for entity naming conventions and reserved words, likely used for schema or data model validation in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily through regex patterns and predefined lists, such as get_reserved_words() and get_internal_properties(). No external input sources or untrusted data ingestion are evident within this fragment.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network I/O, file I/O, or command execution. The code primarily compiles regex patterns and provides validation functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly provides utility functions for pattern matching and validation of identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The only notable points are extensive regex patterns and conditional logic for validation, which appear to be standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements regex-based validation for entity identifiers and reserved words. It includes conditional regex compilation based on Python version and cached pattern compilation for efficiency. All functions and patterns serve validation purposes and do not perform data exfiltration, command execution, or network operations. There is no obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic detected. The patterns ensure that identifiers conform to naming rules and avoid reserved words, which is standard for schema validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard validation utility for schema/entity naming conventions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any external data transmission, command execution, or harmful operations. The overall security risk is very low.",
