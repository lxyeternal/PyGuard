{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define validation patterns, enumerations, and helper functions for managing entity types and their identifiers in a data modeling or ontology context.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external data or user input directly; it mainly defines constants, regex patterns, and functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or output; no data is written to external systems or network connections.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely compiles regex patterns and provides validation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The regex patterns and enum definitions are standard. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines entity types via an enum, several regex patterns for validation of identifiers and names, and helper functions for retrieving reserved words and compliance patterns. The regex patterns include checks against reserved words, enforce naming conventions, and avoid certain patterns within brackets. The code utilizes cached properties for efficiency and raises exceptions for unsupported entity types, indicating robust handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. All functions serve validation and pattern matching purposes in a typical data validation context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation utility module for managing entity naming conventions and types with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily provides pattern matching and enumeration support for data integrity enforcement.",
