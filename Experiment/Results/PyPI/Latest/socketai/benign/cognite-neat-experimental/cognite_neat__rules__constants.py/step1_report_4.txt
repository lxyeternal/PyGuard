{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define data validation patterns, enumerations, and utility functions for handling entity identifiers and reserved words within a larger data management or ontology system.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input; it only defines constants, regex patterns, and functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that handle untrusted data; no network, file, or system command executions.",
  "flows": "The code primarily provides regex validation flows for various entity identifiers and reserved words, with no data processing or data flow outside validation contexts.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors. The regex patterns are standard, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. Usage of dynamic regex compilation is standard for such validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enumerations, regex patterns, and validation functions for specific identifier types, such as space names, view IDs, class IDs, and version identifiers. It uses standard Python libraries and conditional imports for compatibility. No user input handling, data processing, or network operations are present. The code is purely structural and validation-focused, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It avoids suspicious patterns like code injection, system calls, or data leaks. The regex patterns include safeguards against reserved words and invalid formats. Overall, the code is straightforward and appears to be a safe utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a validation utility module that defines regex patterns, enumerations, and functions for entity identifier validation. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It is well-structured, and its purpose is data validation without any evident security risks or malicious intent.",
