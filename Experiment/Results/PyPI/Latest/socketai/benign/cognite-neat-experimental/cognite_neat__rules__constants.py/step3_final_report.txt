{
  "purpose": "The code provides validation patterns, enums, and functions for entity identifiers and reserved words, primarily serving as a static validation utility without external data handling or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns, enum definitions, and validation functions that read static strings and constants; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Validation functions compile regex patterns and match input strings against them; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as all data is validated against static patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard regex validation, enum usage, and static data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns, enums, and validation functions for entity identifiers and reserved words, with version compatibility considerations. It employs regex for validation, uses caching for patterns, and includes functions for reserved word checks. No external data input, network operations, or malicious code are present. The code's purpose is to validate naming conventions and reserved words, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The regex patterns are standard and serve static validation purposes. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected. The code is well-structured, clear, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign validation utility for naming conventions and reserved words, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores across reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and very low security risk scores justified by the static, validation-focused nature of the code.",
