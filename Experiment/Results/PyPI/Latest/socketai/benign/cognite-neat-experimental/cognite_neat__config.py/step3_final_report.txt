{
  "purpose": "This code defines a configuration data model using pydantic, allowing validation and assignment for application settings related to progress bar type and iteration threshold.",
  "sources": "No external input; static code defining class attributes and default values.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks; purely static setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard libraries, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing and pydantic modules, defines a simple configuration class with two optional fields, and instantiates a global configuration object. It contains no external input handling, no dynamic code, and no suspicious patterns. The code is static, clear, and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration class with no malicious or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
