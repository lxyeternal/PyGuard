  "purpose": "Define a configuration model using pydantic for controlling progress bar options and thresholds.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attributes, default value assignments",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external output",
  "flows": "Initialization of GLOBAL_CONFIG from NeatConfig, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward use of pydantic BaseModel with type annotations",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple configuration class with options for progress bars, using standard pydantic features. It sets a default configuration object. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no dynamic code execution, no data leakage, or suspicious network activity. The code is minimal and standard in structure, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration setup with no malicious intent or security risks.",
