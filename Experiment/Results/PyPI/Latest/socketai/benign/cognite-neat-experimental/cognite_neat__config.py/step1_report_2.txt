  "purpose": "Define a configuration model for a Python application using pydantic, allowing for validated and typed configuration settings.",
  "sources": "None (no external input, no data reading, no user input, no environment variable access).",
  "targets": "No sinks or data flows from untrusted sources; the code only initializes a configuration object.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no source-to-sink data flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "None observed. The code uses standard library and pydantic features; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing and pydantic, defines a configuration class with validated fields including a Literal type, and instantiates a global configuration object. No external input or potentially malicious code is present. The code is straightforward, with no indications of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
