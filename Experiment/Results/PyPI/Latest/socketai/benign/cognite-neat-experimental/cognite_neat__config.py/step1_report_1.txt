  "purpose": "Define a configuration model for a program, with options for progress bar type and threshold.",
  "sources": "None; no input reading or data acquisition from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard type annotations and pydantic for data validation. It defines a configuration class with optional fields for progress bar type and threshold, with default values. It then instantiates a global configuration object. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious activities. The code is straightforward and uses common libraries in a standard manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration class without any malicious or suspicious elements. It performs standard configuration setup with no security risks identified.",
