  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically and compare them with the code to determine if any issues are present.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Indicators of Security Risks:**\n   - All reports conclude that the code is benign, containing only configuration, namespace setup, environment detection, and constants.\n   - The environment detection functions (_is_in_notebook, _is_in_browser) are standard utilities, not suspicious.\n   - No network operations, file writes, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input are present.\n   - No obfuscated, hidden, or suspicious code patterns are observed.\n   - The code primarily initializes static data structures, constants, and utility functions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is configuration-heavy and environment-aware but benign.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the code.\n   - The reasoning that the code is safe and standard is sound.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The risk scores are also 0, justified by the absence of any malicious activity.\n   - The confidence levels are 1, reflecting high certainty.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions; the analysis correctly notes the lack of dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n   - Environment detection functions are standard and pose no security concern.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores with the Code:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a straightforward setup module with environment detection, constants, namespace definitions, and configuration data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The environment detection functions are standard utilities, and the data structures are static and non-executable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the provided reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, and the overall security risk is negligible.\n\n**Final Recommended Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
