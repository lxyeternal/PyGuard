{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define utility functions, constants, and namespace configurations for a Python library related to data modeling, RDF/semantic web, and Cognite data platform integration.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment info (_is_in_notebook, _is_in_browser), module imports, and constants from the filesystem (PACKAGE_DIRECTORY, neat.__file__). It also reads configuration and property definitions within functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain obvious sinks such as network operations, file writes, or data exfiltration. No external data is written or transmitted directly.",
  "flows": "The code initializes environment detection, sets up constants, and defines data structures. No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors, are present. The environment detection functions are straightforward. Namespace definitions and property constants are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly configuration and environment detection logic for a data modeling library. No user input or untrusted data sources are processed. All data appears to be static or internally defined. The functions are simple and aim to detect runtime environments (notebook or browser). No network or system commands, or dynamic code execution, are present. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected. The constants and functions serve typical utility purposes in a data modeling context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for configuration and environment detection within a data modeling library. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
