{
  "purpose": "This code sets up configurations, constants, and utility functions for the NEAT library, primarily involving RDF/OWL namespace definitions, environment detection, and data model constants.",
  "sources": "Environment detection functions (_is_in_notebook, _is_in_browser), configuration variables (PACKAGE_DIRECTORY, COGNITE_MODELS, COGNITE_SPACES, COGNITE_CONCEPTS), namespace definitions, and constant data structures.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present that process untrusted data inputs, nor are there any network connections, file writes, or external command executions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations are evident; the code mainly defines constants and configuration, with some environment detection logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling are present. The environment detection functions are standard, and constants are typical. No malicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises static definitions, environment detection functions, and constants related to data models and RDF namespaces. It includes functions to detect whether running in a Jupyter notebook or browser (Pyodide), but these are standard environment checks. No external inputs are processed dynamically, nor are there any network or file operations that could be exploited. The use of imported modules is typical for RDF and data modeling, and no obfuscation or suspicious logic is present. The data structures and constants appear to be standard configuration or reference data for the NEAT library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely configuration and environment detection with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute potentially harmful code. Therefore, the likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
