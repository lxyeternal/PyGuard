  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily static configuration, environment detection, and namespace setup.\n   - The environment detection functions (`_is_in_notebook`, `_is_in_browser`) are standard checks for runtime context and are not suspicious.\n   - No network operations, file writes, dynamic code execution, or external data handling are present.\n   - No obfuscated, encrypted, or hidden code segments are identified.\n   - The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident; the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n   - The environment detection functions are correctly implemented for their purpose.\n   - The constants and data structures are static and seem appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), which aligns with the assessment.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior are detected, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The code appears to be standard setup code for a data modeling library.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, reflecting the absence of malicious intent.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on what the code actually does.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n\n**Summary & Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final Justification:**\nThe code is a standard configuration module, environment detection, and namespace setup for a data modeling framework. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no vulnerabilities. The environment detection functions are safe and commonly used. The constants and data structures are static and do not pose security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with all reports' assessments.",
