  "purpose": "Configuration setup, environment detection, namespace definitions, and static constants for the NEAT data modeling library.",
  "sources": "Environment detection functions (_is_in_notebook, _is_in_browser), static constants, namespace definitions, imported modules (re, pathlib, typing, rdflib, cognite.client).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration and environment detection functions do not involve data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and standard for configuration purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of environment detection utilities, namespace and constant definitions, and static configuration data. It does not perform any network communication, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted data. The environment detection functions are standard and correctly implemented. All imported modules are used for configuration and utility purposes. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely setup and configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration and utility setup code with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. It is safe within the supply chain context, and no further action is necessary.",
