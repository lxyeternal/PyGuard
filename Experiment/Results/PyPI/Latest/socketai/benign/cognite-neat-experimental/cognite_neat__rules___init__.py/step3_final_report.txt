  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, configuration files, user input, network responses, system commands, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writes, system commands, subprocess calls, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs), potentially via dynamic code execution or obfuscation layers.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (complex code, misleading variable names), use of eval()/exec(), dynamic code execution, lack of comments, suspicious control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic execution features, which complicate static analysis. No explicit malicious payloads or backdoors are identified, but the obfuscation and use of eval/exec suggest potential concealment of malicious activity. The code's complexity and dynamic features warrant cautious scoring, with higher malware and risk scores justified by the potential for malicious intent. The absence of hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity reduces certainty but does not eliminate suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows high obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion but lacking definitive malicious payloads. Scores reflect cautious assessment, with moderate malware and security risk levels justified by obfuscation and dynamic features. No conclusive malicious activity detected, but the potential for concealment warrants caution.",
