{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures, type aliases, and a generic class for managing rules related to DMS and Information models, serving as a schema or data container.",
  "sources": "Imports models and utilities; no input reading or data processing within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; code does not process or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Static definitions and type aliases; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class definitions, type aliases, and simple class methods/properties. It relies on imported models but does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The structure is straightforward and static, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a schema or data container for rules management. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. The current scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
