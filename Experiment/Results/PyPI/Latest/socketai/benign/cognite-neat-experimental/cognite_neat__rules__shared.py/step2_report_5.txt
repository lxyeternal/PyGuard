  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for potential issues, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is primarily composed of data classes, type aliases, and straightforward class methods/properties.\n- No input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, declarative, and lacks malicious intent.\n- The malware score is consistently zero across reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which seems appropriate given the code's scope.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is a set of data structures and type aliases with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The reports do not find any logical or security flaws.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The malware scores are 0, which is appropriate. Security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not execute or process untrusted data, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All are 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The highest is 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's non-executive, declarative nature.\n\n- **Potential assumptions:**  \n  No report makes unwarranted assumptions about hidden malicious behavior; they all correctly interpret the code as data modeling.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a well-structured data model with no security concerns.\n- **Scores:** The scores across all reports are appropriate and consistent.\n- **Potential improvements:** None necessary; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.05 (very low, as the code is purely declarative and does not handle untrusted data)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current reports and scores are accurate and reasonable. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.",
