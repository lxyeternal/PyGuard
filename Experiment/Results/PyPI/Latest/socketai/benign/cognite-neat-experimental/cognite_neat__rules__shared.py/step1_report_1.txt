{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and type aliases for reading and handling rules related to DMS and Information models, including context and display functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports modules for data modeling, typing, and spreadsheet reading; class methods and properties that access class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly processes untrusted data; no sink points for untrusted data leading to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from external sources to sensitive operations or external outputs; primarily static type and data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present; class methods are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines generic data classes and type aliases for rules management, utilizing type hints and class methods. No data input handling, no network operations, no file I/O, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to serve as a schema or data container for rules, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard data modeling setup with no malicious intent or security concerns. It lacks data input handling, network communication, or execution of untrusted code, indicating a low security risk.",
