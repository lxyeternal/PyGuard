{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and type aliases for reading and handling rules related to DMS and Information models, with no direct execution logic.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (cognite.neat), type annotations, and class methods/attributes within the code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code does not process or execute untrusted data within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to potentially dangerous sinks is evident in this isolated code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is primarily declarative and type-annotated.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and defines data classes and type aliases for rule handling. It includes a generic class ReadRules with methods to display type names and properties for rule status. There are no functions executing untrusted input, no network or file operations, and no obfuscated code. The use of type aliases and dataclasses appears standard for type safety and structure. No malicious intent or security risks are apparent based solely on this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for rule management using Python's type annotations and dataclasses. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no evident security risks or malware in this snippet.",
