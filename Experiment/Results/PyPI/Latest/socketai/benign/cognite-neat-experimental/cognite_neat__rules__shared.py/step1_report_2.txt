  "purpose": "Define data structures for reading and representing rules with associated context and display information.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and classes; class and method definitions; class variables and properties.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows leading to potential data leakage or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve reading rules and context; no untrusted input handling, no execution or data transmission observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is primarily data structure definitions with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases, a generic data class, and properties for displaying rule information. There is no evidence of input handling, data validation, network activity, or code execution. The structure relies on imported models for rules, with no suspicious logic. The code appears to serve as part of a larger system for rules management, not containing any malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward data structure and type alias definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could compromise security or reveal sensitive data.",
