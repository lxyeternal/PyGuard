  "purpose": "Define data structures and type aliases for handling rules and input rules related to the 'cognite.neat' module, including reading and displaying rules.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'cognite.neat._rules.models' and 'cognite.neat._utils.spreadsheet', class and method definitions within the file",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing, network operations, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily defines types and data structures",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The code uses standard Python features and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases, data classes, and properties related to rules handling within a specific module. It imports models for rules and input rules, as well as a spreadsheet utility. No data input/output handling or untrusted data processing is present. The class ReadRules manages rules with a display method, but no input validation or external interactions occur. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior are detected. The structure is standard and straightforward, serving as a type and data container.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module that defines data structures and type aliases for rules management. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code fragment.",
