{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and type aliases for reading and representing rules, including verification status and context.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules, class methods, property, and class variables.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no data is written to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; code primarily defines data models and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines generic data classes and type aliases for handling rules and their read status. It imports specific models and utility functions but does not execute any potentially malicious operations. No input/output operations, network connections, or data leaks are present. The use of type variables and generics appears standard for type safety and code organization. Overall, the code is structurally straightforward and does not demonstrate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data models and type aliases for rule management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for structured data handling within a larger system.",
