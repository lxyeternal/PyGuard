  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data processing or external outputs",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns static string values to variables __version__ and __engine__, which is a common practice for package metadata. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no external communication or code execution present. The code appears straightforward and conventional, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard package metadata declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
