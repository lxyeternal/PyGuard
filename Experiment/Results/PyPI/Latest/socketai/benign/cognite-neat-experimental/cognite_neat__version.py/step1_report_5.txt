  "purpose": "The code defines version and engine metadata for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing logic is present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of version and engine metadata variables, which are common in package setup files; no suspicious or unusual code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two string assignments to variables __version__ and __engine__. These are typical in Python packages to specify versioning and engine compatibility. There are no sources of untrusted data, no data flows, and no operations that could be malicious. The variables do not contain obfuscated or malicious code, and no external dependencies or code execution is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard metadata declarations for a Python package and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
