  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\nThe original code:\n```python\n__version__ = \"0.119.10\"\n__engine__ = \"^2.0.4\"\n```\nis straightforward: two static string assignments. There are no inputs, no external calls, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns. The code is typical for package metadata.\n\n2. **Issue Presence:**\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n- No obfuscation, no external dependencies, no code execution, no data flows.\n- The code is benign and standard.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as simple variable assignments for metadata.\n- They uniformly conclude no malicious intent or security risks.\n- No logical errors or reasoning flaws are apparent.\n\n4. **Score Evaluations:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Justification:**\n- Since the code is just static string assignments, the risk score should be 0.\n- Malware score should be 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The reports' scores align with this assessment.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all correctly interpret the code as metadata.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are unjustified.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard package metadata declaration with no security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the code's nature.",
