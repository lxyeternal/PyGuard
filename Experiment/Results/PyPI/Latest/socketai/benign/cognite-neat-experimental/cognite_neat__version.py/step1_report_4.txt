  "purpose": "Defines version and engine compatibility information for a Python package.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows identified, as the code only assigns string variables.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; the variables are straightforward string assignments with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only two string variable assignments: __version__ and __engine__. There are no external data inputs, no use of environment variables, no code execution, and no network operations. The version string and engine specifier are typical for Python packages and do not indicate malicious intent. The simplicity suggests it's a standard metadata declaration. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata for a Python package. It poses no security risk or malware concern.",
