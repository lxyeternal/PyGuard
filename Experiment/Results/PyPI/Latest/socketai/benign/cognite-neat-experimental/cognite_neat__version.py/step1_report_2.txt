  "purpose": "Define version and engine dependencies for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version and engine variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only assigns static strings to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is simple, static assignments with no dynamic or obfuscated content.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static string values to two variables: __version__ and __engine__. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious constructs such as dynamic execution, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The content appears to be standard for package metadata declarations. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to specify version and engine compatibility information for a package. There are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation detected.",
