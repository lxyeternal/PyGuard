  "purpose": "Static assignment of package version and engine information for metadata purposes.",
  "sources": "No external input; static string assignments to __version__ and __engine__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow, external calls, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; the code consists solely of static variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static declaration of package metadata variables. No inputs, outputs, external dependencies, or dynamic behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code aligns with standard practices for package metadata declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications or concerns are warranted.",
