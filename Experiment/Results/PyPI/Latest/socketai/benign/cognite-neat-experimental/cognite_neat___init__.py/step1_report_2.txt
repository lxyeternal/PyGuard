{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module exports and import specific components related to session handling, utility functions, and version information for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for _session, auth utility, and version information",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and functions, then defines the public API via __all__. There is no processing, data handling, or dynamic execution. The imported modules may contain sensitive or malicious code, but this snippet does not demonstrate any malicious behavior itself. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, establishing public interface.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard module initializer setting up exports for a package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
