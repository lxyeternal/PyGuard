{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing internal modules and exposing selected components via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_session, _utils.auth, _version).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "Import sources are static; no data flows or untrusted data processing occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports internal modules and defines __all__, with no dynamic execution, data handling, or network activity. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The imported modules could contain malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone. The structure is typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The minimal security concern regarding imported modules is speculative and does not warrant increased malware or risk scores.",
