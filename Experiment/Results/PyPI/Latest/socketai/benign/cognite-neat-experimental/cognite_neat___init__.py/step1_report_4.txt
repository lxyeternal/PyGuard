  "purpose": "Module initialization and export of key functions and classes related to session management, utilities, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._session, ._utils.auth, and ._version.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks is visible.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions from internal modules, then defines an __all__ list for exports. No dynamic execution, no external input handling, and no suspicious logic or backdoors. The imports from internal modules could potentially perform malicious actions, but that cannot be determined from this snippet alone. The code structure appears standard for a Python package __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code fragment. It functions as a standard module initializer, exporting selected classes and functions.",
