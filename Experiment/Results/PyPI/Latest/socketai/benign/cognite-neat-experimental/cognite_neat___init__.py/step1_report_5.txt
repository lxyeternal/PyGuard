  "purpose": "To import modules and define public API elements for the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_session, _utils.auth, _version).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only module imports and declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import statements and __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules and functions, and defines the public interface via __all__. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations. The get_cognite_client function may perform authentication or network calls internally, but nothing in this snippet suggests malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import and API declaration setup with no signs of malicious activity or security issues based on this snippet.",
