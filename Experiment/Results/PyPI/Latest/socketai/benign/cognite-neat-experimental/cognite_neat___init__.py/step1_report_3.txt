{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module exports for a package, exposing classes and functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules '_session', '_utils.auth', and '_version'. No external or untrusted data sources are read here.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points are present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs are visible.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and declares exports without processing data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are detected. The code follows standard module setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from internal modules, then exposes them via __all__ for package consumers. There are no suspicious behaviors, malicious injections, or obfuscated code. No external data sources, sinks, or flows suggest malicious activity. The code serves as a straightforward module initializer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard module setup code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely defines what is publicly accessible in this package.",
