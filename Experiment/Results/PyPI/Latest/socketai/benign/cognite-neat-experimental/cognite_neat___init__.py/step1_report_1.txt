  "purpose": "Module exports and imports for a package, defining the public API",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._session, ._utils.auth, ._version",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or execution points",
  "flows": "Imports do not directly flow data; they bring in functions/classes for external use",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from internal modules, assigns an __all__ variable for public API definition, and references the package version. All actions are standard for Python package modules. No data leaks, no suspicious behavior, no external network activity, or malicious code observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward module export setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical, safe package initialization code.",
