{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and utility methods for handling objects, lists, and RDF data representations, primarily for data serialization and HTML rendering.",
  "sources": "Code reads Python standard libraries, third-party libraries (pandas, rdflib), and system info (sys).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from object dump methods to HTML or DataFrame representations; no external data transmission is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs detected. The code primarily defines classes and data handling functions.",
  "analysis": "The code creates abstract base classes and concrete implementations for objects that can be dumped to dictionaries, rendered as HTML, and handled within lists. It also sets up type aliases for RDF triples. Usage of pandas and rdflib is for data processing and RDF representation. There are no functions that accept untrusted input or perform external actions such as network communication, file operations, or system modifications. The code structure is standard and does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for data handling with no malicious intent, no suspicious data flows, and no external communication. It is standard in design, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
