      "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured utility for splitting git patch files. There are no signs of malicious activity, supply chain risks, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1 in one report) is justified by standard filesystem operations. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
