  "purpose": "Utility script to split large git patch files into smaller parts based on hunks or fixed parts, with options to organize output files.",
  "sources": "Reads input files or stdin (fileinput.input), reads command-line arguments, reads directory contents for cleaning.",
  "sinks": "Writes output patch files to specified directory, prints to stderr for logs.",
  "flows": "Input files or stdin -> parsing and processing hunks -> splitting into parts -> writing split patches to output directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code patterns; no obfuscated code; standard usage of Python modules; proper argument validation; no network or system manipulation found.",
  "analysis": "The script is a utility for splitting git patch files. It uses standard Python modules, performs input validation, and handles file operations safely. No network calls, no dynamic code execution, no system manipulation, no credential handling. It reads input files or stdin, processes diff hunks, and writes output files, with options for splitting by parts or hunks, and for cleaning or creating directories. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The code's structure appears consistent with its described purpose. No obfuscation or malware indicators detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-built utility for processing and splitting git patch files. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or malware embedded in this code.",
