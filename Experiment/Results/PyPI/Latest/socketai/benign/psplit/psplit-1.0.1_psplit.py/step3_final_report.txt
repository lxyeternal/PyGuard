  "purpose": "A utility to split large git patch files into smaller parts based on hunks or parts, facilitating easier management and review of patches.",
  "sources": "Reads input files or stdin, parses patch headers and hunks, processes filenames for sanitization.",
  "sinks": "Writes split patch files to specified directory, logs progress to stderr.",
  "flows": "Input lines are read from files or stdin, parsed into patch components, split into parts, and written to output files with sanitized filenames.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Filename sanitization is benign. Directory cleanup is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O, argument validation, directory management, and patch parsing. It does not contain network activity, dynamic code execution, or credential handling. The splitting logic is straightforward, based on hunks or parts, with filename sanitization replacing certain characters. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The security and malware scores are consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured utility for splitting git patch files. There are no signs of malicious activity, supply chain risks, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1 in one report) is justified by standard filesystem operations. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
