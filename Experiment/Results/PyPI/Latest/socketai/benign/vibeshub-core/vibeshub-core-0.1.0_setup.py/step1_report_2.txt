  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'vibeshub-core' Python package, defining its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata; no runtime input or data reading sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is purely configuration and does not process data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and requirements. It includes no input handling, no code execution beyond static configuration, and no external data processing or network activities. The package information appears typical for Python projects, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup configuration with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
