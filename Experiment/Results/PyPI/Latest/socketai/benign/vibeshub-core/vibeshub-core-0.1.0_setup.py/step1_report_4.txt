  "targets": "The setup function uses this data to build the package; no untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static declarations into the setup() function to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution present. No suspicious patterns or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic inputs, external data processing, or suspicious behavior. The code strictly adheres to typical packaging conventions.",
