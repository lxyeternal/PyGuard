  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'chunk_list' function in the 'vibeshub' module",
  "sources": "Input data provided in test cases (lists 'data') and function parameter values",
  "sinks": "Assertions that validate the output of 'chunk_list'",
  "flows": "Input lists are processed by 'chunk_list' and compared with expected results in assertions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. No dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pytest' and tests the 'chunk_list' function from 'vibeshub'. It contains three test functions: one for basic chunking, one for exact chunk division, and one for invalid size handling. All tests are straightforward, with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The tests only check expected behaviors and exceptions. There are no external data sources, no use of environment variables, no network activity, and no suspicious code structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a utility function, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and purposefully designed for testing functionality.",
