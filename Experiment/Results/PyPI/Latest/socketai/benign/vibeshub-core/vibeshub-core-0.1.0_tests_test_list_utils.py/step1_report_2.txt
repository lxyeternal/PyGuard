  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'chunk_list' function in the 'vibeshub' module.",
  "sources": "Input data for testing, such as 'data' lists and parameters for 'chunk_list'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Test data flows into 'chunk_list' function; no data leaks or untrusted data handling beyond test scope.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains straightforward unit tests using pytest to verify the behavior of 'chunk_list'. It checks normal chunking, exact chunk division, and invalid chunk size handling. No external input processing or risky code execution is present. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified. The tests are standard and serve to validate functionality without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for a list-chunking function with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It contains no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious data handling, and no malware indicators.",
