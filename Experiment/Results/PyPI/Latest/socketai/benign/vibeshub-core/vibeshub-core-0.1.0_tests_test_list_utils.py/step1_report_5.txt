  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'chunk_list' function in the 'vibeshub' package",
  "sources": "The test code reads input data from defined variables within test functions",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data leaks are present",
  "flows": "Input data is passed directly to 'chunk_list' with no external or untrusted data sources, and results are checked within test assertions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pytest' framework and the 'chunk_list' function from 'vibeshub'. It defines three straightforward unit tests: testing basic chunking, exact chunk division, and handling invalid chunk size input. All tests operate on hardcoded data and perform assertions to verify expected output. There are no dynamic code executions, no external data sources, and no suspicious or malicious code constructs. The code's structure and content are typical for testing functions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a utility function, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and legitimate.",
