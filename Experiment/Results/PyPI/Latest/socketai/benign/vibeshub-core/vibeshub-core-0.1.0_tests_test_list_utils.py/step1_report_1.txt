  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'chunk_list' function in the 'vibeshub' module.",
  "sources": "Imports 'pytest' and the 'chunk_list' function; reads test data variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into 'chunk_list' function; no external or untrusted data flows out.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pytest' and a function from a local module, then defines three straightforward unit tests. The tests check for correct chunking of lists with different sizes and behavior with invalid input (size 0). All operations are standard testing procedures without any network calls, data leaks, or malicious code. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign set of unit tests with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code strictly performs testing of a utility function with no suspicious activity.",
