  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'chunk_list' function in the 'vibeshub' module, testing list chunking functionality.",
  "sources": "Input data in test functions (lists), function parameters (chunk size).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external calls present.",
  "flows": "Input lists are passed to 'chunk_list' with specified chunk sizes; no data leaks or malicious flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed. The code uses standard testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and a function 'chunk_list' from a local module. It defines three unit tests: one for basic functionality, one for exact chunk division, and one for invalid chunk size handling (zero). All tests verify expected behavior without involving external data, network, or system manipulation. No suspicious or malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a utility function, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
