  "purpose": "Utility function to divide a list into smaller chunks of a specified size.",
  "sources": "Input list parameter 'lst' and integer 'size'.",
  "sinks": "Yielded chunks of the list; no external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input list 'lst' flows through the function, generating chunks via 'yield'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward implementation with input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple generator function that chunks a list into parts of a specified size. It validates that 'size' is greater than zero, then iterates over the list in steps of 'size', yielding sublists. No external data, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility function with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs a common list operation with proper validation.",
