  "purpose": "This function chunks a list into smaller lists of a specified size.",
  "sources": "The input parameters 'lst' and 'size'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the function only processes input data to produce chunks.",
  "flows": "Input list 'lst' and 'size' are used to generate slices of the list, with no external data flow or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated logic, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The function checks that 'size' is positive, then iterates over the list in steps of 'size' to yield sublists. It is a simple utility function with no external data fetching, no command execution, and no interaction with environment variables. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns observed. The code appears to be a standard list processing utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign list utility function with no malicious intent or security risks.",
