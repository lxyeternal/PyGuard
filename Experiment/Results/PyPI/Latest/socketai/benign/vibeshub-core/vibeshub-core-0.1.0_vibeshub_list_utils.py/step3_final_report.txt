  "purpose": "A utility function to split a list into chunks of a specified size, with input validation.",
  "sources": "Input list 'lst' and integer 'size' parameter.",
  "sinks": "None; the function yields list slices without external data flow or side effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then list slices are generated sequentially.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with proper validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs list chunking with input validation, no external dependencies, and no suspicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, correctly identifying it as a simple utility. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's behavior. The confidence level is high (1), supported by multiple consistent reviews.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard list utility function with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores or analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
