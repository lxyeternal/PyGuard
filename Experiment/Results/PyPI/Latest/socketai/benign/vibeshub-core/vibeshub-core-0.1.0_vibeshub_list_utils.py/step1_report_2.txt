{
  "purpose": "Utility function to split a list into chunks of specified size.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'lst' (list to be chunked), input parameter 'size' (chunk size).",
  "sinks": "Yield statement which outputs chunks of the list.",
  "flows": "Input 'lst' and 'size' are processed to generate chunks via slicing; chunks are yielded as output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious variable names or unusual control flow. No input/output operations other than standard function parameters and yield.",
  "analysis": "The function checks if 'size' is greater than 0, then iterates over the list in steps of 'size', yielding slices. It performs basic list processing with proper validation and no external dependencies or side effects. The code appears to be a straightforward utility function without any obfuscated or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, well-structured list chunking utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to partition a list into smaller segments, with proper validation and no suspicious operations.",
