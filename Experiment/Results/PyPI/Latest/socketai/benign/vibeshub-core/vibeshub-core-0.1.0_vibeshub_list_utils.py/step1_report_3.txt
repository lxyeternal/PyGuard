{
  "purpose": "The function splits a given list into smaller chunks of specified size, facilitating processing of large lists in parts.",
  "sources": "The input parameters 'lst' (list) and 'size' (int).",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; the function yields list slices.",
  "flows": "Input 'lst' and 'size' flow through to list slicing and yielding chunks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward list chunking implementation with proper validation of 'size'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generator function that takes a list and a size parameter, checks for valid 'size', and yields chunks of the list. The logic is standard, with no use of external inputs beyond the parameters. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code performs a simple, safe operation: list slicing with input validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for list processing without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
