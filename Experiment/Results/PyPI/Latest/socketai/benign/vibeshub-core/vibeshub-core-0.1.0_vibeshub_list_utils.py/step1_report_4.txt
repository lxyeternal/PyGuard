  "purpose": "Utility function to split a list into chunks of a specified size.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'lst' (list to be chunked), 'size' (chunk size).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the function yields chunks of the input list.",
  "flows": "Input 'lst' and 'size' flow into the function, which generates chunks by slicing 'lst'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and standard for list chunking.",
  "analysis": "The function validates 'size' to be greater than zero, then iterates over 'lst' in steps of 'size', yielding slices. No external data sources, no unsafe operations, no use of environment variables or network activity. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard list chunking utility without any malicious intent or security risks.",
