  "purpose": "Initialize the package namespace by importing and exposing the 'chunk_list' function from the 'list_utils' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .list_utils import chunk_list",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or data leakage points are present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports a function and sets __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function 'chunk_list' from a local module 'list_utils' and defines '__all__' to expose it publicly. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no sink points. The code serves as a simple initializer for the package's namespace without performing any runtime actions or data handling. The structure is typical for a Python package init file, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It merely exposes a function from a local module, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
