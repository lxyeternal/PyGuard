  "flows": "Import of 'chunk_list' from local module; exposure via '__all__'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward '__init__.py' file that imports a utility function and exposes it. No dynamic behavior, data processing, or external data handling is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident. The code's environment and context do not suggest any hidden threats or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
