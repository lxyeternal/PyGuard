  "purpose": "Provides debugging commands via adb, specifically logcat and bugreport functions.",
  "sources": "User input 'options' in logcat, fixed command in bugreport.",
  "sinks": "run_command executes system commands, potentially in shell.",
  "flows": "logcat options -> string interpolation -> run_command -> system execution.",
  "anomalies": "Direct interpolation of 'options' without sanitization, potential command injection risk.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs adb commands, with 'logcat' incorporating user-supplied 'options' directly into the command string. If 'run_command' executes this string via a shell without sanitization, this can lead to command injection. 'bugreport' runs a static command, posing no risk. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The primary concern is the untrusted 'options' parameter. Malware score is 0; obfuscation score is 0; security risk score is approximately 0.4, reflecting moderate risk due to potential command injection if 'options' are untrusted and 'run_command' executes in a shell context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and intended for debugging. The main security concern is command injection via 'logcat' when 'options' are untrusted. No malware or obfuscation detected. To mitigate risk, sanitize 'options' before use. Scores are appropriate; risk is moderate. Overall, the assessment aligns with the code's behavior.",
