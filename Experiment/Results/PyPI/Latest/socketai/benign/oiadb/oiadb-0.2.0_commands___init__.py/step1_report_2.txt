  "purpose": "Import all functions, classes, or variables from various modules within the same package",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules in the package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; this code only performs imports",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; imports are static and do not process data",
  "anomalies": "All imports are straightforward; no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing all symbols from multiple local modules. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns are present. The import pattern is typical for modular Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module import pattern within a package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe based on the provided fragment.",
