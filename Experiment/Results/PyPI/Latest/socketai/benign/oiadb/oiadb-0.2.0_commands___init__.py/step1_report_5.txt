  "purpose": "Import all modules from the current package to make their functionalities available.",
  "sources": "No direct input or data reading; imports are static statements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks evident in import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; imports are static.",
  "anomalies": "Imports all symbols with wildcard '*', which can obscure module contents and potentially hide malicious code if present in the imported modules. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code in this snippet itself.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from relative modules, importing all contents from each module using wildcards. Such broad imports can be risky if the imported modules contain malicious code, but the snippet itself does not include any malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are visible here. Since the code only imports modules and does not execute or manipulate data directly, no immediate malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This file only contains import statements, which by themselves do not exhibit malicious intent. The use of wildcard imports could be a concern if imported modules are compromised, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
