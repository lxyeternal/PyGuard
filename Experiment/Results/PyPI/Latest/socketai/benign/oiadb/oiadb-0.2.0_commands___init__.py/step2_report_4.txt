  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code snippet consists solely of straightforward import statements from local modules.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, data handling, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n- The only minor concern is the use of wildcard imports (`from .module import *`), which can obscure the imported symbols but are common in some codebases.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, standard imports, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. No issues here.\n- **Verdict:** Sound assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes no malicious activity, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 (slightly elevated but acceptable given the wildcard import concern).\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. The security risk score is slightly higher due to wildcard imports but justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. No issues.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1. Slightly higher due to import style but justified.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes that wildcard imports can obscure module contents but does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2. Slightly higher, justified by potential risks of wildcard imports.\n- **Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1-0.2, reflecting minor concerns about wildcard imports but no actual security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — wildcard imports can be risky in some contexts, but given the benign nature of the code, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code snippet is a standard set of import statements from local modules, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with slight elevation in security risk due to wildcard imports, which is a common but sometimes discouraged practice. There is no need to adjust the scores upward or downward significantly.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Recommended Score |\n|------------------|-------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                       |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                       |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1                     |\n\nThis reflects a benign, well-understood code fragment with minimal security concern primarily related to import style.",
