  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor concern regarding wildcard imports is acknowledged but does not warrant a higher security risk score. Overall, the code poses a very low security threat and is typical for modular Python projects."
