{
  "purpose": "The code consists solely of multiple import statements importing various modules from the same package, serving to organize dependencies within a Python project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules such as .app_info, .apps, .basic, etc.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs static imports without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (from .module import *) in report 5, which can obscure imported symbols and pose maintainability or security concerns, though not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. The presence of wildcard imports is noted as a potential concern but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware=0 and obfuscated=0. The slight elevation in security risk scores (0.1-0.2) reflects the wildcard import pattern, which is a known best practice concern but not a security breach. The confidence in these assessments is high (0.9-1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor concern regarding wildcard imports is acknowledged but does not warrant a higher security risk score. Overall, the code poses a very low security threat and is typical for modular Python projects.",
