{
  "purpose": "The code is importing multiple modules from the current package, likely to organize and modularize the application's functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements at the beginning of the file importing from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data processing present in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible from import statements alone; no runtime execution paths shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected in import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules within the package. There is no executable logic, user input handling, or network operations visible. The import pattern indicates modular code organization. Since the code does not perform any operations or handle data, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks here. The absence of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data sources suggests no malicious intent or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard set of import statements for internal modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be part of a larger, organized codebase.",
