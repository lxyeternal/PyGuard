{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of methods for managing Android applications via ADB commands, including installation, uninstallation, data management, permission control, and retrieval of app info.",
  "sources": "Reads input data primarily from method arguments such as apk_path, package_name, permissions, and output from adb.run() calls.",
  "sinks": "Executes ADB shell commands that can modify app states, retrieve app info, or control app permissions; outputs are returned as strings or lists.",
  "flows": "User inputs (package names, permissions, file paths) are used to construct ADB commands; outputs from adb.run() are processed to provide info or control app behaviors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors such as obfuscated code, hard-coded secrets, or hidden backdoors. The code uses standard adb commands for app management without any dynamic code execution or hidden functionalities.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly follows standard Android app management procedures via ADB commands. It performs checks like file existence and package presence, handles exceptions properly, and logs operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or backdoor access. The commands are typical for device management and do not suggest sabotage or malware intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate library for managing Android applications via ADB, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It executes standard commands for app control and information retrieval. No suspicious or malicious signals were detected.",
