  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All five reports consistently state that the code is a straightforward wrapper around standard ADB commands for Android app management.\n   - No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code are identified.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or stealthy operations.\n   - The functions are typical for device management tasks, and the command strings are constructed from input parameters with appropriate validation.\n\n2. **Input Validation & Potential Risks:**\n   - The code performs basic validation such as checking if APK files exist before installation.\n   - There is no evidence of injection vulnerabilities or command injection risks, assuming inputs are sanitized at the caller level.\n   - The commands executed are standard Android debugging and management commands.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis that no malicious activity is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** The overall security risk is low (~0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n4. **Flow & Logic Checks:**\n   - The data flows from input parameters to command construction, which is then executed.\n   - Output parsing is straightforward and does not involve complex or suspicious logic.\n   - Exception handling is appropriate, raising specific errors when needed.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code relies on standard ADB commands and does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or exploits are made; the analysis is consistent with the code's functionality.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency & Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - Given the code's purpose and implementation, a malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified.\n   - The security risk score is appropriately low, reflecting the code's utility nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Category             | Score (0 to 1) | Justification                                                      |\n|----------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**        | **0**          | No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. |\n| **Obfuscated**     | **0**          | Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.                          |\n| **Risk**           | **0.1 - 0.2**  | Low risk; standard app management functions, minimal attack surface. |\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for managing Android apps via ADB. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified based on the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** I recommend continued monitoring if integrated into larger systems, but as a standalone utility, it appears safe and compliant with best practices.",
