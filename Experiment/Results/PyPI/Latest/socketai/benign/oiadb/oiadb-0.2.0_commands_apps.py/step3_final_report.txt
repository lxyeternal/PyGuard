  "purpose": "A Python class providing management functions for Android applications via ADB commands, including install, uninstall, list, and control operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as APK paths, package names, and command outputs from ADB execution.",
  "sinks": "Execution of ADB shell commands that modify device state, retrieve app info, or control app behavior.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct ADB commands; outputs are parsed for app info, package lists, or command success indicators.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code is straightforward and uses standard commands.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured wrapper around standard Android ADB commands for app management. It performs validation such as checking file existence and handles exceptions appropriately. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The commands executed are typical for device management tasks, and output parsing is straightforward. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and potential impact, which is low and typical for such utilities. The overall assessment indicates a legitimate, safe utility with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented utility for managing Android applications via ADB, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. Its risk profile is low, and the scores assigned are justified and consistent with its behavior.",
