{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of utility functions to interact with Android Debug Bridge (adb) commands, facilitating device management and command execution.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'device_id' parameter in 'custom_command', and command strings passed to 'usb_only' and 'emulator_only' functions.",
  "sinks": "The 'run_command' function calls are potential sinks where untrusted input (such as 'device_id' or 'command') could lead to command injection if not properly sanitized.",
  "flows": "Untrusted 'device_id' or 'command' inputs flow into 'run_command' via formatted strings, potentially executing arbitrary adb commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code uses direct command string formatting with user inputs, which could be risky if inputs are not sanitized, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward wrappers around adb commands, passing parameters directly into command strings. The 'custom_command', 'usb_only', and 'emulator_only' functions incorporate user input into command strings without sanitization, which could pose a security risk if used with untrusted input. However, there are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The structure is simple, and the functions are utility wrappers. Overall, no malicious behavior is detected, but the potential for command injection exists if input validation is not enforced outside this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for executing adb commands. It does not contain malicious behavior but should be used with trusted inputs to prevent command injection vulnerabilities. No malware or obfuscation is present.",
