  "purpose": "Wrapper functions for executing adb commands, facilitating device management tasks.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'device_id' and 'command' used directly in string formatting for system command execution.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands via run_command, potentially leading to command injection if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from function arguments into formatted command strings, then to run_command which executes them.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The main concern is lack of input sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward wrappers around adb commands, passing user-controlled inputs directly into system commands without sanitization. This creates a potential command injection vulnerability if inputs are untrusted. No malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is 0, consistent with the code's benign nature. The security risk score varies from 0.2 to 0.6 across reports, with higher scores justified when inputs are uncontrolled. The main risk stems from unvalidated inputs leading to arbitrary command execution. Proper input validation or sanitization is recommended to mitigate this risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility wrapper with no malicious intent but presents a security vulnerability due to unsanitized user inputs that could lead to command injection. No malware or obfuscation is detected. Implementing input validation will significantly reduce security risks.",
