  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the potential security implications, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code provides utility wrapper functions around adb commands.\n- User-controlled inputs (device_id, command) are interpolated directly into command strings.\n- The 'run_command' function executes these commands, but its implementation details are not provided.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The main concern is potential command injection if inputs are untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Malware**\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or signs of malware.\n- No data exfiltration, network communications, or malicious logic are evident.\n- The functions are straightforward wrappers, primarily passing parameters into system commands.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Malware score: 0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Obfuscation**\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No obfuscated code or techniques are used.\n- The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Obfuscated score: 0**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Security Risks and Command Injection Potential**\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The main risk stems from passing untrusted inputs into shell commands without sanitization.\n- Functions like `custom_command`, `usb_only`, and `emulator_only` directly interpolate parameters into command strings.\n- If an attacker supplies malicious input (e.g., command injection payloads), they could execute arbitrary commands on the host or manipulate devices.\n\n**Risk Score Justification:**\n- The reports assign a **security risk score of around 0.2 to 0.6**, depending on perceived vulnerability.\n- Given the direct interpolation and potential for command injection, **a risk score of 0.6** is justified if inputs are untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Malware and Obfuscation Scores in Reports**\n\n- All reports assign malware = 0, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated = 0, consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Scores Given in Reports**\n\n- The reports' scores are generally consistent with the analysis.\n- Most assign security risk between 0.2 and 0.6, reflecting potential command injection if inputs are untrusted.\n- Malware is consistently 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Note:** The reports emphasize that no malicious activity is present but highlight the potential security concern due to lack of input sanitization.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.6 — high potential for command injection if inputs are untrusted, which is a serious security concern.\n\n**Additional note:** To mitigate risks, input validation or sanitization should be implemented before passing parameters into these functions.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                | No malicious payloads or behavior detected.                |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.           |\n| Security Risk  | 0.6              | High if inputs are untrusted; potential command injection. |\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion,** the code itself is benign but poses a significant security risk if used with untrusted inputs. Proper validation is essential to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.",
