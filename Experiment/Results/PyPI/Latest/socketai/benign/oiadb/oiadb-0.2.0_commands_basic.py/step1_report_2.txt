  "purpose": "Wrapper functions for executing Android Debug Bridge (adb) commands",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as device_id and command in custom_command, usb_only, and emulator_only functions",
  "sinks": "run_command function executing adb commands, potentially executing arbitrary shell commands",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into run_command via string formatting, leading to adb command execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of string interpolation with user-controlled parameters without sanitization, potential command injection risk",
  "analysis": "The code defines several wrapper functions around run_command to execute adb commands. The custom_command, usb_only, and emulator_only functions incorporate user-provided inputs directly into command strings via f-strings, which could allow command injection if inputs are untrusted. However, there is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code relies on the assumption that run_command executes system commands securely, but the direct inclusion of parameters without validation is a potential security concern. Overall, the code is straightforward with no signs of malware or malicious behavior beyond the risk inherent in passing unsanitized input to shell commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code acts as a simple wrapper for adb commands, with a potential command injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input in some functions. No malicious activity or malware is detected. The primary concern is input validation, not malicious intent.",
