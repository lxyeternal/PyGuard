{
  "purpose": "Configure the setup and installation parameters for the 'oiadb' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, package metadata (name, version, author, URL, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data could lead to vulnerabilities; the code primarily sets package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads from the filesystem ('README.md') during setup, no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'README.md' without exception handling; no other suspicious or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads package description from a markdown file, defines package metadata, and specifies dependencies. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are processed. The code structure and content are typical for package configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal, benign package setup script with no indicators of malicious activity or security risks.",
