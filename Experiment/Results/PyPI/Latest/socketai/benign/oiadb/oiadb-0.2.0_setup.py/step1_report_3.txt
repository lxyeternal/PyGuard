  "purpose": "Configure and distribute a Python package named 'oiadb' with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; straightforward package setup process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'README.md' without exception handling, but this is standard practice in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python library. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or sensitive data processing is present. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code detected. The script is consistent with common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, serving solely to configure package distribution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
