{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'oiadb' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'README.md' for the long description, and imports from 'setuptools' for setup functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output to external systems detected.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' is read into 'long_description'; no other data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable aspect is reading an external file ('README.md') directly during setup, which is standard practice and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for packaging a Python library. It imports 'setuptools', calls 'setup' with metadata, and reads the long description from a file. No hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical setup tasks without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
