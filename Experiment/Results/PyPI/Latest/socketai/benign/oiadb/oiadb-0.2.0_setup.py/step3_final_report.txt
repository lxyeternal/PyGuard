  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without exception handling for reading 'README.md', but this is common in setup scripts and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It performs static configuration tasks without dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling untrusted input. The only minor issue is the lack of exception handling when reading 'README.md', which is standard practice but could cause errors if the file is missing. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard packaging code with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications or security concerns are necessary.",
