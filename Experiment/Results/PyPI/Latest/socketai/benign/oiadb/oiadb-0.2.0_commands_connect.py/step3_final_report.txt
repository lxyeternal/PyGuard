  "purpose": "Functions to connect or pair with an ADB device via IP and port, constructing commands dynamically.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'ip', 'port', and 'pairing_code' used in string formatting for command construction.",
  "sinks": "Execution of constructed command strings via 'run_command', which may execute in a shell environment.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into command strings, which are then passed to 'run_command' for execution.",
  "anomalies": "Direct interpolation of user inputs into command strings without validation or sanitization; no input validation or sanitization observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs system commands using user inputs and executes them via 'run_command'. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The primary concern is potential command injection if 'run_command' executes commands in a shell without sanitization, as inputs are interpolated directly. All reports correctly identify this risk but do not indicate active malicious behavior. Malware and obfuscation scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code. Security risk scores range from 0.2 to 0.45, reflecting potential command injection vulnerabilities. Given the lack of input validation, a moderate risk score (~0.4) is appropriate. The overall conclusion is that the code is benign but warrants input validation to prevent potential command injection exploits.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for ADB connection management with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is the potential for command injection due to unvalidated inputs. The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable. Implementing input validation or sanitization would mitigate this risk.",
