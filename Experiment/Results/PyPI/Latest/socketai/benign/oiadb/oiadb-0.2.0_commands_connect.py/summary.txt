  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for ADB connection management with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is the potential for command injection due to unvalidated inputs. The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable. Implementing input validation or sanitization would mitigate this risk."
