  "purpose": "Establishes ADB connections to devices via IP and port, with optional pairing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: ip, port, pairing_code.",
  "sinks": "run_command execution of constructed adb commands.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are interpolated into command strings which are then executed via run_command.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior; use of standard ADB commands is typical for device management.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs and executes ADB commands based on provided input parameters. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The functions serve legitimate purposes for device connection management. Since run_command is assumed to be a standard command execution function, there is no indication of malicious behavior. The code does not contain backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. It is a straightforward implementation of ADB connection commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for managing ADB connections with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external input but does not process or leak data maliciously.",
