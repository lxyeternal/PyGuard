{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to list permission groups and permission details on an Android device via adb commands.",
  "sources": "Input is derived from the execution of run_command with specific adb shell commands.",
  "sinks": "The run_command function executes shell commands that could potentially access sensitive device information.",
  "flows": "User code calls permission_groups() or permissions_details(), which invoke run_command with adb commands to gather permission info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures observed. The use of adb shell commands is typical for device management scripts. No obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports run_command from a local module, then defines two functions that execute adb shell commands to list permission groups and permission details. These commands query the Android package manager for permission information. The commands are standard for device management or debugging tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious command execution beyond standard device info retrieval. The code appears to be a simple utility wrapper around adb commands for permission listing. No anomalies or security risks are evident based on this isolated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for retrieving permission information from an Android device via adb. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The functions serve legitimate purposes related to device permission management.",
