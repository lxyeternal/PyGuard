  "purpose": "Functions to list permission groups and permission details via adb shell commands.",
  "sources": "Execution of static adb shell commands in run_command calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential exposure of sensitive permission data if misused.",
  "flows": "From run_command executing adb commands to output containing permission info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static command execution with no user input or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports run_command and defines two functions that execute standard adb commands to list permission groups and permissions. The commands are static and do not involve untrusted input, reducing command injection risk. The code is simple, clear, and does not contain obfuscation or secrets. The primary concern is privacy exposure if misused, but there is no malicious intent or behavior. The implementation of run_command is unknown, but assuming it executes commands securely, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for querying permission information on Android devices. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The potential security concern is privacy exposure, which is context-dependent but not inherent to the code itself.",
