  "purpose": "Functions to control device battery, USB, and screen resolution via adb shell commands.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (level, status, n, res).",
  "sinks": "Shell command execution via run_command with embedded parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters directly interpolated into command strings, passed to run_command.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets; lack of input validation before command construction.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward wrappers around adb shell commands, directly embedding input parameters without validation. All reports correctly identify potential command injection risk if run_command executes these strings in a shell without sanitization. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2-0.4) are reasonable, reflecting a low but notable risk if inputs are untrusted. The main concern is the lack of input validation, which could be exploited for command injection, but no evidence of malicious intent or payloads exists.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign device management utility with a potential security risk due to unvalidated inputs. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. To mitigate risks, input validation should be implemented. Current scores are appropriate; a slight increase in security risk score to 0.3 is recommended to reflect the command injection potential.",
