{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to control device battery parameters, USB status, and screen resolution via ADB commands.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'level', 'status', 'n', and 'res' provided to functions.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'run_command' with formatted ADB shell commands, which can modify device state.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into formatted strings that are passed to 'run_command', executing system commands that alter device configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code directly constructs system commands with user-provided input without validation or sanitization, which could be exploited if untrusted data is used.",
  "analysis": "The functions invoke system commands through 'run_command' to manipulate battery level, status, USB state, and screen resolution. These commands can change device behavior but are typical for device management scripts. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The direct use of formatted strings with external input could pose risks if inputs are untrusted, but the code itself does not exhibit malicious intent or malicious behavior. The functions rely on external 'run_command', and assuming it's a standard command execution wrapper, there is no evidence of malware. Overall, the code appears to be intended for device management purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for device configuration via ADB commands. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this fragment. The only minor concern is potential command injection if inputs are untrusted, but this does not indicate malicious activity.",
