{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to modify device battery parameters, USB status, and screen resolution via ADB commands.",
  "sources": "Functions generate commands based on input parameters, notably 'level', 'status', 'n', and 'res'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'run_command' with constructed ADB shell commands that alter device settings.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → formatted command strings → run_command execution of ADB commands.",
  "anomalies": "All commands are straightforward wrappers; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to modify system settings such as battery level, status, USB mode, and screen resolution by calling 'run_command' with specific ADB commands. These commands are intended for device management or testing. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The functions rely on input parameters to construct commands, which could potentially be misused if invoked maliciously, but this is not inherently malicious. The code itself is simple and does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides utility functions to modify device settings via ADB commands, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be intended for device configuration or testing purposes only.",
