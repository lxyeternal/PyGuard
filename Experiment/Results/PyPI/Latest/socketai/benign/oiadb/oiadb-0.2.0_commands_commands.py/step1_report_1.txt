{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to manipulate device battery levels, status, USB state, and screen resolution via adb shell commands.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: level, status, n, res passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "Execution of run_command with adb shell commands, which can modify device hardware states.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are embedded into shell commands and executed via run_command, potentially allowing malicious input to influence device state.",
  "anomalies": "All functions directly pass user-supplied parameters into adb shell commands without validation or sanitization. The functions can manipulate battery and display settings, which could be misused if controlled maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions that call run_command with specific adb shell commands related to device hardware configuration. The parameters for battery level, status, USB state, and resolution are directly embedded into the commands without any validation or sanitization, which could allow injection if run_command does not handle this internally. The functions themselves do not contain malicious code but expose device control capabilities that could be misused if accessed maliciously. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. The code appears to serve legitimate device management purposes but could be dangerous if misused or exploited.\n\nOverall, the code is straightforward and does not contain malware or obfuscation, but the ability to control device hardware remotely can be a security concern if misused.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides functions to control device battery and display settings via adb commands. While not inherently malicious, these functions could be exploited if accessed by an attacker, as they allow modification of critical device states. There are no signs of malware or obfuscation, but the security risk depends on context and access controls.",
