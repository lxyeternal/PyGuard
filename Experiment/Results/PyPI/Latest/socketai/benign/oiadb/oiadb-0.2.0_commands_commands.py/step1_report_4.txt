{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to modify device battery parameters and screen resolution via adb commands.",
  "sources": "User input for 'level', 'status', 'res', and 'n' parameters in function calls.",
  "sinks": "Execution of run_command with formatted adb shell commands that interact with device hardware.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are interpolated into adb commands executed through run_command, which then interact with device settings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; straightforward use of adb commands. The code relies on external 'run_command' to execute system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions that invoke system commands to manipulate device battery and display settings via adb shell. These commands can change the device's battery level, status, USB state, and screen resolution. The functions depend on external input parameters without validation, which could lead to unintended configuration if misused, but do not inherently perform malicious actions. The code does not contain any obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors like data exfiltration. The usage pattern appears to be for device management or testing purposes. No signs of malware, such as network exfiltration or unauthorized access, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs device configuration adjustments using adb commands, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is a straightforward utility code likely used for device testing or setup, but lacks input validation which could lead to misuse. Overall, the code appears benign and does not pose security risks.",
