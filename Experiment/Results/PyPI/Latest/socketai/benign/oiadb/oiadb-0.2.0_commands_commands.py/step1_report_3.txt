  "purpose": "The code provides functions to control device hardware parameters such as battery level, battery status, USB state, and screen resolution via adb commands.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (level, status, n, res)",
  "sinks": "Run_command function executing adb shell commands that modify device state",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> run_command with adb shell commands that alter device configuration",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of adb shell commands is typical for device management but can be malicious if misused. No signs of data exfiltration or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions to modify device battery and display settings by executing adb commands. The commands set battery level, status, reset battery, configure USB mode, and change screen resolution. The functions accept parameters directly from callers, which are incorporated into shell commands. These commands are generally used for testing, debugging, or device management. There are no indicators of malicious intent, such as network communication to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. However, if used maliciously, these functions could be part of a script to manipulate device states.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility set for device configuration via adb commands. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident from this code fragment. Its potential for misuse depends on the context in which it is deployed but, as-is, it is not malicious.",
