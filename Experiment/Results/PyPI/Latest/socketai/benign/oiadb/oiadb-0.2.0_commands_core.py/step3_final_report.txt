{
  "purpose": "Executes a shell command provided as a string and returns its output or error message.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'command' passed to run_command function.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run call executing the command, which can lead to command injection if input is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input 'command' flows directly into subprocess.run with shell=True, leading to execution of the command string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shell=True without input validation or sanitization; straightforward code with no obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code executes arbitrary shell commands via subprocess.run with shell=True, which is inherently risky if 'command' is untrusted. No validation or sanitization is performed, making it vulnerable to command injection. The code structure is simple and clear, with no obfuscation or malware. The security concern is significant, as malicious input could lead to arbitrary code execution. Malware score is low (0), as there's no evidence of malicious payloads. The risk score is high (~0.9), justified by the potential for exploitation. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9), given the straightforward nature of the vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but poses a serious security risk due to command injection vulnerability when handling untrusted input. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is absent, but the security risk is high. Proper mitigation involves avoiding shell=True or sanitizing inputs before execution.",
