  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but poses a serious security risk due to command injection vulnerability when handling untrusted input. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is absent, but the security risk is high. Proper mitigation involves avoiding shell=True or sanitizing inputs before execution."
