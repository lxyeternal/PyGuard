{
  "purpose": "To execute a system command provided as a string input and return its output or error message.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'command' is a source where untrusted data can be introduced.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run call with shell=True executes system commands, which can be exploited if 'command' is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input 'command' flows directly into subprocess.run, potentially executing malicious commands if input is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shell=True can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. No input validation or sanitization is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that takes a command string and executes it via subprocess.run with shell=True, which can run arbitrary commands. Since 'command' is an external input without validation, malicious input could lead to command injection. The try-except block captures exceptions but does not mitigate risks associated with malicious command execution. No other suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code allows execution of arbitrary commands provided by untrusted input, presenting a significant security risk. It is vulnerable to command injection attacks if the input is malicious. The use of shell=True amplifies this risk.",
