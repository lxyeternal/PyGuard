  "purpose": "Execute a shell command and return its output or error message.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'command' provided to run_command function.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run call executing the provided command string.",
  "flows": "Input 'command' → subprocess.run with shell=True → execution of arbitrary shell commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'shell=True' with untrusted input is a security concern; no input validation or sanitization shown.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that executes a command string via subprocess.run with shell=True, capturing the output. The use of shell=True allows for execution of arbitrary shell commands, which can be dangerous if the input is not sanitized or validated. No checks are present to restrict or verify the command input. The try-except block captures exceptions, but does not mitigate the security risk associated with executing untrusted commands. Overall, this pattern can lead to command injection if used improperly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is potentially malicious if the 'command' input is untrusted, as it allows execution of arbitrary shell commands. Without input validation or restrictions, it poses a significant security risk. The use of shell=True is the primary concern.",
