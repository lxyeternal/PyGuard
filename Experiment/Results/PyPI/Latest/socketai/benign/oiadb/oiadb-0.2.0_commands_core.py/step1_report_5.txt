{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to execute a shell command and return its output or error message.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'command' parameter provided when the function is called.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run call executes the command, which can lead to command execution vulnerabilities if the input is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input 'command' -> subprocess.run with shell=True -> command execution (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'shell=True' with untrusted input can allow command injection; no input validation or sanitization is present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple wrapper around subprocess.run for executing shell commands. It captures output and exceptions. The critical concern is the direct use of the 'command' parameter with 'shell=True', which can execute arbitrary commands if user input is passed without validation. No other malicious or suspicious code constructs are present. The function does not perform any hidden actions or contain obfuscation, but the potential for command injection is high if misused.",
  "conclusion": "This code can be dangerous if 'run_command' is called with untrusted input, as it allows arbitrary command execution via shell injection. It poses a significant security risk in such cases.",
