  "purpose": "Provides a function to execute shell commands and capture their output.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'command' provided to run_command function.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run with shell=True, which executes the command string in the shell environment.",
  "flows": "Input command -> subprocess.run -> command executed in shell environment.",
  "anomalies": "Uses shell=True which can lead to command injection if input is untrusted; no input validation or sanitization present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that executes a string command in the shell via subprocess.run with shell=True. This allows for dynamic command execution, which is inherently risky if command input is untrusted. There is no validation or sanitization of the input 'command'. The exception handling captures errors but does not mitigate security risks. The use of shell=True without input validation is a common source of command injection vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code allows execution of arbitrary shell commands, which can be exploited if the input is untrusted. The primary security concern is the use of shell=True without safeguards, making it potentially dangerous in environments accepting user input.",
