  "purpose": "Execute a shell command passed as a string and return its output or error message.",
  "sources": "The 'command' parameter received by run_command function; subprocess.run with 'shell=True'.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run executing shell commands, which can lead to command injection if untrusted input is used.",
  "flows": "Untrusted 'command' input flows directly into subprocess.run, executing potentially malicious commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'shell=True' without sanitizing input increases risk of command injection; no input validation or sanitization present.",
  "analysis": "The function accepts a string 'command' and executes it using subprocess.run with 'shell=True', which allows the command string to be executed directly by the shell. This presents a significant security risk if 'command' includes untrusted or malicious input, as it can lead to command injection. No validation, sanitization, or restrictions are in place. The code is straightforward but potentially dangerous in contexts where 'command' originates from user input. The exception handling merely captures errors but does not mitigate the security issue inherent in executing arbitrary commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code has a high security risk due to the use of 'shell=True' with untrusted input, making it susceptible to command injection attacks. It lacks safeguards against malicious input, representing a security concern for any deployment accepting external input.",
