  "purpose": "A CLI interface for the Karhu AI Assistant that manages models, context, speech, and executes commands via an external command processor.",
  "sources": "User command-line arguments, file paths, URLs, and direct user queries",
  "sinks": "CommandProcessor.process_command function, context updates, TTS output, file saving",
  "flows": "Input arguments are processed and passed to command processor functions; responses are displayed or spoken; context is saved or modified based on commands",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or hidden backdoors; reliance on external command processing without internal validation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI front-end that delegates core command execution to an external 'CommandProcessor'. It handles user inputs, manages models, context, and TTS settings, and calls command functions based on CLI flags. No malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The security depends on the implementation of 'CommandProcessor.process_command', which is not provided. The code structure and external libraries are standard, and no suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and safe, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary security concern is the external command processing function, which should be validated and sanitized. Based on the provided code, the malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The reports' assessments are consistent with this analysis.",
