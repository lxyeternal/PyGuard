  "purpose": "The code provides functions to display a help menu and a banner for an AI assistant, listing commands and showing information.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reads are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; the code primarily outputs static text and colored terminal output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not process or execute user input directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes with methods that output predefined, formatted text to the console. The use of 'colored' for output is a standard terminal coloring library. There are no external data inputs, no user input processing, and no network operations or system modifications. All functions serve informational purposes. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful payloads is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility for displaying help information and banners for an AI assistant. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be purely for user interface presentation without security risks.",
