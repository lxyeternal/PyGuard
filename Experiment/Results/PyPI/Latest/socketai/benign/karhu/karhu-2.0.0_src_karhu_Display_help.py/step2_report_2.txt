  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is purely for display purposes—printing static menus and banners with no user input processing, network activity, or data manipulation. The code is straightforward and uses only standard libraries (`termcolor`) for formatting.  \n   **Conclusion**: There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no suspicious activity. They do not identify any logical flaws or security issues.  \n   **Note**: The reasoning is consistent and well-founded based on the code provided.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. The obfuscated score is also 0, indicating no obfuscation.  \n   **Suggestion**: These scores seem appropriate given the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely for UI display, no dynamic input, network activity, or data processing occurs. Therefore, a high risk score would be unjustified.  \n   **Conclusion**: Risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious code or behavior.  \n   **Note**: No changes needed here.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static and controlled nature of the code.  \n   **Note**: No challenge necessary.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code content and the analyses.  \n   **Overall**: The assessments are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Rationale**: The code is a benign, static UI display module with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic execution. All evidence indicates it poses no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion**: No changes needed. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
