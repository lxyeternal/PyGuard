  "purpose": "The code provides a user interface for an AI assistant, displaying commands and a banner.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static command definitions and display functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; display functions do not process untrusted input or data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hidden backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unsafe operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static display functions for command menus and a banner, using standard print statements and the 'termcolor' library for colored output. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations. The functions are purely presentational. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No indication of code injection, data leaks, or privacy violations. The code structure is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign and purely for display purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this module.",
