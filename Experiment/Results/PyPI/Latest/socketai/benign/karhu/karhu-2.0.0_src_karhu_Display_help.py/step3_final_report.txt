  "purpose": "Display static help commands and banner information for the AI assistant interface.",
  "sources": "Static print statements, class methods, and variables used for display; no external data input or network activity.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "Method calls trigger print statements; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and uses standard libraries for display purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines UI display functions with static content, relying on the 'termcolor' library for colored output. It does not process user input, handle data, or perform network operations. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The functions serve purely for visual presentation, with no dynamic or external data handling involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely for UI display, with no malicious or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are accurate and appropriate given the static, safe nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
