{
  "purpose": "The code provides a user interface for an AI assistant, displaying commands and a banner, primarily for user interaction.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; methods are static and only print static or formatted text.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations; all outputs are safe print statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; functions are solely for display purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden functionalities. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static methods that print formatted command lists and banner information. It uses only predefined data and the 'colored' library for formatting output. There are no input sources, external data processing, or network activities. The functions do not handle user input, do not perform file operations, nor execute commands dynamically. The structure and content are consistent with typical UI display code. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward display interface with no malicious or security risks. It functions solely for outputting static information to the console, with no suspicious or harmful elements.",
