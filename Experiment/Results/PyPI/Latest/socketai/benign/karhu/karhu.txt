      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a push-to-talk speech interface with environment-based disablement. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The environment variable toggle is a benign feature control, not a security concern. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."

      "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured TTS implementation with environment-based disablement, platform-specific playback, and text sanitization. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain issues are evident. The low risk score reflects standard subprocess usage, which should be monitored but is not inherently dangerous."

      "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and safe, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary security concern is the external command processing function, which should be validated and sanitized. Based on the provided code, the malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The reports' assessments are consistent with this analysis."
