  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured TTS implementation with environment-based disablement, platform-specific playback, and text sanitization. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain issues are evident. The low risk score reflects standard subprocess usage, which should be monitored but is not inherently dangerous."
