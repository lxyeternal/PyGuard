{
  "purpose": "To load and parse configuration files in JSON or YAML format and retrieve specific profile data.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration files from disk based on filename extension; input is the filename provided during class instantiation and method arguments.",
  "sinks": "Returning parsed configuration data; printing error messages and profile existence notifications to the console.",
  "flows": "Constructor calls load_config() to read from disk; get_profile() accesses self.config_data and profiles; prints messages based on profile existence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code constructs; standard library functions used appropriately; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration data from disk using standard Python libraries json and yaml, based on file extension. It handles exceptions during file loading and prints error messages. The get_profile method retrieves profile data safely, with no evident data leakage or malicious activity. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external network communication. The use of print and colored for messaging is benign. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward configuration loader without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard configuration loading and retrieval with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks. It is a typical implementation with safe practices, and there is no evidence of malware or suspicious activity.",
