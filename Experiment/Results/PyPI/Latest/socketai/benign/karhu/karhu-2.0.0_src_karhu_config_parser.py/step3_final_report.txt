  "purpose": "Load configuration data from JSON or YAML files and retrieve specific profiles by name.",
  "sources": "Reading from configuration files with open(), json.load(), yaml.safe_load(); input profile_name parameter.",
  "sinks": "Returning profile data; printing error messages and profile existence notifications.",
  "flows": "Input profile_name -> strip() -> config_data.get('profiles') -> profile lookup -> return profile data or empty dict.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard libraries and practices; no suspicious code constructs or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration parser that loads data from JSON or YAML files, with error handling and input sanitization. It retrieves profiles by name, providing feedback if not found. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behaviors are present. Use of safe parsing methods and minimal input sanitization indicates a benign, well-implemented utility. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration loader with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: approximately 0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
