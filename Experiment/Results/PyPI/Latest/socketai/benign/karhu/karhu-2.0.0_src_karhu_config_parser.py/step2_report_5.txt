  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward configuration loader and profile retriever.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.\n- The code uses standard libraries (`json`, `yaml`, `termcolor`) appropriately.\n- Error handling is basic but sufficient.\n- No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are observed.\n- The code reads configuration files based on extension, retrieves profiles, and prints messages accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description in all reports.\n- No issues are present in the code that would suggest malicious activity or security risks.\n- The code's purpose, flow, and implementation are standard and benign.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- Error handling is simple but adequate.\n- Input sanitization via `strip()` is good practice.\n- No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (0 or 0.1). The only minor point is that loading external files could be misused if malicious files are provided, but this is outside the code's control and not an inherent flaw.\n\n### Potential Adjustments:\n- The security risk score could be slightly increased to 0.2 or 0.3, considering that if untrusted configuration files are supplied, they could contain malicious content (e.g., malicious YAML with anchors or other features). However, given the code's current handling (using `json.load()` and `yaml.safe_load()`), this risk is minimal.\n- Since no malicious activity is detected, and the code uses safe parsing methods, the current scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, mostly due to external file loading considerations)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a standard, benign configuration loader with safe practices. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (acceptable, considering external file handling, but minimal)\n\n**Final note:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose.",
