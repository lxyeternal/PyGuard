  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a push-to-talk speech interface with environment-based disablement. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The environment variable toggle is a benign feature control, not a security concern. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."
