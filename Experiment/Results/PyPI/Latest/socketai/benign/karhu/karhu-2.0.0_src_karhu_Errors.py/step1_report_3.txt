{
  "purpose": "The code provides error handling and formatting functionalities for rate limit errors and general error logging in an application.",
  "sources": "Error message inputs in format_error_rate_limit_error and log_error methods, exception objects passed as arguments.",
  "sinks": "Console output via print statements, displaying formatted error messages and exception details.",
  "flows": "Error messages or exception objects are passed into functions -> functions process and format these messages -> output to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code primarily performs string parsing, formatting, and printing.",
  "analysis": "The code uses regex to extract wait time from error messages, formats this into human-readable form, and logs errors via console output. There are no suspicious data flows, network activities, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is present. The only notable aspect is simple string manipulation and logging, which are benign activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard error handling and formatting logic without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not include any malicious activities such as data theft, network communications, or backdoors.",
