{
  "purpose": "The code handles error formatting, logging, and display for application errors, specifically rate limit errors and general exceptions.",
  "sources": "Input data is from error messages (error_message parameter), and optional exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted error messages to the console via print statements, potentially exposing sensitive info if error messages contain sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input error_message flows into formatting and logging functions; exceptions may be passed for detailed logs and displayed in yellow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors. The code uses regex to parse error messages, which is standard. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard error formatting, logging, and display. It extracts time information from error messages using regex, formats it for user readability, and outputs messages with colored formatting. Error logging is via print statements, and exceptions are optionally printed. No external data or network interactions are present. There are no anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward error handling utility with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It simply formats, logs, and displays error messages for application errors.",
