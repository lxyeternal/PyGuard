  "purpose": "The code provides error handling and formatting for rate limit errors and logging errors in an application.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from error messages (error_message argument) and exception objects passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs error messages and details to the console using print statements; no data is sent over the network or stored persistently.",
  "flows": "Error message or exception flows into log_error or handle_error functions, which then output formatted error information to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The code performs straightforward error handling and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports re for pattern matching and termcolor for colored console output. It defines an Errors class with methods to format rate limit errors based on seconds extracted from messages and to log or handle errors. The rate limit error formatting involves converting seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds, then constructing a human-readable message. Logging functions output messages with colored formatting. There is no input from untrusted sources that influences the logic beyond error message parsing, nor does the code perform any network operations or data exfiltration. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error handling utility with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears to be safe and solely intended for error formatting and logging.",
