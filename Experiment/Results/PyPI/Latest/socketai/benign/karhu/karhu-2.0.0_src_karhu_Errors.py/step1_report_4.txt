{
  "purpose": "The code provides error handling and formatting functions for rate limit errors and general error logging in an application.",
  "sources": "Input is from error_message arguments passed to methods; exception objects in optional parameters.",
  "sinks": "Formatted error messages printed to the console, potentially exposing sensitive information if error messages contain secrets.",
  "flows": "Error message or exception input flows into log_error or handle_error methods, leading to formatted console output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. No use of network or external data access. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code handles errors by parsing error messages, particularly extracting wait times from rate limit errors. It formats these messages for user readability and logs errors with colored terminal output. The methods are straightforward, involving regex parsing, string formatting, and printing. No external data access, network activity, or secret management is present. The functions do not perform any malicious operations, nor do they contain hidden backdoors or suspicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for error handling and formatting, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and intended for user-facing error display and logging.",
