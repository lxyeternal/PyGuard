{
  "purpose": "The code provides error formatting and logging utilities, specifically parsing rate limit error messages to produce human-readable wait times and printing error messages with optional exception details.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from error_message parameters in format_rate_limit_error and error_message in log_error/handle_error functions.",
  "sinks": "Printed output to console via print statements, displaying error messages and formatted wait times.",
  "flows": "Error message input → regex parsing in format_rate_limit_error → formatted string → printed to console; exception object → optional string conversion → printed to console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward regex parsing, standard print statements, no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility for error message formatting and logging. It uses regex to extract wait times from error messages, formats them into human-readable strings, and prints error messages with colored output. No network activity, data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. The logic is correct and robust. The only potential concern is that error messages are printed directly, which could expose sensitive info if error messages contain secrets, but this is a common logging practice. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward error handling utility with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It performs standard error formatting and logging, with no suspicious or malicious elements detected.",
