{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to handle and format error messages, specifically rate limit errors, and to log errors with optional exception details.",
  "sources": "Input sources include error_message parameters passed to format_rate_limit_error, log_error, and handle_error functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are console prints of formatted error messages via the print function, with no external or system side effects.",
  "flows": "Input error_message flows through formatting functions and then is outputted to the console; exception objects, if provided, are also printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code uses regex for parsing and formatted printing; nothing unusual or obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for error handling with methods to format rate limit errors into human-readable strings and to log errors with optional exception details. It uses regex to extract wait times from error messages and formats the wait time for clarity. Error logging is performed via console printing with colored output. There are no external network calls, no suspicious data handling, or obfuscated behaviors. The code appears standard and safe, intended solely for error management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward error handling utility with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
