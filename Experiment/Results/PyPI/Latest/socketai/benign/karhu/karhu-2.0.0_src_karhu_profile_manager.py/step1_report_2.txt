  "purpose": "Manage system prompt profiles for an assistant, including creating, retrieving, and setting profiles stored in a JSON configuration file.",
  "sources": "Reads from and writes to 'config/profiles.json' based on class methods, including file existence checks, JSON loading, and JSON dumping.",
  "sinks": "File operations for reading and writing profile data; potential for data corruption or misuse if the file path or content is manipulated externally.",
  "flows": "Methods read the JSON file to retrieve profiles or current profile; modify in-memory data; then write back to the same file. 'set_current_profile' and 'add_profile' modify data and save changes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Use of exception handling for file operations is standard. No hardcoded secrets beyond default profiles, which are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code manages profile data stored in a JSON file. It creates default profiles if none exist, reads profile data, updates current profile, and adds new profiles. All file paths are constructed based on the script's directory, preventing arbitrary file access. Exception handling is present but only logs errors or silently defaults to safe values. No network access, no use of external inputs other than filename/path, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate profile management functions with proper file handling and no indications of malicious intent. It appears safe and straightforward, with no malicious or backdoor behavior detected.",
