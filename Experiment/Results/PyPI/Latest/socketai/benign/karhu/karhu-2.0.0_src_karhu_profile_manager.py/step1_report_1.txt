  "purpose": "Manage system prompt profiles for an assistant, including creating, retrieving, updating, and setting profiles stored in a JSON file.",
  "sources": "Reading from profiles JSON file at various points (e.g., get_profiles, get_current_profile, set_current_profile, add_profile, create_profile, _create_default_profiles).",
  "sinks": "Writing to the profiles JSON file during profile creation, updates, and default profile setup.",
  "flows": "Code reads data from the profiles file and writes back updated data, especially during profile creation, modification, and default setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation. Uses standard JSON read/write operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles file I/O for JSON configuration management, with proper exception handling and default profile creation. No indication of malicious behavior, external network activity, or data exfiltration. The code's operations are straightforward and limited to managing local files. No use of untrusted inputs beyond profile names and prompts, which are handled as data inputs without dangerous evaluation. No signs of backdoors, credential theft, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard profile management utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It safely handles profile data with appropriate error handling and defaults. There are no indicators of malware or malicious behavior.",
