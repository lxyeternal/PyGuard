  "purpose": "Manage system prompt profiles stored in a JSON configuration file, allowing creation, retrieval, and modification of profiles for an assistant.",
  "sources": "File reads from 'config/profiles.json' during profile retrieval, creation, and updates.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; file operations are local and controlled.",
  "flows": "Source: Reading or writing to 'profiles.json'; Sink: Updating or retrieving profile data within the JSON file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with proper exception handling and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code manages local JSON configuration files for profiles, creating defaults if missing, and allowing updates. It employs safe path handling and exception management. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The logic is clear and standard, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads. Error handling is basic but not malicious. The static and class methods perform expected profile management tasks without external influence or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign profile management utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
