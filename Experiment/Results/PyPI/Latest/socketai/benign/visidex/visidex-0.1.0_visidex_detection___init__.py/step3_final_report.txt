{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing specific classes from local modules and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.rekd and .singular_point).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not handle external input or output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module setup, importing classes and defining __all__ for exports. It contains no data processing, external communication, dynamic code execution, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores reflecting no malicious intent or obfuscation. The code's simplicity and transparency support a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. Confidence is high (1.0), given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module initialization pattern with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the overall assessment confirms its safety.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
