  "purpose": "The code defines an API export for a module, indicating which classes are publicly accessible.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: '.rekd' and '.singular_point'. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling operations are present; the code only exports class names.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks, as this code only defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with simple class imports and export declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from local modules and declares an export list. There are no dynamic imports, code execution, or suspicious patterns. It appears to be standard Python module code, focusing solely on defining what symbols are publicly available.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module initializer that exports classes from local modules. There is no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risk present.",
