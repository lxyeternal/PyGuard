{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from local modules for use elsewhere, likely part of a larger package or library.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules ('rekd' and 'singular_point').",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; just imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two classes from sibling modules and defines the __all__ list for module exports. There are no input operations, network communications, or data processing. The imported modules are local, and no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It only handles imports and exports, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
