  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import and export statements, typical for module initialization or __init__.py files.\n- No reports mention any suspicious behavior, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero or near zero, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating strong agreement that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippets in all reports match the original code provided.\n- The code only imports classes from local modules and defines `__all__`.\n- No signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are evident.\n\n### Errors or Flaws:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No logical errors or flaws are present in the analysis.\n\n### Scores review:\n- The malware scores are all 0 or 0.1, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are 0 or very close to zero, aligning with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign scores > 0.5; all are appropriately low.\n- If any report had assigned higher scores, I would challenge them based on the code's simplicity.\n\n### Malware and obfuscation:\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or obfuscation.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is standard and safe.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The reports' conclusions are aligned with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard module export pattern with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent. The reports correctly identify this, and the scoring reflects the lack of security concerns.",
