{
  "purpose": "The code exports two classes, REKD and SingularPoints, likely for use in other modules or projects.",
  "sources": "Imports REKD from .rekd and SingularPoints from .singular_point within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; only module imports and exports are shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module import and export operations, establishing interface definitions. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors. No suspicious or unusual code structures observed. The simplicity and standard nature of this code imply low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export statement, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and serves to re-export classes from internal modules.",
