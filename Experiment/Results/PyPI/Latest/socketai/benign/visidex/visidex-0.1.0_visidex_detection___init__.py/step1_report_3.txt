{
  "purpose": "Defines the module exports for REKD and SingularPoints classes, likely part of a package's __init__.py to facilitate imports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules rekd and singular_point",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling or external outputs observed",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or sensitive data; just module import and export definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from local modules and defines an __all__ list for exports. No data input, external communication, or complex logic present. The code appears to be a standard module initialization file, facilitating controlled imports.\n\nNo signs of malicious behavior, malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module export declaration with no malicious or security concerns identified. It appears safe and typical for Python package structure.",
