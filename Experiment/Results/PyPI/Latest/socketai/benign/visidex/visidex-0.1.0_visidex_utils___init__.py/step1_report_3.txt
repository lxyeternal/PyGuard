{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .kernels and .download",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or perform data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the imports are static references",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports is typical in packages but not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions 'gaussian_multiple_channels' and 'load_model' from local modules. The use of __all__ indicates controlled export of these functions. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity is present. The code appears to be part of a module's __init__.py or similar setup. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initialization with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports functions from local modules, which is common in package design.",
