  "purpose": "Module setup importing functions from local modules and defining __all__ for export.",
  "sources": "Imports from .kernels and .download modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static import/export statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module interface, importing functions and exposing them via __all__. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are appropriate given the simplicity. The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks. The imported functions' contents are unknown, but based on this snippet alone, no vulnerabilities or malicious activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
