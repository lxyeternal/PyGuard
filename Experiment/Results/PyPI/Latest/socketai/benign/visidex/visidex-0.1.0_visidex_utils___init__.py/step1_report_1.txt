  "purpose": "Exporting functions 'gaussian_multiple_channels' and 'load_model' for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from local modules '.kernels' and '.download'.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or potentially vulnerable points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to sensitive operations; simply imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward module export setup with no unusual or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from local modules and defines an __all__ list for exports, which is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident. The imported functions' contents are unknown, but the current code does not include any suspicious operations itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module interface. No malware or security risks are detected based solely on this snippet.",
