{
  "purpose": "The code is exporting functions 'gaussian_multiple_channels' and 'load_model' for use elsewhere, likely as part of a package's API.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from local modules: 'kernels' and 'download'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions from other modules and exposes them via __all__, without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports two functions from local modules and declares them as publicly available. There is no data processing, user input handling, or network activity. The imports are from internal modules, and no malicious code or obfuscation is present. The simplicity and clarity suggest this is standard package export code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this minimal code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears to serve a typical purpose of exporting functions for external use.",
