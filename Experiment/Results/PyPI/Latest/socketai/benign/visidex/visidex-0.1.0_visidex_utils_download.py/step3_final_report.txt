  "purpose": "Load a PyTorch model instance, optionally downloading pretrained weights from a specified URL with hash verification.",
  "sources": "The URL parameter 'weights_url' used in torch.hub.load_state_dict_from_url for downloading weights.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded weights loaded into the model; no direct untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input: 'weights_url' parameter → torch.hub.load_state_dict_from_url → model.load_state_dict",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard PyTorch API. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a model instance, optionally downloads weights from an external URL with hash verification, loads the weights into the model, sets it to evaluation mode, and returns it. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of the external URL, which cannot be assessed statically. The use of 'check_hash=True' indicates good security practice. The code is clear, standard, and safe, with no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign model loader with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main risk stems from trusting the external URL for weights, which is outside static analysis scope. Malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.2.",
