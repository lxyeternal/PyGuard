  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network communication, system info collection, dynamic code execution (eval), hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, data leaks via environment variables, system info, potential code injection points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into network functions or eval, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, eval usage, hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, dynamic code execution, and unusual variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which raise suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent. No explicit malicious payloads or harmful actions are observed. The code's purpose appears to be system info collection and network communication, which are common but can be exploited if connected to malicious endpoints. The suspicious patterns justify moderate scores for obfuscation and malware, with low to moderate security risk. The overall confidence is high given the evidence, and the structure indicates cautious assessment rather than definitive malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which warrant caution but do not confirm malicious activity. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the observed patterns. No definitive malicious payloads are present, but the obfuscation and eval usage justify a moderate malware and security risk score.",
