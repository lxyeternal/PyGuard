  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging a Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata defined in setup(), including name, version, description, author info, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports setuptools and calls setup() with predefined, static metadata. All reports correctly identify that the code contains no dynamic behavior, external input handling, or network activity. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the script. No logical errors or vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is solely to define package metadata, and it does so without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
