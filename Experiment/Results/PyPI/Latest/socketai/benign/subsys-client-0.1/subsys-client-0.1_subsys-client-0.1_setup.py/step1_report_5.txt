  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the 'subsys-client' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, author info, and package discovery using find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows or untrusted input handling; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward package setup script.",
  "analysis": "This setup.py script is a standard configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata and dependencies without executing any external commands or processing untrusted input. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. The code does not include network operations, credential handling, or data leakage mechanisms. It appears to be a legitimate package setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
