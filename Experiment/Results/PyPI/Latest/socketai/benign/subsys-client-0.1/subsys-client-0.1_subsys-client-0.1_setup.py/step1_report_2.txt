  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'subsys-client' Python package, including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains static configuration data and package setup instructions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as the code is purely declarative setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard package setup script with no unusual or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package metadata (name, version, description, author info), and uses find_packages() to locate packages. No dynamic code, user input handling, or environment variable usage. No hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code aligns with standard Python package setup conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a typical package configuration file with no malicious or suspicious content. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
