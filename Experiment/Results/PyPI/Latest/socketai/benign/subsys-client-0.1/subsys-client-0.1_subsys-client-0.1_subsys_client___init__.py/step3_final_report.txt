{
  "purpose": "A minimal Python module initialization that prints 'hello' when imported or executed.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple print statement with no input handling, network communication, or data processing. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive elements. The code's purpose appears to be for basic module initialization or a placeholder. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code poses no security threat and is consistent across analyses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
