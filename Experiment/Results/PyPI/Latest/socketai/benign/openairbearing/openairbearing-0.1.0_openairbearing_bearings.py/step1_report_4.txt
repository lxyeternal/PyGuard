{
  "purpose": "Defines various classes for different bearing types with parameters and initialization methods, primarily used for simulation or modeling of bearing systems.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy, dataclasses, and openairbearing.utils for functions like get_area, get_geom, get_kappa, get_beta. Uses class attributes and __post_init__ methods to initialize parameters.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data. No network, file, or external system access, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Class attributes initialized from input parameters, with some calculations during __post_init__ methods. No flow from external untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious variable naming. Commented-out plotting code appears to be for debugging or visualization, not malicious. Hardcoded constants appear legitimate for modeling parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines data classes for various types of bearings, initializing parameters and geometric calculations. The import of external utility functions (get_area, get_geom, get_kappa, get_beta) is standard. No code injection, network operations, or suspicious behaviors detected. No use of untrusted input sources, no hardcoded credentials, and no malicious code snippets are present. The only minor concern is commented-out plotting code, which is harmless but could indicate prior debugging. Overall, the code appears to be purely functional for modeling purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data classes modeling different bearing types with parameter initialization, involving no suspicious or malicious behavior. No malware, external data exfiltration, or sabotage identified. It is a benign modeling library component.",
