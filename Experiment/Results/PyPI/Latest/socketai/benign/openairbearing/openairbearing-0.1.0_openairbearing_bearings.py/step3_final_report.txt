{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for various bearing types, initializing parameters and computing geometric attributes for mechanical modeling purposes.",
  "sources": "Parameters set during class initialization, external utility functions (get_area, get_geom, get_kappa, get_beta) called in __post_init__.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network activity, or data leaks; geometric calculations are internal and deterministic.",
  "flows": "Class parameter setup → utility function calls → geometric attribute assignments; no external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors; commented-out plotting code is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data classes for different bearing types, primarily setting parameters and performing geometric calculations via utility functions. No external data fetching, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is straightforward, domain-specific, and uses standard Python practices. Utility functions are assumed safe. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. Commented-out plotting code is benign. The structure and content are consistent across reports, all indicating a benign, modeling-focused codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, domain-specific modeling library for bearings with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is clear, well-structured, and safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting its purpose as a geometric modeling tool without security concerns.",
