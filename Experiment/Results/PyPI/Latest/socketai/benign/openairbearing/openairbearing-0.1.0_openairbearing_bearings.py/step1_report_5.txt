{
  "purpose": "Define various classes for different types of bearings, including their properties and initialization behaviors.",
  "sources": "Imports from openairbearing.utils, class attribute definitions, __post_init__ methods, and calculations within __post_init__.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, but numpy array calculations and attribute assignments are present.",
  "flows": "Initialization functions call external utility functions (get_area, get_geom, get_kappa, get_beta) to compute geometric and physical parameters based on class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code primarily performs geometry and parameter setup. Commented-out plotting code is benign and for visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple data classes for various bearing types, initializing parameters and geometries. The __post_init__ methods compute geometrical and physical properties, with calls to external utility functions. There are no indications of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. All calculations appear to be domain-specific setup routines. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of bearing classes for simulation purposes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The utility functions are assumed to perform geometric calculations securely. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
