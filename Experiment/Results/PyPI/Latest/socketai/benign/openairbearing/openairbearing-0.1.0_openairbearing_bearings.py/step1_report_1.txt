  "purpose": "Define various bearing classes with specific parameters and geometric calculations for mechanical simulations.",
  "sources": "Imports from openairbearing.utils (get_area, get_geom, get_kappa, get_beta), attribute initializations, and numpy array computations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; code mainly initializes data structures and computes geometric parameters.",
  "flows": "Initialization methods call utility functions (get_geom, get_kappa, get_beta) that may process data, but no external data flows or untrusted input handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code predominantly defines data classes with geometric calculations. Commented-out plotting code is benign. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or malicious system access observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple data classes inheriting from BaseBearing, setting parameters for different bearing types. It uses standard Python practices, numpy for numerical arrays, and utility functions likely for geometric calculations. No input validation, external data fetching, or network activity present. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden backdoors. Utility functions are imported but not shown; assuming they perform standard geometric computations. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation of bearing data structures with geometric parameter calculations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
