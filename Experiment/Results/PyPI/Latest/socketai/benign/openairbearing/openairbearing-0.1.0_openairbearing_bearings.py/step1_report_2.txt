{
  "purpose": "Define various classes for different bearing types with geometric and physical parameters for simulation or analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements for numpy and utility functions; class attributes initialized with constants and parameters; method calls to get_area, get_geom, get_kappa, get_beta during post-initialization.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no functions or code segments are actively processing untrusted input or performing unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Initialization of class attributes and calls to utility functions during __post_init__, which depend on class attributes; no data flows from external sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual dynamic code execution; the code primarily consists of class definitions and parameter calculations. The only notable calculation is in 'clearance' for 'JournalBearing', but it appears to be standard geometric computation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for different types of bearings, each initializing parameters and geometries for simulation purposes. It uses numpy for numerical computations and external utility functions likely related to geometry. There are no signs of malicious code such as network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The calculations appear to be standard for geometric modeling of bearings. No hardcoded sensitive data, external code injection, or obfuscated logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of bearing models with no malicious intent. It uses standard scientific computing practices and utility functions for geometric calculations. There are no indications of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
