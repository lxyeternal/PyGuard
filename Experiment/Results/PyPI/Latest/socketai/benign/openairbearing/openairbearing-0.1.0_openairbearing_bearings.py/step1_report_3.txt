  "purpose": "Define various classes representing different types of bearings with associated parameters and initializations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for numpy and openairbearing.utils; class attribute initializations; get_area, get_geom, get_kappa, get_beta function calls; attribute calculations in __post_init__ methods.",
  "sinks": "None directly, as the code mainly initializes parameters and calls functions; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Class instantiations trigger __post_init__ methods that compute geometrical and physical parameters using utility functions and attribute values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of numpy.linspace and np.gradient with standard parameters; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious string operations or dynamic code execution; commented-out plotting code is benign; no obfuscated patterns or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for various bearing types with attributes for physical parameters. It computes geometrical data during initialization using external utility functions. No suspicious data handling or malicious operations are present. The functions imported from 'openairbearing.utils' are not detailed here, but assuming they are standard utility functions, their usage appears consistent with normal modeling tasks. The only unusual aspect is the commented-out matplotlib code, which is harmless. Overall, the code is straightforward and primarily performs parameter setup and geometric calculations without any evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of bearing models for simulation or analysis, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not contain any malware, suspicious data leaks, or malicious external connections. The structure and content indicate legitimate engineering computation code.",
