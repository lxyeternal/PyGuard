{
  "purpose": "This code defines the layout and interface components for a web application related to open air bearing analysis, including input controls, result visualizations, and styling.",
  "sources": "The code reads user inputs from various dcc.Input and dcc.Dropdown components; configuration constants like DEMO_MODE; and static assets like favicon.ico.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data flows include user input data that could be used in calculations or transmitted; but there are no evident data leaks, network connections, or data exfiltration code.",
  "flows": "User inputs from HTML components are intended to be processed by the app backend; however, no explicit data flow or untrusted data processing logic is present in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code behaviors are observed. No suspicious code structures or obfuscated parts are present. The code is predominantly layout and UI setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily UI layout with styling and component creation, utilizing standard Dash components. It imports functions for plotting and configuration flags, but no code executes any network or file operations, nor contains code that could be malicious. The only potential concern might be the use of default input values, but these are typical default parameters. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard layout setup for a web app with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not include any network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoor code. The implementation is focused on UI components and plotting for a bearing analysis application.",
