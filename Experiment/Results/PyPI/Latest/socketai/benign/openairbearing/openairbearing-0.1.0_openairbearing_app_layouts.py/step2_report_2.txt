  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes UI layout for a bearing analysis app, using user inputs and external plotting functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transmission; inputs are processed internally.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior. The code is purely UI setup.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded; no malware or security risks identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; constructs UI for bearing simulation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication; visualization only.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, straightforward layout code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, UI layout for a bearing app.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transmission; visualization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, standard Dash layout.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate; no security concerns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar UI construction.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** UI for a bearing analysis dashboard.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, straightforward layout.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified; no security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely for UI layout, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external communication.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in most reports, reflecting minimal security risk, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, correct.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 is reasonable given the UI code; no significant security risk detected.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to the complexity of user inputs and external dependencies, but no real threat)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No changes are necessary. The code appears safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
