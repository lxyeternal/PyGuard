  "purpose": "Constructs a web app layout for a bearing analysis tool using Dash components, including input controls, styling, and plotting areas.",
  "sources": "User input components (Dropdowns, Inputs, Checklists, Buttons), external plotting functions (plot_bearing_shape, plot_key_results, empty_figure), assets (favicon.ico).",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or file I/O; purely UI rendering.",
  "flows": "User inputs collected via UI components are used internally; no external data flows or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Dash layout setup for a web app, importing plotting functions and configuration flags. It creates input controls, styling, and plot sections without any network calls, file operations, or code execution beyond UI rendering. No obfuscation or secrets are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a UI layout for a web app with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, reflecting minimal security concern.",
