{
  "purpose": "The code constructs a web application's layout for an Open Air Bearing simulation interface, including input forms, controls, and result visualizations using Dash and Plotly.",
  "sources": "Input data from user interface components such as dcc.Input, dcc.Dropdown, and dcc.Checklist; data from default_bearing object.",
  "sinks": "Data passed to plotting functions (plot_bearing_shape, plot_key_results); visualization of results. No data is sent externally.",
  "flows": "User interactions (changing inputs, resetting) flow from input components to internal handlers; plot functions generate visualizations based on these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The style dictionaries are standard. No network calls, file I/O, or system modifications present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely generates a web interface layout with inputs, buttons, and plots for a mechanical simulation tool. It uses standard Dash components and styling. There are no dynamic code executions, data transmissions, or external system interactions. The functions create layout elements and invoke plotting functions with inputs, all of which are typical for web dashboards. The code is well-structured and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward layout definition for a web app with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only manages user interface components and visualizations without external communications or hidden functionalities.",
