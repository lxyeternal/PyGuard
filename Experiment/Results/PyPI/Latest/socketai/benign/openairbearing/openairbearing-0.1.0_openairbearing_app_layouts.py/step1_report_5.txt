{
  "purpose": "The code constructs a web application layout for an open-source dashboard related to bearing analysis, providing input controls and visualizations.",
  "sources": "Inputs include user-controlled form elements such as dropdowns, number inputs, and buttons; data is read from default_bearing parameters and user interactions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that could leak data or execute untrusted code; no system commands, network calls, or data exfiltration observed within this code.",
  "flows": "User input from dropdowns, checklists, and input fields could influence the visualizations and computations; however, the code only sets up the layout and does not perform data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden functionalities. The code adheres to typical UI construction practices. Commented-out code does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to generate a structured web interface with input controls and plots, primarily for visualization purposes. It imports external plotting functions and configuration flags. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or other malicious behaviors. All data handling appears confined to the application scope. The inputs and layout are standard, and no code injection vectors or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign layout construction script for a web dashboard, with no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It simply builds a UI with controlled inputs and plots, with no external data processing or communication implemented in this snippet.",
