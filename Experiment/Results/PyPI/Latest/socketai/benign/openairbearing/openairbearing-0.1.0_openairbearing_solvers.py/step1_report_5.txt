  "purpose": "This code implements pressure distribution calculations for bearings and seals using analytical and numerical methods, including finite difference schemes for 2D and 3D pressure solutions.",
  "sources": "Input data includes properties from the 'bearing' object (e.g., dimensions, pressure, geometry, material properties), and user-provided parameters such as 'soltype', 'ha', and 'ps'. The code reads these attributes and parameters to compute pressure and flow distributions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe data sinks include the use of untrusted input to modify the boundary conditions and the linear solver output which is used to generate pressure distributions; however, no external data is directly sent over networks or stored maliciously.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'bearing' object properties and input parameters through computational functions that generate pressure fields, which are then used to derive load capacities, stiffness, and volumetric flows. The pressure solutions flow into the Result object. No external data transmission or system modification occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code employs standard numerical methods and scientific libraries. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present. Boundary condition handling appears correct and typical for finite difference schemes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a scientific simulation for bearing and seal pressure distribution, employing well-established numerical techniques such as Bessel functions, exponential functions, and sparse matrix solutions. No unusual or malicious behavior, such as network calls, file manipulations, or hidden backdoors, is evident. The code uses trusted libraries (numpy, scipy) and handles boundary conditions carefully. The only potential concern is reliance on external 'bearing' object attributes, which must be validated for correctness, but this is standard practice in scientific code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific computation module without malicious intent. It relies on known mathematical and numerical methods for engineering calculations. No malware signals or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
