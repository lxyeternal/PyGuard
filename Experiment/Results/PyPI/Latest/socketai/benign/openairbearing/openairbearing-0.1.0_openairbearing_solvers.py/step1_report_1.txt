{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compute pressure distributions in bearings using analytical and numerical methods, including finite difference schemes for 2D pressure calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'bearing' object attributes, functions imported from 'openairbearing.utils', and internal calculations using numpy arrays and parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code performs numerical linear algebra operations, specifically solving sparse linear systems with 'spla.spsolve'. No external data or untrusted input is directly written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'bearing' object attributes into pressure calculation functions, then through finite difference matrices into linear solvers, resulting in pressure arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior observed. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are evident. The use of imported functions appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of bearing pressure analysis with analytical and finite difference numerical methods. It carefully handles boundary conditions, sparse matrix assembly, and pressure calculations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden backdoors are present. All external interactions are limited to numerical computations and linear algebra operations. The import of external libraries and internal function calls seem appropriate for the task. No unusual or suspicious code structures or dynamic code execution are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific computation module for bearing pressure analysis with no indicators of malicious intent. It strictly performs numerical calculations related to bearing physics, with no suspicious network or system actions.",
