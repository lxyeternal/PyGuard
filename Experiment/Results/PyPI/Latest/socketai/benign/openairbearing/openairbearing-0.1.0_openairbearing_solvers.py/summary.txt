  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific computation module for bearing pressure analysis. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to potential implementation bugs rather than security concerns."
