{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for plotting functions related to bearing analysis, primarily for visualization and validation of plot outputs.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pytest', 'numpy', and specific functions and classes from 'openairbearing' and 'plotly.graph_objects'. No external data input sources are evident in the active code; commented code references mock data generation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to untrusted sources are present. The code generates plotly figures locally for testing purposes.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves creating mock bearing objects and results, then calling plotting functions which generate plotly figures. There are no data flows from external untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive commented-out sections, but no evidence of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of test functions designed for visual verification of plotting functions. It imports necessary modules, defines mock data within comments, and calls plotting functions with these mocks. There are no external data reads, no network calls, and no system modifications. The code appears straightforward, with standard test structure and no suspicious behavior. The commented sections suggest planned tests but do not introduce any malicious code. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite for plotting functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely within the testing environment, generating figures for validation purposes. Overall, it is safe and lacks malicious or maliciously obfuscated content.",
