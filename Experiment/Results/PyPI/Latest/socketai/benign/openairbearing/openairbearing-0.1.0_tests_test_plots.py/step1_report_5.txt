{
  "purpose": "This code contains test functions for plotting functions in the openairbearing package, specifically testing visualization of bearing results and shapes.",
  "sources": "It imports data from openairbearing modules and generates mock data internally for testing.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or sent to external systems; the code mainly creates figures using Plotly.",
  "flows": "Mock data is generated internally and passed to plotting functions; no untrusted external input flows into sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "All code appears to be standard testing and plotting code with no suspicious or unusual operations, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no external communications.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of commented-out test functions designed to test visualization functions of the openairbearing package. It uses standard Python imports, creates mock data, and calls plotting functions that generate Plotly figures. There are no external inputs or network operations, no data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code is straightforward, intended solely for testing visualization components, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard testing code for visualization functions, with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
