{
  "purpose": "This code contains test functions for plotting functions in the openairbearing package, primarily used for unit testing visualization routines.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest, numpy, openairbearing, and plotly; commented-out code sections with mock data creation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that process untrusted input data; no network, file I/O, or sensitive data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "The code creates mock data for plotting functions and calls plotting functions that generate Plotly figures, but does not process external untrusted input at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of test functions (currently commented out) intended for plotting utilities within a visualization module. These functions generate mock data using numpy, invoke plotting functions from openairbearing, and perform assertions on the generated Plotly figures. No external data input handling, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be standard unit testing scaffolding with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of test functions for plotting routines, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The code does not process external untrusted data in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
