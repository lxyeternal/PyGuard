{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of commented-out test functions for plotting utilities related to openairbearing components, using mock data for visualization testing.",
  "sources": "No active data sources; mock data generation is commented out; no external input or data handling.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; all data used internally within the test functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows to external systems; mock data is generated locally and used for plotting.",
  "anomalies": "All code is commented out; no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of inactive, commented-out test functions that generate mock data for plotting. There are no active data flows, external communications, or suspicious structures. The code is benign, static, and intended for visualization testing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and purely for testing purposes. It poses no supply chain security risk or malicious threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
