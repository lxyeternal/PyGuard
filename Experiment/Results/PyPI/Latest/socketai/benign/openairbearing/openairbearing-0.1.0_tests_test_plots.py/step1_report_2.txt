{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a test suite for plotting functions related to openairbearing components, intended for validation of visualization functions using mock data.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (pytest, numpy, openairbearing modules, plotly) and commented-out sections that generate mock data.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to files, executes system commands, or transmits data over a network. The only outputs are plotly figures returned by plotting functions.",
  "flows": "Imports provide dependencies; the test functions create mock data for plotting functions; the plotting functions generate figures based on mock data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive commented-out test functions which are benign. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious logic are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward test code that uses mock data to verify visualization functions. It imports necessary libraries, defines test functions (currently commented out), and constructs mock data objects mimicking real data structures. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden code. The code's structure and content are typical for a test suite in a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign test suite for plotting functions with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily creates mock data for visualization validation. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or suspicious activity are evident.",
