  "purpose": "Define a boolean flag to control demo mode behavior within the application.",
  "sources": "None; the code only assigns a static value to a variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; simple variable assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward assignment with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is a simple configuration variable assignment, setting DEMO_MODE to False. It contains no inputs, outputs, data flows, or malicious logic. All reports correctly identify the benign and straightforward nature of this code. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0—are appropriate given the lack of any malicious or security-related issues. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's simplicity. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
