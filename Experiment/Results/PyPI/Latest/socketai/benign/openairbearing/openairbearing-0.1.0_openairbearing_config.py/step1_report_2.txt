{
  "purpose": "Defines a demo mode flag to control solution point limits in a larger application.",
  "sources": "None, as the code only assigns a boolean constant.",
  "sinks": "None, no data processing or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None, no data flow or source-to-sink pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; simple variable assignment with a comment.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a variable 'DEMO_MODE' and sets it to False. The comment indicates it limits solution points in demo mode, suggesting it's a control flag for application behavior. No input, data reading, or security-sensitive operations are present. No malicious or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward configuration flag with no malicious intent or security risks. The code is benign and simple.",
