  "purpose": "Define a configuration variable to control demo mode limitations",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading present",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only sets a constant",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward variable assignment",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a boolean variable 'DEMO_MODE' and assigns it the value False. There are no data inputs, no processing, no external calls, and no sensitive operations. The variable likely controls some feature limit in a larger application, but by itself, it does not perform any malicious activity or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be a simple configuration setting without any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
