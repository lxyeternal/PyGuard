  "purpose": "The code sets a demo mode flag that likely controls restrictions on solution points in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads a configuration variable DEMO_MODE.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "DEM_MODE variable is set to False; no data flow or input/output flows are demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior; minimal code with a simple boolean assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a boolean variable DEMO_MODE with a value of False. It appears to be a flag controlling demo mode features. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic. No hardcoded credentials, data leakage, or malicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and does not include any suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setting with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
