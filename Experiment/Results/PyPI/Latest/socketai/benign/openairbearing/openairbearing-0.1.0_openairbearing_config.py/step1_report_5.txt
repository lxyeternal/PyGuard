  "purpose": "Set a flag to indicate whether the demo mode is active, limiting solution points.",
  "sources": "Assignment of DEMO_MODE variable; no input reading involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; variable assignment is straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single boolean variable DEMO_MODE set to False. It appears to serve as a flag for limiting functionalities in demo mode. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external interactions, or security-sensitive operations. The code is simple and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration flag with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
