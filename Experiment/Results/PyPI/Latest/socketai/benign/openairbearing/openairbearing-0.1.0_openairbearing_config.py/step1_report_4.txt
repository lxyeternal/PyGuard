  "purpose": "The code defines a single boolean variable to control demo mode limitations.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the DEMO_MODE variable.",
  "sinks": "The variable assignment itself; no data flow to other parts of code is shown.",
  "flows": "None apparent; only a static variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the variable name and value appear straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a flag 'DEMO_MODE' to False, indicating that demo mode is disabled. This is a common configuration setting. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors in this snippet. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident based on this limited context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration setting without any malicious intent or security risks. It merely controls a demo mode limit and does not perform any unsafe or suspicious actions.",
