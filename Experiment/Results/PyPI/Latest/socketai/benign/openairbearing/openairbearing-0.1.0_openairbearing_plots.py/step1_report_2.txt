{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate various plots for bearing analysis and visualization, including pressure distribution, shape profiles, stiffness, and flow rates.",
  "sources": "Input data from function arguments (bearing objects, results objects), and numpy/scipy computations; no external or untrusted sources are directly read within the code.",
  "sinks": "The code generates plot objects and visualizations; it does not write to files, send data over networks, or execute external commands. No sinks indicate malicious data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects (bearing, results) through calculations, then into plotting functions which produce visualization figures. No untrusted data flows to external systems or network sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard plotting libraries and scientific computations without obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The commented-out function does not contain malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code uses established plotting libraries (plotly, numpy, scipy) to visualize bearing analysis results. No external data inputs are processed that could be malicious. The functions process provided data and produce figures; there are no network operations, file I/O, or command executions. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be a typical visualization module for engineering analysis, with straightforward logic and safe library usage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard visualization module for bearing analysis with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It safely processes input data to produce plots without external communication or harmful operations.",
