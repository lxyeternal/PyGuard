{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate various plots for analyzing and visualizing bearing geometries and results, likely for a mechanical or engineering application involving pressure, stiffness, flow rates, and shape profiles.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from parameters of 'bearing' objects and 'results' objects, which contain arrays and attributes such as 'ha', 'p', 'k', 'w', 'qs', 'qc', 'qa', and geometrical parameters. These are used to generate plots and interpolations.",
  "sinks": "The code generates visualizations using Plotly, with no evident data sinks or network communications. No external data is sent over the network, stored, or otherwise leaked.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'bearing' and 'results' objects into plotting functions, where arrays are accessed and transformed for visualization. There are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data manipulation beyond data visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hard-coded credentials, or backdoors are observed. The code relies on standard libraries and practices. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious injections. Print statements are present but are harmless debug logs related to geometry calculations. No functions perform external system modifications or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports libraries for numerical computation and plotting, defines style and layout constants, and implements several plotting functions. These functions handle input data from 'bearing' and 'results' objects, creating visualizations for mechanical properties. The code uses standard patterns for plotting with Plotly, including line plots, contour plots, and shape profiles. The only noteworthy side effect is a debug print statement within 'plot_xz_shape', which outputs array shapes during processing. There are no indications of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, system access, or network communication. No dynamically executed code or obfuscated sections are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization module for bearing analysis. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of a debug print statement is harmless. Overall, the code appears safe with no signs of supply chain or malicious activity.",
