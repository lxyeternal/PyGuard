  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, and overall security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a visualization module for bearing analysis, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The only noted anomaly is a print statement used for debugging.\n- **Assessment:** The functions operate solely on provided data, generating Plotly figures. No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's nature. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a standard visualization tool with no external data leaks or malicious intent. The print statement is benign.\n- **Assessment:** No external data handling or network activity. The code uses standard libraries without obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (slightly above zero, possibly due to debugging print statements, but not malicious).\n- **Conclusion:** The risk score is reasonable; the code remains benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a visualization module with no signs of malicious behavior. The print statement in `plot_xz_shape` is noted but not harmful.\n- **Assessment:** No external data flow or malicious code. The code is safe and straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The security risk is minimal.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent; no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar findings; the code is a visualization suite with benign debug print statements.\n- **Assessment:** No external or untrusted data flows, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (due to debug print).\n- **Conclusion:** The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a visualization tool, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors. The print statement is benign.\n- **Assessment:** Straightforward data visualization with no external data leaks or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely for visualization, with no network, file, or system modification operations.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports due to debugging print statements, but these are benign and common during development.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The print statements are for debugging and do not pose security risks.\n- The data flow is contained within the application, with no external or untrusted data sources involved.\n- The code uses standard libraries and practices.\n\n### My Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, well-structured code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** (minimal, mainly due to debug print statements, which are benign)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, standard visualization module with no security concerns.",
