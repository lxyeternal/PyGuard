  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code provides multiple visualization functions for bearing analysis.\n- It uses standard scientific libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Plotly).\n- No external data sources or network communications are present.\n- Debugging print statements exist (notably in `plot_xz_shape`), but these are benign.\n- No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- Data flows are straightforward, from input objects to visual outputs.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Describes visualization functions based on 'bearing' and 'results' objects.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior; debug print statements are noted but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The print statements are typical debugging artifacts, not malicious. The high risk score (0.9) seems to overstate the potential security concern, given the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Similar, no external or untrusted sources.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; debug print statement in `plot_xz_shape` is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe low risk score aligns with the analysis. The reasoning is consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Same pattern; no external data leaks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious code; print statement is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe assessment is appropriate. The code is a visualization tool with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Similar, with no external data or network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; print statement is harmless.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is consistent and reasonable. The minimal risk score reflects the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Same, no external or malicious data handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; print statement is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the absence of security risks.\n\n**Note on the high risk scores (e.g., 0.9 in Report 1):**  \nGiven the analysis, these are overestimations. The code is a straightforward visualization module with no malicious intent. The presence of print statements is typical debugging and does not indicate security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Should be very low, around 0.0–0.1, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a standard, safe visualization utility for bearing analysis with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores should be adjusted downward to reflect this, especially the overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0–0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the absence of any malicious indicators.",
