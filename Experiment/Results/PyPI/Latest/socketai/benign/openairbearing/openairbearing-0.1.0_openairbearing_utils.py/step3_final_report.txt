{
  "purpose": "The code performs physics-based calculations related to bearing geometry, permeability, flow, load capacity, and stiffness, relying on input attributes of a bearing object.",
  "sources": "Input attributes of the bearing object such as 'case', 'nx', 'ny', 'x', 'y', 'xa', 'ya', 'xv', 'yv', 'error_type', 'kappa', 'Qsc', 'mu', 'pa', 'psc', 'blocked', 'block_A', 'A', 'rho', 'theta', 'dx', 'dy', 'clearance', 'geom', 'ha', 'e', 'h', 'h1', 'h2', 'x', 'y', 'nx', 'ny', 'xc', 'yc', 'case', 'csys', 'error', 'error_type', 'block', 'blocked', 'Qsc', 'mu', 'pa', 'psc', 'A', 'kappa', 'Qsc', 'rho', 'theta', 'dx', 'dy', 'clearance', 'geom', 'ha', 'e', 'h', 'x', 'y', 'nx', 'ny', 'xc', 'yc'.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or external communication; calculations are internal and self-contained.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input attributes of the bearing object through mathematical functions to output results such as area, geometry, permeability, flow rates, load capacity, and stiffness.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or hidden behaviors detected. The commented-out 'get_y' function is harmless and incomplete but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard scientific calculations with clear, straightforward numpy operations. It relies on object attributes, which could be manipulated if untrusted, but this is typical in engineering models. No external communication, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The functions are well-structured, and the purpose is transparent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate engineering computation module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as zero. Overall, the supply chain security risk for this code is minimal.",
