{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform calculations related to bearing geometry, permeability, flow, and load capacity, likely for engineering or simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data for bearings such as attributes of bearing geometry, properties, and external parameters (e.g., bearing dimensions, error types, pressure distributions).",
  "sinks": "Mathematical calculations and functions that process the bearing data; no apparent data leaks or external data handling beyond internal calculations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from bearing attribute inputs through various calculations (e.g., get_area, get_geom, get_kappa, get_load_capacity, get_volumetric_flow) to produce output values like flow rates, stiffness, and load capacity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data handling are observed. The code contains detailed physical calculations without external system interaction or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code provides mathematical functions for physical modeling of bearings, including geometry, permeability, flow, and load calculations. The code uses standard numpy operations and pattern matching for control flow, with clear separation of concerns. No obfuscated code, no external system calls, no data exfiltration mechanisms, and no suspicious data handling are present. The code appears to be a typical engineering calculation module, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard computational module for bearing physics calculations, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs mathematical modeling with well-structured functions and no external data leaks or backdoors.",
