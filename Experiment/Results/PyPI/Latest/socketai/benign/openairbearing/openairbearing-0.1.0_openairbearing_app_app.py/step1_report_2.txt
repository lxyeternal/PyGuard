{
  "purpose": "To create and run a web application for open-air bearing analysis using Dash framework.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules for app layout, callbacks, bearing calculations, and solver functions; it also reads environment variables indirectly via Dash configuration.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak data or harm the system.",
  "flows": "The application flow involves initializing objects and layout, registering callbacks, and running a server, with no external input data processing or network interactions in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. The email contact and GitHub link are benign and intended for user information.",
  "analysis": "The code imports essential modules for web app creation and physics calculations, sets default parameters, initializes the app with metadata and layout, registers callbacks, and defines a main function to run the server with debugging enabled. No external data sources, untrusted input handling, or malicious code patterns are present. The inline HTML template is standard for Dash apps. The code appears to be a straightforward setup for a web-based engineering tool with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Dash application setup for a physics/engineering tool, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply initializes and runs a web app with provided modules and layout. No security concerns are identified.",
