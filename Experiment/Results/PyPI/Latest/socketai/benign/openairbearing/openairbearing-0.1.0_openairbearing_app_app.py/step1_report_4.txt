{
  "purpose": "To create and run a web application for analyzing and visualizing air bearing performance using Dash.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Dash and internal modules; default_bearing instantiation; solve_bearing function call; environment variables and app configuration.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flow through app layout creation and callback registration; no direct data sinks or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from imported modules and default_bearing to layout and callback functions; no evidence of untrusted data flowing to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; app configuration and HTML template are standard; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and internal application components for setting up a Dash app, including layout creation and callback registration. It initializes a bearing object with default parameters, then computes a result with solve_bearing. The app configuration appears typical for a Dash application, with a custom index string for HTML structure. No external data is fetched or sent, and there are no embedded malicious behaviors or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and aligns with common web app practices, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Dash application setup for air bearing analysis without any suspicious or malicious elements. It appears safe and free from malware or security risks.",
