  "purpose": "Set up a Dash web application for open-air bearing analysis, including layout, callbacks, and server execution.",
  "sources": "Imports modules for layout, callbacks, bearings, solvers; initializes bearing object; performs initial calculation; sets app layout; registers callbacks; runs server.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network communication, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of bearing object -> layout creation -> callback registration -> server run.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup for a Dash app, importing internal modules, creating a default bearing, performing a calculation, and configuring the server. It runs with debug=True, which is typical for development but insecure for production. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. External modules are not shown; their trustworthiness depends on their source, but the main script appears benign. No external data handling or network activity is present. The code is clear and well-structured, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Dash application setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The primary concern is the use of debug=True in server execution, which should be disabled in production. External dependencies' security depends on their trustworthiness, but based on this snippet, no malicious activity is detected.",
