  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, following the outlined steps:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Describes a dashboard for bearing analysis; sources are user inputs, sinks are figures and input updates. No suspicious activity noted.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no malicious code, standard patterns. Uses imported modules for calculations and plotting, which are assumed safe.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, no malware, low security risk (0.2). Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code in the report matches the original code provided; no signs of malicious activity.  \n- The malware score of 0 is justified.  \n- Obfuscated score of 0 is correct.  \n- Risk score of 0.2 is reasonable given the context; the code handles user inputs and calculations without external threats.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to Report 1, managing user interactions and visualizations. No external data leaks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external system modifications. Functions are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, no malware, security risk 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is consistent with the original; no malicious behavior detected.  \n- Malware score remains at 0.  \n- Obfuscated score is 0.  \n- Security risk score is 0, justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Web interface for bearing models, standard data flow. No suspicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity. Uses external modules for calculations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, no malware, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code matches the original, with no signs of malicious payloads.  \n- Malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, risk is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Manages user interactions, updates figures, resets values. No external threats.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, no malware, risk 0.1, confidence 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Consistent with the original code; no malicious indicators.  \n- Malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, risk low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to others, handling user input and visualization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no external network calls.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, no malware, risk 0, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Fully aligned with the original code; no malicious signs.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are justified given the code's nature—handling user inputs, calculations, and visualizations—without external or malicious operations.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no signs of malware)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** (minimal, primarily due to user input handling and calculation complexity, but no security issues)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports accurately reflect the code's behavior. The code is a standard, transparent implementation of a Dash web app for bearing analysis, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
