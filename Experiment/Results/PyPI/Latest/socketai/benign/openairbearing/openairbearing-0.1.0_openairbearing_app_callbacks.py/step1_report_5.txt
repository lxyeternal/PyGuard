{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Dash web application for configuring, visualizing, and solving bearing models in engineering simulations, with callback functions managing user interactions and data flow.",
  "sources": "Input data from user interface elements such as dropdowns, sliders, and buttons (e.g., 'case-select', 'solver-select', parameter input fields, reset buttons).",
  "sinks": "Calls to solve_bearing (which performs calculations), plotting functions (plot_bearing_shape, plot_key_results), and updating figure components; also updates input field values and container styles.",
  "flows": "User inputs trigger callbacks that read data (sources), instantiate bearing objects, modify parameters, perform calculations (via solve_bearing), and update figures and inputs (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity observed. The code involves straightforward data flow for a scientific UI; no obfuscated code patterns or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages user interface interactions and data processing for a bearing simulation tool. It safely creates bearing instances, updates parameters, and visualizes results. No network communications, system modifications, or malicious behaviors are present. Exception handling logs errors but does not include harmful actions. No hidden code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious imports are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and well-structured application for engineering computations with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It only performs data input, processing, and visualization tasks, consistent with an open-source engineering tool.",
