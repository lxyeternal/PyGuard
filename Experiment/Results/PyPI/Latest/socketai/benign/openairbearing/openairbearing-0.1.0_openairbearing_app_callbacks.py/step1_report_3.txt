{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Dash-based web interface for configuring and solving bearing models with various parameters, including visualizations and callback handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input values from Dash components (e.g., sliders, dropdowns, reset buttons) and callback context for user interactions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs updated figures, parameter values, and UI styles; calls external functions for calculations and plotting.",
  "flows": "User interactions trigger callbacks that read inputs (sources), process parameters, and produce visual and data outputs (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious URL requests or obfuscated code; use of standard libraries; no malicious system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Dash app setup with multiple callbacks managing user inputs, dynamic UI elements, and computational logic. Functions handle parameter updates, reset actions, and interface adjustments based on user selections. The logic for creating bearing objects and updating their properties appears straightforward and adheres to expected patterns. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. External function calls such as solve_bearing, plot_bearing_shape, get_kappa, get_Qsc, and get_beta are assumed to be safe and relevant to the domain, with no indication of malicious intent. The code focuses solely on computational and UI management, with no evidence of harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Dash app for bearing simulation with no detected malicious or sabotage behavior. It handles user inputs, updates, and visualization in a conventional manner. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
