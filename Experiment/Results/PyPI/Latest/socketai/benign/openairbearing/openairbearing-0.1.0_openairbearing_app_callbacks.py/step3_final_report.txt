{
  "purpose": "The code implements a web dashboard for bearing analysis, managing user inputs, visualizations, and calculations related to bearing parameters.",
  "sources": "User input fields (e.g., case selection, parameters, reset buttons), callback context for detecting changes.",
  "sinks": "Figures and plots displaying bearing shapes and key results, input value updates.",
  "flows": "User inputs trigger callbacks that create or update bearing instances, perform calculations via solve_bearing, and update figures and input values accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The code uses standard libraries and functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Dash application with well-structured callback functions for handling user interactions, parameter updates, and visualization. It creates bearing objects based on user input, updates parameters like kappa and Qsc, and calls solver functions to generate results. Error handling is present, and input resets are managed logically. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the code's transparent and domain-specific nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured engineering dashboard with no malicious or suspicious elements. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the low risk scores are justified. Overall, the code poses no security threat and is safe for use.",
