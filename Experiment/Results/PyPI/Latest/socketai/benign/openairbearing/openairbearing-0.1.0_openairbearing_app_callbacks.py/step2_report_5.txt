  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Describes standard UI interactions, no external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Straightforward Dash app for bearing analysis, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.2) aligns with the benign nature. The malware score is zero, and no obfuscation is present. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to Report 1, user input-driven visualization.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no external network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate application components, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. Zero malware and obfuscation, minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Manages user inputs, calls external calculation and plotting functions.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, uses standard libraries.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical Dash app for engineering simulations, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score is appropriate; no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to previous reports, handles user interactions, updates figures.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, straightforward code for visualization and parameter management.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with a benign application.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Manages user input, calls computational functions, updates visualization.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious network activity, no obfuscation, straightforward data flow.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid engineering application, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent with a safe, open-source tool.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports describe code that manages user inputs, performs calculations via imported functions, and updates visualizations. No evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious commands.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's functions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports report 0, and the code appears clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly varying but low (0.1 to 0.2), justified by the absence of malicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, and standard library usage.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** The code does not contain any malicious payloads, system commands, or network activity. The functions are domain-specific and standard for such applications.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation techniques are present; the code is transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** The low scores are justified; the code is a typical engineering dashboard with no evident security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, justified by the nature of the app, primarily UI and calculations, no external threats.\n\n**Final Note:** The reports are consistent and justified. The code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, transparent implementation of a web-based engineering tool with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.",
