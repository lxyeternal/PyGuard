{
  "purpose": "The code defines callback functions for a Dash web application to update and reset bearing simulation parameters and visualize results based on user input.",
  "sources": "User interactions via input fields, dropdowns, buttons, and case selections; external functions for plotting, solving, and parameter calculations.",
  "sinks": "Update of figures and input field values; internal function calls for calculations; no direct data leaks or external network connections present.",
  "flows": "User inputs trigger update or reset callbacks that process parameters, instantiate bearing objects, and generate visualizations or reset values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. No unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or misleading variables present.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically handles user inputs for various bearing configurations and parameters, updating visualizations accordingly. It uses standard Python and Dash features, with well-structured functions for updating figures and input values. All calculations rely on imported modules, with no direct network or system command execution. Exception handling is present but limited to printing errors and returning empty figures. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage in the code. The code follows standard practices for a web-based dashboard without evident security issues or hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of a web application for bearing analysis, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It primarily manages user interactions and visualizations without performing any harmful operations or data exfiltration.",
