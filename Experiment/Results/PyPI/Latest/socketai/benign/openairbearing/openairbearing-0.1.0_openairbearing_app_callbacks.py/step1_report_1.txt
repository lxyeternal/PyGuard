{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to create and manage a web-based dashboard application for analyzing bearings using Dash, including updating plots, managing input parameters, and resetting values.",
  "sources": "Input data from user interactions such as dropdowns, text inputs, button clicks, and callback context within Dash.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily updates visual figures, input values, and style properties. No direct data leaks, file operations, or network activities are evident.",
  "flows": "User interactions trigger callbacks that read input values, instantiate bearing objects, perform calculations via solve_bearing, and update figures and inputs accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. The code uses standard library functions and follows typical Dash callback patterns. No obfuscated or misleading code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Dash web app with callbacks to update visualizations and parameters based on user input. It creates bearing objects based on selected cases and parameters, recalculates results using solver functions, and updates the plots. Reset functions restore default values based on the current case. All operations are within expected patterns for such a dashboard, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of a web dashboard for bearing analysis. No malicious or suspicious activities are detected. The logic is consistent, and no signals of malware or security risks are evident.",
