  "purpose": "This package provides tools for analyzing and visualizing air bearing performance, including classes, utilities, solvers, plotting functions, and app integration.",
  "sources": "Import statements for constants, classes, functions, and modules from within the package, including config, bearings, utils, solvers, plots, and app.",
  "sinks": "Exports defined in __all__, including app, bearing classes, utility functions, solver functions, visualization functions, and configuration variables.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports and exports are static. The code does not handle user input or external data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code structures, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code appears to be standard package setup and module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, variable definitions, and export declarations. It imports modules and functions from within the package, defines version info, and specifies what symbols are publicly available. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or external data handling is present. The structure aligns with a typical Python package's __init__.py file or main module.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The code functions as a standard package initializer with no evident security risks or suspicious activity.",
