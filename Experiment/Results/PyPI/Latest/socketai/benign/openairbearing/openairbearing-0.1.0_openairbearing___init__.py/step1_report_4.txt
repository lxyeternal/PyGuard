{
  "purpose": "This package provides tools for analyzing and visualizing air bearing performance, including classes, utilities, solvers, plots, and an app component.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and functions from local package files (.config, .bearings, .utils, .solvers, .plots, .app.app). No external or untrusted input sources are explicitly referenced.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily imports and exposes functions and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The import statements are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines metadata, imports modules and functions from local package files, and specifies the __all__ list for export. It appears to be a standard package __init__.py setup for organizing and exposing package components. No suspicious code, hidden behaviors, or malicious logic is present. The structure and content are typical for a Python package meant for computational and visualization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization file with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It only imports and re-exports modules and functions relevant to the package's purpose.",
