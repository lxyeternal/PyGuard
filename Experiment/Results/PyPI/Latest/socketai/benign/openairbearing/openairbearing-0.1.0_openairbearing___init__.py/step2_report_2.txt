  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is a standard package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n   - The code consists solely of import statements, variable definitions (__version__), and an __all__ list for exports.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, file operations, or data handling from untrusted sources are present.\n   - The code structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or main module.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The import statements are straightforward, importing from internal modules.\n   - The __all__ list correctly exposes the intended symbols.\n   - No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns, are observed.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** Also 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 across all reports, justified because there's no evidence of security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code does not handle user input, external data, or perform any network operations.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based solely on static code review.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content.\n   - The conclusions are justified and aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Additional Notes:\nGiven the nature of this code (a package's core module or __init__.py), it is purely organizational, importing and exposing components. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security flaws.\n\n**In conclusion, I agree with the existing scores and assessments.**",
