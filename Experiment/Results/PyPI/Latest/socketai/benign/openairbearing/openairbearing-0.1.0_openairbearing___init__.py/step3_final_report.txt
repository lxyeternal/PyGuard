{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the main module or __init__.py file for the openairbearing package, organizing imports and defining the public API.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules and a version variable",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, user input, or network operations",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ declaration, with no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export structure, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initialization script, importing various classes, functions, and variables, then exposing them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving organizational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It functions solely as a package setup script, and the scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
