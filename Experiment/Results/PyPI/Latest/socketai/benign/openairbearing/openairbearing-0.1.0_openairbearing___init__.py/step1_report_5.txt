{
  "purpose": "This package provides tools for analyzing and visualizing air bearing performance, including classes, utilities, solvers, and visualization functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.config, .bearings, .utils, .solvers, .plots, .app.app). No external data input sources are explicitly shown in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data sinks or network communications are visible in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks are apparent; the code mainly defines imports and the __all__ interface for exposing components.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated segments. The code consists of straightforward imports and variable definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports various modules and functions related to bearing analysis, visualization, configuration, and application setup. It defines the __all__ list for namespace control. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic. The structure appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py or main module file, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard package initialization script with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It imports and exposes components in a typical manner. There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activities detected.",
