  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a standard package initialization or __init__.py file.\n- They confirm that the code only performs static imports, variable definitions, and export declarations.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, no file writes, no dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are observed.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, with high confidence (1), and security risk scores of 0.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code provided is purely organizational, importing modules, functions, and classes, and exposing them via `__all__`.\n- The purpose is to serve as a package initializer or main module, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis.\n- They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The absence of dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns supports this conclusion.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, there is no need to adjust scores.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The risk scores are also appropriate given the lack of any suspicious activity.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a typical package __init__.py file, organizing imports and exports.\n- No malicious or security-risk behaviors are present.\n- The reports' conclusions are justified and consistent with the code.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0.\n- The security risk score remains at 0.\n- The confidence remains high (1).\n\n**Additional Note:**\n- While the current code appears safe, always consider future updates or dependencies that might introduce risks. Regular security reviews of dependencies are recommended.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
