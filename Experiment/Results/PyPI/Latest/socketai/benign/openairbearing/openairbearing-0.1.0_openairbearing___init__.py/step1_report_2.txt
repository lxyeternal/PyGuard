{
  "purpose": "This package provides tools for analyzing and visualizing air bearing performance.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.config, .bearings, .utils, .solvers, .plots, .app.app), and the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; no data is being sent over the network, stored insecurely, or manipulated in an unsafe manner.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code primarily imports modules and defines __all__ for exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward import statements and an __all__ definition for public API exposure. It imports constants, classes, functions, visualization routines, and the app instance from local modules. No data is processed, manipulated, or transmitted. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are observed. The structure aligns with a typical Python package setup intended for providing computational and visualization tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured Python package core file with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly manages imports and exposes an API, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
