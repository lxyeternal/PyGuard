{
  "purpose": "This package provides tools for analyzing and visualizing air bearing performance, including classes, utility functions, solvers, and plotting tools.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.config, .bearings, .utils, .solvers, .plots, .app.app). No external data input or network operations present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The code mainly performs module imports and exports, with clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python package __init__ file that imports various modules, functions, and classes for an air bearing analysis tool. It defines the __version__, imports constants, classes, functions, and visualization tools, and specifies the public API via __all__. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious network activity, or security risks. The code's purpose is purely organizational and API setup, with no data processing or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization script with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply organizes and exposes modules for an air bearing analysis library.",
