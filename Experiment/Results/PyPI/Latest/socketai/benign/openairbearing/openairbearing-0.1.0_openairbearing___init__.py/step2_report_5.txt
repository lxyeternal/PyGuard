  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a straightforward package initialization or __init__.py-like module.\n- They note that the code only performs static imports, defines __version__, and sets __all__ for public API exposure.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is observed.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The overall conclusion across reports is that the code appears benign, well-structured, and typical for a Python package setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code does **not** contain any dynamic code, user input handling, or external data processing.\n- The import statements are standard, and the __all__ list correctly exposes the intended public API.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The code is purely organizational, serving as a package initializer.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- Since there is no evidence of malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation, scores of 0 are justified.\n- The code's purpose is purely organizational and does not introduce any security risks.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The code does not handle external inputs, user data, or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n- No suspicious patterns or assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard package initialization module with no security concerns.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my reasoning:**\n- The code is purely static, organized, and lacks any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned by the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the current scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk, confirming the benign nature of this package initialization code.",
