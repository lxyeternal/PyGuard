  "purpose": "Unit tests for the command-line interface of the encoderize package, specifically testing output file generation with various options.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (mocked in tests), tempfile.mkdtemp() for output directory, no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "File creation in the specified output directory, checking for existence and size of generated files.",
  "flows": "sys.argv (test args) -> main() -> file creation in output directory",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code observed. Tests only generate files and do not perform network operations or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing modules and uses mock to simulate CLI arguments. It verifies file creation and content size, cleaning up after tests. No code injections, network calls, or malicious behavior are detected. The tests are standard for verifying CLI functionality, and all operations are confined to the filesystem. There are no obfuscated code segments or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for CLI functionality, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply verifies that expected files are generated with given arguments. No vulnerabilities or malicious actions are present.",
