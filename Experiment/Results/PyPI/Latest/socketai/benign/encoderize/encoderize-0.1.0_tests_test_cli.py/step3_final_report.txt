{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the encoderize CLI, verifying that it generates expected SVG output files based on input text and display modes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from mocked sys.argv parameters, specifically the CLI arguments for text input, output directory, and display mode flags.",
  "sinks": "The code writes SVG files to a temporary directory, verifying their existence and size; no untrusted data is used in a way that leads to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Test setup mocks sys.argv -> main() executes with provided arguments -> SVG files are generated in the output directory -> test verifies file existence and size -> cleanup removes files.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard libraries and testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured test suite that mocks CLI inputs, runs the main function, and verifies file creation. It performs no network activity, no external data handling, and no malicious operations. The file creation is confined to a temporary directory, and cleanup is performed after tests. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are detected. The logic is consistent with typical testing practices, and the code's behavior is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign test suite for verifying CLI output files. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's functionality.",
