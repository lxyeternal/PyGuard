  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a standard, benign test suite for the encoderize CLI.\n- They emphasize that the tests involve mocking sys.argv, creating temporary directories, invoking main(), and verifying file creation.\n- No suspicious code, external network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are observed.\n- The reports assign very high confidence (mostly 1.0) that there are no security issues or malware.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, and the obfuscated scores are 0 as well.\n- The overall security risk is rated as 0 in all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's content:\n\n- The code is a typical unittest-based test suite.\n- It uses `patch('sys.argv', ...)` to simulate CLI inputs.\n- It calls `main()` from `encoderize.cli`.\n- It checks for expected SVG files, their existence, and size.\n- It cleans up files afterward.\n- No network calls, no external data, no code injection, no credential handling, no obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, standard testing code, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and scoring review:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malware present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is just a test suite with no malicious intent, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Confidence levels:** High, given the clear analysis.\n\n### Any discrepancies or concerns?\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No assumptions are made beyond what the code shows.\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.0 (no vulnerabilities or malicious actions)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The code is purely for testing file outputs; it does not perform any dangerous operations.\n- The tests are well-structured and confined to temporary directories.\n- No external dependencies or data are involved that could introduce security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Value | Justification                                                                                     |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0.0          | No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior observed.                         |\n| Obfuscated       | 0.0          | Code is clear, uses standard libraries, no obfuscation techniques detected.                   |\n| Security Risk    | 0.0          | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious actions present.                                |\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard test suite with no security concerns.**",
