{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the command-line interface of the encoderize project, specifically testing output file creation with different modes.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (mocked for command-line arguments), tempfile.mkdtemp() (creates temporary directory), os.listdir() and os.path functions (inspect directory contents), and main() from encoderize.cli.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks, external network access, or system modifications. File creation is confined within a temporary directory; no untrusted input used in dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments (source) influence main() execution, which generates SVG files in a temporary directory. No data flow outside the process or to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard testing patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic code execution or malicious commands detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing of CLI functionality, mocking sys.argv to simulate user input, and verifying file creation in a temporary directory. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It is strictly a testing script that creates and cleans up files within a controlled environment. All operations are safe, and the code follows typical testing conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign test suite verifying that the CLI generates the expected SVG output files in various modes. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code is standard testing code with no malicious intent.",
