{
  "purpose": "Defines a module that imports and exposes various visualizer functions for text-to-SVG visualizations.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from a local module '.visualizers'. No external data sources or input reading is evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident within this code snippet; it mainly imports and exposes functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets module metadata, imports specific visualization functions from a local package, and defines __all__ for export. There are no indications of code execution, external data processing, or suspicious activities. The functions are presumably safe as they are imported from another local module, and this file itself contains only standard import and export statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a visualization package, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and straightforward.",
