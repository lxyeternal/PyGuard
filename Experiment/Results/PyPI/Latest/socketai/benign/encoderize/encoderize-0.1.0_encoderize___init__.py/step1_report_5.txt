{
  "purpose": "This module acts as an interface for various text visualization functions that generate SVG images.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from the .visualizers module, which may include user input handling or external data processing within those functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the SVG file generation functions that could write data to files or output streams, but no direct network or data exfiltration code is present here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input text to visualization functions, which generate SVG files. No external data flows or untrusted data handling are explicitly shown.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python module interface.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module for visualizing text in various SVG formats, importing functions from a relative visualizers module. It only includes function imports and a list of exported symbols. No input handling, data processing, or network operations are visible. Since the actual implementation resides in imported functions, potential malicious behaviors could exist there, but within this code snippet, no malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module interface with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It simply exposes visualization functions. Given the lack of direct data handling, network, or suspicious patterns, the risk is minimal.",
