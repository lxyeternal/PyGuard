  "purpose": "This module provides functions for generating various visual representations of text/names in SVG format.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from the .visualizers module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable if imported functions execute untrusted code or perform malicious actions when called, but no direct data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Imports from .visualizers → functions available for use; no direct data flow observed within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module with a version string, imports a list of visualization functions from a relative module, and sets __all__ for export. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. It acts as an interface or wrapper to expose visualization functions, with no embedded logic that could be malicious. The code relies on external functions, but their behavior is not specified here; no malicious patterns are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that imports and exposes visualization functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks within this fragment.",
