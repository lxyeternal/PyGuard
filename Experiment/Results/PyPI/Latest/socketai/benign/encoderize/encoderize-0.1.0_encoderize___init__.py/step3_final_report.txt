{
  "purpose": "Module acts as an interface to expose visualization functions for generating SVG representations of text/names.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from the local '.visualizers' module.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication within this code.",
  "flows": "The module imports functions and re-exports them via __all__, with no data processing or flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static import/export pattern, no obfuscation, no embedded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that defines a version string, imports visualization functions from a local module, and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or embedded secrets. The code is static, well-structured, and typical for a package's interface layer. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk near zero) are consistent with this assessment. The only potential concern is the behavior of the imported functions, which cannot be evaluated here, but this does not impact the benign nature of this module itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk scores are appropriate given its static, import/export nature.",
