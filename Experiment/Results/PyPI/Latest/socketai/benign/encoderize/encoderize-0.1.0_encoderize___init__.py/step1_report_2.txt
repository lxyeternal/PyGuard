{
  "purpose": "To provide a collection of functions for generating various text and name visualizations in SVG format.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from the local module '.visualizers' which are used to generate different visualizations based on text input.",
  "sinks": "Potential SVG file outputs generated by the imported functions; no explicit data sinks in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Text input -> visualization functions -> SVG file outputs; the code itself mainly imports and re-exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected; the code is straightforward module initialization and import/export.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module with a version, imports multiple visualization functions from a local module, and sets an __all__ list for exports. There is no evidence of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or external data transmission. The structure appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving as an entry point for the visualizer functions. The lack of any network operations, dynamic code execution, or embedded secrets indicates low risk. All imported functions are assumed to be legitimate visualizer generators based on their names.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a module initializer, re-exporting visualization functions. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this code segment. It appears to be a standard, benign Python module setup.",
