  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward module that imports visualization functions from a local module and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- They note no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no network or data exfiltration activities.\n- The primary concern raised is the potential for the imported functions to perform malicious actions, but within this snippet, no such activity is evident.\n- Confidence levels are very high (mostly 1), and the malware and security risk scores are all zero or near-zero, indicating low risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code snippet itself.\n- **Malicious code or anomalies:** None detected; code is static, well-structured, and typical for a module initializer.\n- **Data flows and sinks:** No data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution observed here.\n- **Potential risks:** The only possible concern is the behavior of the imported functions, but this cannot be assessed from this code alone.\n\n### Evaluation of Scores:\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- The high confidence levels are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- The minimal risk scores reflect the lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since the code is purely an interface layer with no embedded logic, higher malware or risk scores are unwarranted.\n- The malware score remains at 0 because there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk is minimal, given the lack of external data handling or network activity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Overall malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code appears to be a benign, standard module initializer exposing visualization functions, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
