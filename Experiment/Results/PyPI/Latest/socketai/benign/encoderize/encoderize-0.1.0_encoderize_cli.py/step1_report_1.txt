  "purpose": "Command-line interface for generating visual SVG representations of text using various encoding functions.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments ('--text', '--output-dir', '--dark', '--light') and function parameters within visualization functions.",
  "sinks": "File system operations such as os.makedirs() and the invocation of visualization functions that generate SVG files in the specified output directory.",
  "flows": "User provides text and options -> script processes arguments -> creates output directory -> calls visualization functions with text and filenames -> functions generate SVGs saved to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles argument parsing, directory creation, and calling predefined visualization functions. These functions are imported from the same package but are not detailed here; assuming they are safe. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or sensitive data handling. The only potential concern could be if the visualization functions have hidden malicious behavior, but based on the visible code, there's no evidence of such activity. The script's structure appears standard for a command-line tool, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI wrapper for visualization functions, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet. It safely generates SVG files from user input without engaging in unsafe operations.",
