  "purpose": "Command-line interface for generating various SVG visualizations of text in different modes.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (--text, --output-dir, --dark, --light), environment variables (not used), imported functions from local module.",
  "sinks": "File system writes for SVG files in the specified output directory.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> function calls with text and filename -> SVG file creation in output directory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward CLI logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports visualization functions, parses command-line arguments, creates an output directory, and calls visualization functions to generate SVG files in specified modes. It includes standard practices such as argument defaults and directory creation. The functions invoked are assumed to generate SVGs based on the text input. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or unsafe operations. File output is limited to SVG files in a user-specified directory, with no network activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a CLI tool for generating SVG visualizations. It appears legitimate with no malicious intent or security risks detected based on the provided code. It safely handles input and file output with standard operations.",
