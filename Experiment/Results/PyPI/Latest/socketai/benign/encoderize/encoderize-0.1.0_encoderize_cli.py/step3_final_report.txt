  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for generating SVG visualizations from text input.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, reading 'text' parameter, and output directory creation.",
  "sinks": "File system writes for SVG files; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input text -> visualization functions -> SVG files written to output directory.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard argument parsing and file operations; no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface that invokes imported visualization functions to generate SVG images based on user-specified text. It handles argument parsing, mode selection (light/dark), directory creation, and calls functions with optional color parameters. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. The imported functions' internal safety cannot be assessed here, but the script itself is benign. Use of 'co_varnames' to check for 'color' parameter is standard. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured CLI tool for visualizing text. No malicious or security-risk behavior is evident in this code snippet. The overall security posture is very low risk, contingent on the safety of the imported functions. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal concern due to external dependencies.",
