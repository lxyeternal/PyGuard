  "purpose": "Command-line interface for generating various visual SVG representations of input text using different encoding functions.",
  "sources": "User input from command-line arguments (--text, --output-dir, --dark, --light).",
  "sinks": "File system writes to generate SVG files in specified output directory.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments flows through the script, invoking visualization functions that write SVG files to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. The code does not perform network operations, code execution, or data exfiltration. The visualization functions are imported but their internal implementations are not shown, so potential malicious behavior within them cannot be ruled out based solely on this code.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments to determine input text, output directory, and modes. It creates the output directory if needed, then iterates through a list of visualization functions to generate corresponding SVG files. It handles mode-specific file naming and attempts to set color parameters for dark mode if supported by the functions. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as network activity, data theft, or backdoors. The script's behavior appears consistent with a benign CLI tool. However, since the visualization functions are imported and their code is not provided, any malicious code within those functions cannot be assessed here. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code acts as a benign CLI wrapper for visualization functions, generating SVG files based on user input. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident from this code alone. The security risk is minimal, assuming the imported functions are safe. Nonetheless, the security assessment of the entire package should include review of the imported visualization functions.",
