  "purpose": "Command-line interface for generating various SVG visualizations from text using multiple encoding functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input text from command-line arguments; reads output directory path from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writes SVG files to specified output directory; calls visualization functions with text and filename arguments.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> Directory creation -> Function list iteration -> SVG file creation in output directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed. The code relies on external functions for SVG generation, which appear benign.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line inputs, ensures output directory exists, and iterates over a list of visualization functions to generate SVG files in both light and dark modes. It handles mode defaults and attempts to set color parameters if supported by functions. No insecure operations, data leakage, or malicious patterns are identified. The code primarily orchestrates external functions for visualization without performing any malicious actions or dangerous data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a safe CLI wrapper for visualization functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply generates SVG files based on user input, without any suspicious activities.",
