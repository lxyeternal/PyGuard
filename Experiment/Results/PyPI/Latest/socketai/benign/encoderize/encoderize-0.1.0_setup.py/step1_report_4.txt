  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'encoderize' Python project, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Data read from the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is processed or output in a vulnerable manner.",
  "flows": "The long description content flows from reading 'README.md' into the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without error handling; no apparent malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions for package setup, specifying dependencies and entry points. No untrusted input is handled during runtime. The only file I/O is reading a local markdown file for description. There are no code injection points, no network connections, and no suspicious operations. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The overall structure appears typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
