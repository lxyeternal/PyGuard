{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'encoderize' Python library",
  "sources": "None; the code is solely for package setup and does not read external input or data at runtime",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous outputs",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script only defines package metadata and dependencies, with no data flow from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed; standard setup script with benign dependencies",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It does not execute any code that processes user input, performs network operations, or handles sensitive data. Dependencies are common for package creation and barcode visualization. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The script appears safe and typical for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points for distribution.",
