  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'encoderize' Python package, defining its metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Constants in setup parameters, reading of 'README.md' for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present; no external data input or output handling detected.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. Reading 'README.md' without sanitization is typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. The only file operation is reading the 'README.md' for the long description, which is typical and not suspicious. No untrusted data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. All dependencies are standard, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions to configure package installation and distribution without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
