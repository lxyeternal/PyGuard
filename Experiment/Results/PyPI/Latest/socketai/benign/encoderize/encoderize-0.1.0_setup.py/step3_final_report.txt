  "purpose": "Define package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point for the 'encoderize' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, package metadata fields, dependencies list, author info, and CLI entry point definition.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Static data from setup configuration to package installation process; no runtime data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward setup script with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. It reads a markdown file for description, specifies dependencies relevant to SVG and barcode generation, and sets package metadata. All provided reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and consistent with the code's static, straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
