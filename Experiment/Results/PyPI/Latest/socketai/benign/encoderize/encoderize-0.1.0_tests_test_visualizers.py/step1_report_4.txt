  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for various SVG visualization functions in the encoderize module.",
  "sources": "Reads input text ('TEST') for generating visualizations; reads and writes SVG files to temporary directory.",
  "sinks": "Writes SVG files to disk, reads generated SVG content for validation.",
  "flows": "Input text 'TEST' flows into visualization functions, which generate SVG files stored in temporary directory; test reads these files to verify content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Usage of svgwrite appears standard for SVG generation. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports visualization functions and runs a series of unit tests generating SVG files with the string 'TEST'. It verifies that files are created and contain content, and in one case, inspects SVG content for expected elements like circles and lines. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, credential access, or system modification. The code performs only file creation, reading, and in-memory content verification within a controlled test environment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for visualization functions, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. It appears safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
