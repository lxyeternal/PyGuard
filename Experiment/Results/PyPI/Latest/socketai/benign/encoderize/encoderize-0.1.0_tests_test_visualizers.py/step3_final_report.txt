  "purpose": "Unit tests for various SVG visualization functions in the encoderize module, verifying SVG file creation and content.",
  "sources": "generate_* functions reading the input string 'TEST' and writing SVG files to disk.",
  "sinks": "File system where SVG files are saved; no untrusted data flows or external network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input string 'TEST' flows into generate_* functions, which produce SVG files; tests read these files to verify content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of pytest.mark decorators within unittest class is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite that generates SVG files using functions from encoderize, then verifies their existence, size, and specific SVG elements. No external network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The tests operate within temporary directories with proper cleanup. The SVG generation functions are assumed safe based on their usage and standard pattern. The only minor stylistic note is the use of pytest.mark decorators within a unittest.TestCase, which does not impact security but is unconventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It operates in a controlled environment, verifying SVG outputs based on static input data.",
