{
  "purpose": "The code defines unit tests for visualization functions in the 'encoderize' module, generating SVG files based on input text to verify their correctness.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text ('TEST') from a class attribute, creates temporary directories and files for output, and reads generated SVG files during tests.",
  "sinks": "The code writes SVG files to the filesystem; no untrusted data is written to external systems, network, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input text flows from class setup into function calls that generate SVGs, which are then read back for verification. No external data flows or untrusted sources beyond local input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward test code without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests for visualization functions, primarily creating and verifying SVG files. It uses standard Python modules like os, tempfile, unittest, and pytest. The test functions generate various SVG graphics based on a fixed input string and check for file existence and size. No network activity, no hardcoded credentials, nor any suspicious code patterns are present. The reading of SVG files and temporary file management follow best practices, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate test code for visualization functions with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on local filesystem and in-memory data, with no external or hidden behaviors. Therefore, it poses no security threat.",
