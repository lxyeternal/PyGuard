  "purpose": "Unit testing visualization functions in the encoderize module by generating SVG files and verifying their existence and content.",
  "sources": "Input text 'TEST' used for generating various visualizations; reading generated SVG files for content verification.",
  "sinks": "Reading SVG files for content; no untrusted data sinks like network or database access are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'TEST' flows into visualization functions, which generate SVG files; the test code reads these files to verify content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code is standard for unit tests with file creation and verification.",
  "analysis": "The code performs structured unit testing using unittest and pytest frameworks. It sets up a temporary directory, generates various SVG visualizations using functions from encoderize, then checks for file existence and content validity. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The SVG content is inspected only for specific tags, and no dangerous operations or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for visualization functions, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities beyond typical file I/O in testing context.",
