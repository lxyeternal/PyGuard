{
  "purpose": "The code provides various functions to generate SVG visualizations for different encoding methods such as binary, Morse, circuit traces, steganography, semaphore flags, A1Z26, barcodes, waveform, chevrons, and Braille, primarily for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken from function parameters like 'name', 'text', 'filename', and character-based mappings; no external input sources are directly read within the code.",
  "sinks": "Generated SVG files are saved to specified filenames; images are embedded into SVG via base64 encoding; no data is transmitted over networks or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through encoding functions, which generate SVG graphics and save them; no untrusted data flows into system commands or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; the functions use standard libraries and straightforward logic without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of functions that generate SVG visualizations based on text input and predefined encoding schemes. It uses standard libraries such as 'math', 'io', 'base64', 'svgwrite', and 'treepoem' to create images and embed data. There are no indications of malicious code such as network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The functions do not perform any unsafe operations, and all external libraries used are legitimate visualization or barcode generation tools. No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of visualization utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It strictly creates visual representations of input text and saves them as SVG files, utilizing standard and trusted libraries. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage within this module.",
