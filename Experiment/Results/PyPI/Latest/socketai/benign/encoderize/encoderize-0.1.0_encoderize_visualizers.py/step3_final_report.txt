{
  "purpose": "The code provides a collection of functions to generate SVG visualizations of text using various encoding schemes, such as binary, Morse, semaphore, Braille, barcode, waveform, chevron, and others.",
  "sources": "Input text strings provided to each visualization function; external libraries svgwrite and treepoem for SVG and barcode generation.",
  "sinks": "Generated SVG or PNG images saved to specified file paths; embedded images within SVG files.",
  "flows": "Input text -> encoding/visualization logic -> SVG or image data -> saved or embedded in SVG files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. Usage of standard libraries for legitimate purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of visualization functions that process input text to produce SVG images using standard libraries. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. External dependencies like 'treepoem' are used appropriately for barcode generation. The code is straightforward, with clear structure and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware or malicious behavior. It serves as a visualization utility with standard library usage. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external dependencies, but these are well-known and legitimate. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is very low (~0.1).",
