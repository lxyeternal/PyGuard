  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware or malicious behavior. It serves as a visualization utility with standard library usage. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external dependencies, but these are well-known and legitimate. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is very low (~0.1)."
