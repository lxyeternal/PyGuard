  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided in the snippet, but it appears to involve some form of data processing or network communication based on the structure.",
  "sources": "Input data is likely read from function arguments, environment variables, or imported modules; specific source points are not clearly indicated in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or environment variable modifications, though no direct evidence of these actions is visible in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow of data from sources to sinks cannot be definitively mapped due to limited code context, but typical flow would involve untrusted input being processed and then transmitted or stored.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are visible in the provided snippet. However, the lack of context prevents full certainty.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward without evident malicious patterns. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated constructs, or unusual logic are detected. The absence of explicit source/sink mapping and detailed behavior limits definitive conclusions. The code's structure does not show signs of malicious intent or sabotage, but incomplete context prevents full assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but limited context means minor uncertainty remains.",
