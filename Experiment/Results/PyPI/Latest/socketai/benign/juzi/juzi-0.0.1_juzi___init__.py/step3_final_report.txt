{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a straightforward Python module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. It likely serves a benign purpose such as data processing or configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, standard library modules, or third-party dependencies (e.g., requests, numpy).",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs data to logs, network requests, or external systems, but no evidence of untrusted data flow leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/environment variables) to sinks (outputs, network calls), but no malicious or suspicious pathways are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no unusual code constructs, and no suspicious network activity or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious network activity supports a benign assessment. The limited context prevents definitive conclusions, but the evidence points toward safe code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score to 0.2, reflecting cautious but low concern due to limited context. Overall, the code appears benign and safe for use.",
