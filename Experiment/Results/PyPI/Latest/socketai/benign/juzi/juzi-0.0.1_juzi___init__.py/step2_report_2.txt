  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the provided scores, and identify any inconsistencies or areas needing adjustment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior or security risks detected; code appears standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report's conclusion aligns with the low malware and obfuscated scores.\n- The securityRisk is set at 0.2, indicating minimal concern, which seems reasonable given the analysis.\n- The confidence is high (0.8), consistent with the thoroughness.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard code with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.7\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The scores are consistent with the report's conclusion.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.7) reflects the limited context, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Minimal, straightforward code with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The securityRisk score is 0, matching the benign assessment.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are 0, consistent.\n- High confidence (0.9) aligns with the straightforward nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious patterns, benign appearance, but limited context.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.6\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The securityRisk is slightly elevated at 0.2, which seems reasonable given the limited context.\n- The confidence is moderate (0.6), appropriate due to incomplete information.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** No evidence of malicious behavior; code appears benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3, confidence=0.7\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The securityRisk score of 0.3 is slightly higher than others, reflecting some uncertainty due to limited details.\n- Confidence at 0.7 seems appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- All reports consistently assign zero malware and obfuscated scores, aligning with their assessments.\n- SecurityRisk scores are low (0 to 0.3), reflecting minimal concern, which is consistent.\n- Confidence levels are appropriate, given the limited code snippets and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\nConsidering all reports and their reasoning, my own assessment would be:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — very low, mainly due to incomplete context; minor uncertainties are possible but unlikely.\n\nThis conservative estimate aligns with the collective evidence indicating benign code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- All report scores are reasonable and consistent with their conclusions.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n- The overall security posture based on these reports is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation concerns.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** Proceed with standard monitoring; no immediate action required.",
