{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script intended for data processing or utility purposes, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "User input via function parameters or command-line arguments; environment variables; file reads if any present.",
  "sinks": "Console output, file writes, network connections, or subprocess calls if present.",
  "flows": "Input sources to processing functions, then to output or network sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious domain connections, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual code patterns or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard function definitions and data processing. No usage of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious network or file activity detected. Third-party libraries, if any, are used normally. Absence of hardcoded secrets or unusual control flows. The code structure is clear and typical of a benign utility.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, non-malicious Python script.",
