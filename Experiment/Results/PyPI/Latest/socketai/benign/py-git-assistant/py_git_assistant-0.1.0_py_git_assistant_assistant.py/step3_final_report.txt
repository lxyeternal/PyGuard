  "purpose": "A CLI dispatcher for git operations delegating tasks to external services based on user input.",
  "sources": "User input via safe_ask() and UIService.ask_main_menu()",
  "sinks": "External service methods (GitService.*) executing git commands",
  "flows": "Input from safe_ask() flows into match-case control structure, triggering corresponding GitService methods",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward command-line interface that delegates git operations to external modules. It uses safe input handling and standard control flow. No embedded malicious payloads or backdoors are present. The security assessment hinges on the external modules' implementation, which is not provided, but the code itself appears benign. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscation score as 0, and the security risk score as 0.2, reflecting low inherent risk typical for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for managing git repositories with no evidence of malicious activity. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. External dependencies should be audited separately, but the code snippet itself is safe.",
