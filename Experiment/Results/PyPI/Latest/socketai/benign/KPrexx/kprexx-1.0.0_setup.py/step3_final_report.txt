  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library using setuptools, primarily reading 'README.md' for the long description and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file via open('README.md').read()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data transmission",
  "flows": "Source: reading 'README.md' file; no data flows to sinks or external systems",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without exception handling; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no network operations, code execution, or malicious behavior. It reads a local file for description, which is standard. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with common packaging practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
