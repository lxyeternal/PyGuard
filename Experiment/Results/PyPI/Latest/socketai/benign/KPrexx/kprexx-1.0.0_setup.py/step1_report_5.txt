  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'KPrexx', used to specify package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package description from 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Reads description content from file and passes it to setup(); no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It reads package metadata, including long description from a file, and configures package details such as name, version, author, classifiers, and required Python version. No suspicious or malicious logic, no external data inputs beyond reading a static file, and no sensitive information or code injections present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and is typical for Python package distribution. No malicious behavior detected. It simply configures package metadata without any suspicious or malicious code.",
