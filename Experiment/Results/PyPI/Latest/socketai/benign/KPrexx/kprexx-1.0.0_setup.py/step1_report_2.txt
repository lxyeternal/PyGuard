{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'KPrexx' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs package setup operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md').read() without exception handling, but this is common in setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools to configure package metadata. It specifies package details, author info, description, and classifiers. The only file operation is reading 'README.md' for long description, which is standard. No network calls, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code structure is typical for Python package setup files, with no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard package setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
