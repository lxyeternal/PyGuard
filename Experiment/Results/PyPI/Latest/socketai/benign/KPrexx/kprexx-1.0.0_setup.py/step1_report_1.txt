  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no output or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Reading file 'README.md' as part of package setup; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read a local file for description is normal; no suspicious or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script for packaging a Python library. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. The only notable operation is reading a README.md file for the long description, which is typical. There are no network connections, credential handling, or code execution. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a conventional setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
