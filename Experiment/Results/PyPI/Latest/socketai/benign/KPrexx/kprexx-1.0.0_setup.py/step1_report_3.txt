The only file operation is reading 'README.md' for the long description, which is typical in setup scripts. There are no indications of code injection, data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. No suspicious logic or obfuscated code is present. The script is straightforward and standard for packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a normal package configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
