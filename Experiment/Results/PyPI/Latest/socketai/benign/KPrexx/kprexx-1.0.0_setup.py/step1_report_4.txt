  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'KPrexx' Python library, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description content.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data is being output or used in a way that affects system state.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' content during setup to include as long description; no other data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md').read() without exception handling; standard practice but notable in context of security analysis. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code features.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package configuration, defines package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and classifiers. It reads the long description from 'README.md' without further processing. No code injection, environment variable misuse, or malicious logic observed. The code appears to be a typical Python setup script, with standard use of 'find_packages()' for package discovery. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs package configuration and metadata assignment.",
