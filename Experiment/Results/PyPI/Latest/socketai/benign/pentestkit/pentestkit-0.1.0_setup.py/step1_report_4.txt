  "purpose": "Configure and set up the 'pentestkit' Python package for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading files: 'VERSION', 'requirements.txt', 'README.md'. No untrusted input handling is present; static configuration.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function defines package metadata and installation instructions. No direct data sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads version and dependencies from local files; passes static data to setup(). No dynamic data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code strictly reads local files and supplies static configuration data to setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The script defines helper functions to read local files for version, requirements, and description, then passes these to setup(). No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution observed. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues. It simply configures package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious logic or data handling.",
