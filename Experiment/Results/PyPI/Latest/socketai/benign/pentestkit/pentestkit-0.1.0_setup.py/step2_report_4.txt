  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Functionality Confirmation:**\n\n- The code reads static files: VERSION, requirements.txt, README.md.\n- It uses these to configure the package via setuptools.setup().\n- No dynamic code execution, no user input handling, no network activity.\n- The functions are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.\n\n**2. Presence of Issues or Anomalies:**\n\n- The code appears standard and benign.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscated code are detected.\n- All operations are typical for a setup script.\n\n**3. Review of the Security Reports:**\n\n- All reports uniformly state that the script is a standard setup configuration.\n- They confirm no handling of untrusted data, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, and no malware.\n- They consistently rate the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty in their assessments.\n\n**4. Logical Flaws or Mistakes in Reports:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and thorough; no logical flaws are evident.\n- They correctly identify that the script reads static files and configures package metadata without executing untrusted code.\n\n**5. Score Justification:**\n\n- All scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**6. Additional Critical Evaluation:**\n\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis is sound.\n- No signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent are present.\n- The code is a typical, well-structured setup script.\n\n**7. Final Assessment:**\n\nBased on all the above, I agree with the reports' conclusions and scores.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
