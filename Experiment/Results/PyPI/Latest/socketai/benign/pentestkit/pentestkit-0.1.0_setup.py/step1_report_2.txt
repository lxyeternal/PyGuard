{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'pentestkit', designed to facilitate API penetration testing with Swagger files.",
  "sources": "Reading files: VERSION, requirements.txt, README.md; Reading package metadata and dependencies; Calling setup() with package info.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly handles untrusted user input or data; the setup process involves file reading and package configuration only.",
  "flows": "File contents (version, requirements, description) are read and used to configure the package; no untrusted data flows into executable or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version info from a local file, reads dependencies from a requirements file, and the long description from README.md. It then calls setuptools.setup() with various metadata and configuration options. There are no signs of malicious activity, no network connections, code injections, or backdoors. All operations are typical for a Python package setup script. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted input or perform any unsafe operations. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
