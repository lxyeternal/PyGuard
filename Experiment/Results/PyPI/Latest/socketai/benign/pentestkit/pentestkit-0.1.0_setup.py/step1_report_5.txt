{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python library called 'pentestkit' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'VERSION' file, requirements from 'requirements.txt', long description from 'README.md', and package data from the 'src' directory.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data is written or transmitted; setup parameters are standard for packaging.",
  "flows": "Reads data from local files and supplies them to setup() without transforming or executing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The script performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script reads external files to gather package metadata and dependencies, then calls setup() with this data. It does not execute or evaluate untrusted code, does not include network operations, or manipulate environment variables beyond standard setup procedures. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to facilitate packaging and distribution of the library.",
