{
  "purpose": "This setup script is for configuring the packaging of a Python library aimed at API penetration testing using Swagger files.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'VERSION' file, reading requirements from 'requirements.txt', reading long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; the script mainly reads static files and sets up package metadata.",
  "flows": "Read static files -> provide data to setup() -> package configuration; no untrusted data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code reads files and sets metadata without executing untrusted code or including hidden instructions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines helper functions to read version, requirements, and description from static files, and then calls setup() with package configuration. All operations involve static file reading and package setup parameters. There are no dynamic code executions, no handling of untrusted input, and no suspicious logic or obfuscated code present. The use of well-known setup tools and standard practices indicates a normal, benign package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script appears to be a legitimate package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only reads static files and sets up package metadata without executing or processing untrusted input.",
