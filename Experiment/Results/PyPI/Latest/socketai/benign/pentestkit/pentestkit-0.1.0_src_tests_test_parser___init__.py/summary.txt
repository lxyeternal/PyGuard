  "conclusion": "The assessments are generally appropriate. To improve accuracy, if Report 1's eval()/exec() usage is confirmed, the malware score should be increased to reflect higher malicious potential, possibly to 0.4-0.5, and the overall security risk adjusted accordingly. Other reports are correctly scored given their content. The current scores are justified, but slight adjustments are recommended based on actual code confirmation."
