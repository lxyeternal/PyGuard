  "purpose": "Analysis of potential malicious behavior or security risks in the provided Python code snippets, focusing on supply chain concerns such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Untrusted data inputs such as environment variables, user inputs, external files, network data, and code execution functions like eval()/exec().",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, subprocess calls, environment modifications, and potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks (outputs or system calls), especially via eval()/exec() or insecure data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, obfuscated variable names, hardcoded credentials, empty or suspiciously minimal files, and lack of code in some snippets.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify the presence or absence of malicious indicators. Reports 2-5 show no significant issues, with scores reflecting benign or empty code. Report 1 raises suspicion of dynamic code execution, but without explicit code snippets, the concern remains speculative. Given the suspicion of eval()/exec() in Report 1, the malware score should be increased if such functions are confirmed to be used insecurely. The overall security risk is moderate due to potential code injection vectors. The confidence scores align with the evidence, with higher confidence in benign reports and moderate confidence in the suspicious one.",
  "conclusion": "The assessments are generally appropriate. To improve accuracy, if Report 1's eval()/exec() usage is confirmed, the malware score should be increased to reflect higher malicious potential, possibly to 0.4-0.5, and the overall security risk adjusted accordingly. Other reports are correctly scored given their content. The current scores are justified, but slight adjustments are recommended based on actual code confirmation.",
