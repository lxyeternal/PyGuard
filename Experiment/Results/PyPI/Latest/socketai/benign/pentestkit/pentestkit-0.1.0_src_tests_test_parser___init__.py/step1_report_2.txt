  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a generic Python script potentially used for data processing or automation.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, user input prompts, or external files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (e.g., sending data over sockets or HTTP requests), file writes, or subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to processing functions, then potentially to output sinks such as network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. No obfuscated code patterns or unusual language features detected. No obvious malicious code like system modifications, reverse shells, or data exfiltration routines found.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with typical structure for data processing tasks. It does not contain suspicious external network activity, code injection, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No anomalous patterns or security risks identified. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated sections. Overall, the code behaves as expected for benign operations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, non-malicious script. No evidence of malware or suspicious activity was found.",
