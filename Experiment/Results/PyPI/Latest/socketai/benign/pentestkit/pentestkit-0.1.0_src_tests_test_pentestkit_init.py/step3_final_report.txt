  "purpose": "Unit tests for verifying the __version__ attribute in the pentestkit module, handling scenarios like missing or unreadable version files.",
  "sources": "File reading via open(), path manipulation with os.path.join, module import and reload with importlib.reload.",
  "sinks": "Module attribute assignment (__version__), print statements for error handling, module reloads.",
  "flows": "Reading version from file, updating __version__, handling exceptions, reloading module to reset state.",
  "anomalies": "Use of mocking and patching for filesystem interactions; no malicious code or backdoors detected; use of print() for error reporting in tests.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward testing logic employing standard mocking and reloading techniques to verify version handling. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. Exception handling via print is typical in tests. The code does not contain obfuscation or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate safe, standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for testing version retrieval logic, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scoring of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 is appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
