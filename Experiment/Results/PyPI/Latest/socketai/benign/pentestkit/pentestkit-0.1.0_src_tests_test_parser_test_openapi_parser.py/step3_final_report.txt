  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the OpenAPIParser class, validating parsing correctness and error handling using static JSON files.",
  "sources": "Reading local JSON files containing API specifications; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; no network or system calls.",
  "flows": "Loading JSON data into parser objects, then performing assertions; no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of controlled test cases operating on static, trusted JSON files. It performs validation without executing untrusted code or external interactions. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The tests are standard and well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate safety, and the current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified.",
