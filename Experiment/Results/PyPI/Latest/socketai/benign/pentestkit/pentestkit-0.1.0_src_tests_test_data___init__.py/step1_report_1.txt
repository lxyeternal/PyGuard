{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or comments, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include environment variables, user inputs, or external files (if present). Since no specific input functions or file reads are visible, sources are minimal.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls if present. No explicit network or file operations are detected in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are identifiable within the code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behavior based on static analysis. It does not contain any code that attempts to exfiltrate data, establish network connections, or modify system files. The absence of obfuscation and suspicious API calls supports a benign interpretation. The only potential concern is the lack of comments or unclear purpose, but that does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the static review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign Python script with no evident supply chain threats or malicious intent.",
