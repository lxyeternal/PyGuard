  "purpose": "Define expected endpoint-method pairs for parser tests of a pet store API (version 2 and 3).",
  "sources": "Constant dictionaries PETSTORE_V2_EXPECTED_ENDPOINTS and PETSTORE_V3_EXPECTED_ENDPOINTS containing tuples of endpoint paths and HTTP methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input/output or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink as there are only static constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of two static sets defining endpoint-method pairs for testing purposes. These are hardcoded data structures with no dynamic execution, no input handling, no data processing, and no external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code injection, or security risks. The structure and content are straightforward and intended for test validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely defining static constants for testing API endpoints and methods. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
