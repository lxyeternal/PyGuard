  "purpose": "Define expected API endpoint-method pairs for testing purposes in a pet store API project.",
  "sources": "Constants defining sets of endpoint-path and method tuples",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines static data structures",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code is simple data declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code declares two constants, PETSTORE_V2_EXPECTED_ENDPOINTS and PETSTORE_V3_EXPECTED_ENDPOINTS, each as a set of tuples representing API endpoint paths and HTTP methods. These sets serve as expected values for parser tests, with no dynamic code, input handling, or external data references. No malicious patterns, code injections, or backdoors are evident. The code appears to be purely declarative, intended for testing validation of API routes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of expected API endpoints for testing, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply contains static data definitions relevant to test assertions.",
