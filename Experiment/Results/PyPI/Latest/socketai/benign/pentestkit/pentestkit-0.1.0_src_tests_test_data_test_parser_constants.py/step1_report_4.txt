  "purpose": "Define expected endpoint-HTTP method pairs for pet store API version 2 and 3 tests.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions assigning sets of tuples representing endpoints and methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static data assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static set definitions containing string tuples. No input handling, no data processing, no external calls, and no dynamic code execution are present. The constants appear to serve as test data for API endpoint validation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is straightforward and lacks any obfuscated or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static test data definitions for API endpoint expectations. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
