  "purpose": "Static definitions of expected API endpoints and methods for Petstore API versions 2 and 3, used as test constants.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only contains predefined set literals.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external data or perform I/O.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static data with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static set definitions listing endpoint-path and method tuples for testing purposes. There are no dynamic elements, external data handling, or executable logic. The code is benign, serving as constants for API testing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, static test data with no security or malicious concerns. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and do not require adjustments.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
