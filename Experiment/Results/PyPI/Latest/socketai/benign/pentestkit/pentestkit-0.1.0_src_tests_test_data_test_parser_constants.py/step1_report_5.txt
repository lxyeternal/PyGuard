  "purpose": "Define expected endpoint and method combinations for parser tests related to PETSTORE API versions 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions for PETSTORE_V2_EXPECTED_ENDPOINTS and PETSTORE_V3_EXPECTED_ENDPOINTS.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data inputs or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only assigns constant sets.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two set definitions containing tuples of endpoint paths and HTTP methods for testing purposes. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no external communications. The data appears to be static test constants. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static test data for API endpoint validation. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
