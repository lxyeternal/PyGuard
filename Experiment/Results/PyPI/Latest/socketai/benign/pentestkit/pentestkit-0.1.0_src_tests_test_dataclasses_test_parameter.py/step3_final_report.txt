{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive set of unit tests for functions generating test and example values based on parameter specifications, including types, patterns, enums, and constraints.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from Parameter objects and predefined patterns/enums within test cases.",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks or untrusted data flows; the code only generates and validates test data locally.",
  "flows": "Source data (Parameter definitions) flows into generate_test_value and generate_example_value functions, which produce values validated against patterns and constraints.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests verifying value generation functions for various parameter types, formats, and constraints. It does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. Patterns and enums are static and used for testing purposes. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and purpose-specific, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing parameter value generation, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, aligning with the evidence.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
