  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign or ambiguous, with Reports 3 and 5 showing signs of obfuscation and potential malicious behavior. The scoring aligns well with the evidence, though Report 3's malware score could be marginally increased to 0.5 to better reflect suspicion. Overall, the assessments are appropriate, and further static/dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious code before deployment."
