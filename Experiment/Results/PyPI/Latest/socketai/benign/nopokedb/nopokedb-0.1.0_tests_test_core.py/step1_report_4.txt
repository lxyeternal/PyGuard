  "purpose": "Unit testing the NoPokeDB class for adding and querying vectors using pytest framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input vectors from variables and creates temporary directory paths via pytest fixtures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating potential malicious data flow; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input data (vectors) flow into db.add() and db.query() methods; error handling flows also occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of test functions using pytest to verify functionality of the NoPokeDB class. It creates a temporary directory for testing, adds vectors, performs queries, and checks for exceptions with invalid inputs. No external data is fetched or sent; no obfuscated code or malicious patterns are evident. The use of np and pytest is standard for testing numerical code. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for a database class, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate testing code with no security concerns.",
