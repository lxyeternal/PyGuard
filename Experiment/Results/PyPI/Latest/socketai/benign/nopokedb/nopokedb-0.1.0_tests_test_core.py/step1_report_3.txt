  "purpose": "Unit testing for the NoPokeDB class, including adding and querying vectors, using pytest fixtures.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from test functions, including vectors and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling that could lead to leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Test input vectors flow into db.add() and db.query(); results are checked within assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors, standard testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical unit testing of a database class with numpy arrays and pytest fixtures. It does not contain obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or security-related vulnerabilities. It tests standard behaviors such as adding vectors, querying, and error handling. No signs of malware, supply chain attacks, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard test code for a Python database class, with no malicious intent or security risks observed.",
