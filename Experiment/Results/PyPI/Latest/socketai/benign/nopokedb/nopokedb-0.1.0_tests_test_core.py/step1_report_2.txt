{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the NoPokeDB class, including adding vectors, querying, and handling errors.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, temporary directory for database storage.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects; tests involve normal operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows include passing vectors and metadata into add/query functions and handling exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscation or unusual language features. Tests are standard usage.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical unit tests for a database class using pytest fixtures and numpy arrays. No external data sources, environment variables, or network calls are present. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. Usage of temporary paths and standard testing patterns suggest normal testing practices. No anomalies or suspicious code structures identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of unit tests for the NoPokeDB class, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It adheres to standard testing procedures without suspicious behavior.",
