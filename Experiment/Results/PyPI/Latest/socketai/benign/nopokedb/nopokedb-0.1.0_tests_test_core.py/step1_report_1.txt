{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the NoPokeDB class, verifying adding and querying vectors, handling errors.",
  "sources": "pytest fixtures, db methods (add, query), numpy array creation",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output functions that could leak data or execute malicious code",
  "flows": "Test functions generate input data, call db methods, and check results; no external data flow or untrusted input processing",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors; test code is standard and does not contain hidden malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code defines test functions using pytest, creating a temporary database instance with a fixture. It tests adding vectors, querying, and handling errors. Usage of numpy and pytest is standard. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No evidence of code obfuscation or malicious payloads. The code appears solely to verify functionality of the NoPokeDB class, with no harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, designed for testing the NoPokeDB class functionalities. There are no signs of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code does not perform any suspicious actions or data leaks.",
