  "purpose": "Module initialization for the NoPokeDB package, setting version and importing core class.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and the relative import from '.core'.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "flows": "The code assigns a version string and imports a class; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for a package init file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package initialization file defining a version and importing a core class. No dynamic code, data processing, external communication, or suspicious patterns are present. The import is relative and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The minimal structure and absence of external data or network activity indicate a benign and secure module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
