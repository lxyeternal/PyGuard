{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a minimal Python module that defines a package version and imports a core class or function from a local module called 'core'.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the import statement 'from .core import NoPokeDB', which imports an object from a local module file.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that process untrusted input or data; no external connections, data processing, or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code simply imports a class or function and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code is minimal, straightforward, and lacks any complex or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and imports 'NoPokeDB' from a local module. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is evident. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The structure is standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign package initialization file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily serves to expose 'NoPokeDB' and define a version.",
