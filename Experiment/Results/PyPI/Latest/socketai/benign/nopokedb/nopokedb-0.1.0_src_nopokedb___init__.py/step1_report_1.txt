{
  "purpose": "Defines a package version and imports the core module of the NoPokeDB package.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as no input handling or data processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports a core class or module from the same package. There is no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no external data handling. It appears to be a simple module initialization file. The lack of any active logic or data handling reduces risk. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, serving as a basic module initialization with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
