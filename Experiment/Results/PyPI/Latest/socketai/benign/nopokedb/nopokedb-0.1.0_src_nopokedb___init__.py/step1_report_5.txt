  "flows": "No data flow pathways; only a module import statement",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code contains a module-level docstring, version declaration, and an import statement for a core component. It does not include any data handling, input, output, or executable logic. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present. The import is relative, suggesting internal code structure, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module declaration with no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or security risks.",
