{
  "purpose": "Define a module with versioning and import a core class or function for NoPokeDB functionality",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core import NoPokeDB",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data handling or output functions present",
  "flows": "No data flow present; the code only imports a component",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; very minimal code structure",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports a class or function from a local module. There are no inputs, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, or network interactions. The import is relative, which is standard for package internal structure. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious functions, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module initialization code with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate package setup fragment.",
