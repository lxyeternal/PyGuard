  "purpose": "Define the module's version and import the core functionality of the NoPokeDB package.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply defines metadata and imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a module-level version string and a single import statement from a local core module. There are no dynamic code executions, hardcoded secrets, or data manipulations. The import statement is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. The file's simplicity and lack of suspicious constructs suggest normal behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, serving to set version information and import core functionality. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
