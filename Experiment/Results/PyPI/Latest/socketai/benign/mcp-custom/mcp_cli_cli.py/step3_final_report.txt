  "purpose": "CLI management and server control for MCP, including dynamic import, subprocess execution, environment handling, and file parsing.",
  "sources": "User inputs for file paths, environment variables, and command options; file system for file existence; environment variables; subprocess commands; dynamic module import.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing external commands; dynamic module loading; environment variable setting; file access and validation.",
  "flows": "User input (file_spec, env_vars) influences file parsing and module import; validated file paths are used for import; command arguments influence subprocess execution; environment variables are set from user input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shell=True in subprocess calls on Windows, dynamic import based on user-supplied paths and object names, minimal input validation on file paths and module names, no explicit sanitization of command arguments.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard CLI functions with controlled subprocess and import mechanisms. It validates file existence and handles errors appropriately. The subprocess commands are constructed from validated inputs, though the use of shell=True on Windows introduces some risk if inputs are maliciously crafted. Dynamic import based on user input could be exploited if malicious files are provided, but no malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. Overall, the code is typical for CLI tools managing server processes, with moderate inherent risks due to dynamic execution pathways.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate CLI tool for managing MCP servers, with no evidence of malicious payloads or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the potential for exploitation via crafted inputs affecting subprocess commands and dynamic imports, especially with shell=True on Windows. However, controls such as path validation mitigate some risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is moderate (~0.3), reflecting the inherent risks of dynamic code execution but no active malicious behavior.",
