  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking their conclusions with the code and considering the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script performs standard CLI functions, with dynamic module import, subprocess calls, environment variable handling, and error management. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are evident.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior, with a high confidence (0.9). The malware score is 0, which aligns with the conclusion. The security risk is low (0.2), justified by controlled subprocess usage and input validation.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues; the report's scoring and reasoning are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing dynamic import and subprocess invocation based on user inputs, but still no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The confidence is high (0.9), malware score 0, security risk 0.2. The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior—dynamic imports are based on validated paths, subprocess calls are controlled, and no malicious payloads are detected.\n\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights potential risks from subprocess with user-controlled commands and dynamic imports, noting that inputs are not extensively validated.\n\n- **Assessment:** The confidence is moderate (0.7), and the security risk is higher (0.55). This is justified because:\n\n  - The subprocess calls involve external commands ('npx') with arguments constructed from user inputs, which could be manipulated if inputs are malicious.\n\n  - The use of `shell=True` on Windows increases risk if inputs are crafted maliciously.\n\n  - Dynamic import of user-specified files and object names, while validated for existence, could still be exploited if malicious files are provided.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report reasonably assesses the potential attack surface, assigning a higher security risk due to these factors.\n\n- **Verdict:** The scores are appropriate given the potential for exploitation through crafted inputs.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, noting dynamic import and subprocess execution, with a low malware score but acknowledging potential risks.\n\n- **Assessment:** Confidence is high (0.9), malware score 0, security risk 0.2. The reasoning is sound; the code's operations are typical for CLI tools, with no embedded malicious payloads. Risks are mainly from dynamic import and subprocess execution, but controls seem adequate.\n\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the potential for code execution via dynamic import and subprocess calls, especially if malicious files are supplied, but finds no evidence of malicious payloads.\n\n- **Assessment:** Confidence is moderate (0.75), malware score 0, security risk 0.4. This reflects a cautious stance, acknowledging that while no malicious code is embedded, the design allows for code execution if inputs are compromised.\n\n- **Verdict:** The scoring aligns with the analysis; the risk is moderate due to the nature of dynamic imports and subprocess calls.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct; no malicious code or payloads are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, which is appropriate; no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Varies from low (~0.2) to moderate (~0.55). The higher score in Report 3 is justified by the potential for exploitation via crafted inputs, especially considering subprocess with shell=True and dynamic imports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code performs typical CLI management functions with controlled subprocess and import mechanisms.\n\n- The main security concern is the handling of user-supplied file paths and command arguments, which could be exploited if malicious files or inputs are provided.\n\n- The use of `shell=True` on Windows in subprocess calls warrants caution but is not inherently malicious.\n\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious payloads detected)\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation observed)\n\n- **Risk Score:** **0.4** (moderate, due to dynamic imports and subprocess risks, but controls are in place)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate CLI tool with standard patterns, and while it involves dynamic execution based on user input, it does not contain malicious behavior. The main security concern is ensuring inputs are sanitized and that subprocess calls are safe, which appears reasonably handled here.",
