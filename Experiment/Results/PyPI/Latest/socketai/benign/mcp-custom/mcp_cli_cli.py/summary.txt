  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate CLI tool for managing MCP servers, with no evidence of malicious payloads or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the potential for exploitation via crafted inputs affecting subprocess commands and dynamic imports, especially with shell=True on Windows. However, controls such as path validation mitigate some risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is moderate (~0.3), reflecting the inherent risks of dynamic code execution but no active malicious behavior."
