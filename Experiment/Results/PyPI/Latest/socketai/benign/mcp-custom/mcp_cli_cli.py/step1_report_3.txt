  "purpose": "This script provides command-line tools for managing MCP development servers, including running, installing, and version querying.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments, environment variable strings, file paths, and optional environment files.",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess commands, dynamic importing of modules and objects, and environment variable setting, which could affect system behavior or environment.",
  "flows": "Input data (file paths, environment variables, command options) flows into functions that build commands or import modules, which are then executed or imported dynamically. Data from user inputs or environment files influences subprocess calls and imported objects.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports modules and objects based on user input without explicit validation, which could potentially be exploited if malicious files are provided. Use of subprocess.run with shell=True on Windows could execute arbitrary commands if inputs are manipulated. Environment variable parsing appears straightforward, but no validation of values occurs beyond format check.",
  "analysis": "The code reads user-supplied file paths, environment variables, and command options, then performs dynamic imports and subprocess executions. It constructs commands based on user input, such as file specifications and environment variables, and executes external processes (like npx and subprocess calls). The dynamic import mechanism resolves modules and objects based on user input, which could be manipulated if malicious files or object names are supplied. The subprocess call uses shell=True on Windows, increasing risk if input commands are tampered with. Environment variables are parsed but not sanitized beyond format validation. Overall, the code relies heavily on user-provided data to execute system commands and import modules, which could be exploited if malicious files or inputs are provided.",
  "conclusion": "While the code primarily handles standard command-line operations for managing MCP servers, its use of dynamic importing based on user input and subprocess execution with user-controlled parameters introduces potential security risks. The main concern is the possibility of executing malicious code via crafted file paths, object names, or commands, especially given the use of shell=True on Windows. Proper validation and sanitization are lacking, and no explicit security controls prevent malicious inputs from affecting the system. Therefore, the code poses a moderate security risk, mainly through dynamic imports and subprocess execution pathways.",
