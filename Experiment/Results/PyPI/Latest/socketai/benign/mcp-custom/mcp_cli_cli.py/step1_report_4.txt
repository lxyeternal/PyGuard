  "purpose": "The script provides command-line tools for managing MCP servers, including running, installing, and version checking, with integration to tools like Claude and environment variable management.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments, environment variables, dotenv files, and file paths parsed from user input.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include subprocess calls (for executing npx commands), importing modules (dynamic import of server files), and executing server.run() methods, which could be exploited if malicious code is imported or executed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (file_spec, env_vars, dotenv files) into module imports, subprocess execution, and server methods; untrusted data could influence module import paths or subprocess commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or backdoors are present. The code uses dynamic imports and subprocess calls, which are standard but should be scrutinized in context; no obfuscated code detected. The subprocess commands execute external tools like 'npx' with user-supplied arguments, which could be manipulated if inputs are not validated, but current validation appears minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports server modules based on user-provided file paths and optional object names, then executes server methods or runs subprocess commands for server management tasks. The subprocess calls use external commands like 'npx', but the arguments are constructed from controlled functions and arguments, with no apparent injection points. The dynamic import uses user-supplied file paths, but these are validated to ensure they exist and are files, not directories. Environment variables are handled carefully, with options to load from dotenv files or command line inputs, and are incorporated into subprocess environments securely. The code uses standard Python practices without obfuscation or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are evident. The subprocess calls are potentially risky if inputs are maliciously crafted, but safeguards appear reasonable. Overall, the code is a typical CLI wrapper with dynamic module handling and subprocess execution, with no evident malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI tool for managing MCP servers with dynamic imports and subprocess execution. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or sabotage. While subprocess calls and dynamic imports could pose risks if exploited, current validation and practices appear reasonable. No malware or malicious behavior detected. Overall security risk is low.",
