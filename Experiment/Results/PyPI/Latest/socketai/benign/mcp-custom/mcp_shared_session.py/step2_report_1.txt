  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to assess potential security risks, malware presence, obfuscation, and overall integrity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements an MCP protocol session handler; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected; use of in-memory streams and async handling appear standard; handling of CancelledNotification is legitimate within protocol context.\n- **Risk/Malware/Obfuscated:** All scores are zero; confidence high (0.9).\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's structure. No malicious or obfuscated code is evident. Cancellation handling seems appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard request/response handling; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns; proper use of context managers and cancellation.\n- **Risk/Malware/Obfuscated:** All zero; confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on request/response lifecycle, notifications, and low malicious potential; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; low risk.\n- **Risk/Malware/Obfuscated:** All zero; confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The code's structure and handling align with this assessment.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a standard asynchronous message handler; no evidence of malicious behavior; proper management of request lifecycle and cancellation.\n- **Risk/Malware/Obfuscated:** All zero; confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes standard request/response handling, cancellation, no suspicious external calls or obfuscation; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Risk/Malware/Obfuscated:** All zero; confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis matches the code's characteristics.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code's structure—standard async request/response over in-memory streams, with no external network calls, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports; the code is clear, structured, and uses standard patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in all reports, reflecting minimal inherent risks due to asynchronous handling and cancellation features, but nothing indicating security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — Code is straightforward, well-structured.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Low risk, typical for such protocols; no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be a legitimate, secure implementation of an MCP session handler. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The provided scores in the reports are consistent with the code's characteristics.",
