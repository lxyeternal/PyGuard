  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code is a straightforward custom exception class `McpError` that encapsulates an `ErrorData` object.\n   - It imports `ErrorData` from `mcp.types` and uses its `message` attribute to initialize the exception.\n   - The class stores the entire `ErrorData` object as an attribute for further inspection if needed.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected across all reports.\n   - No external data sources or untrusted data handling beyond passing an object into the constructor, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No errors or flaws are identified. The implementation is typical and correct for a custom exception class.\n   - The only potential concern is whether `ErrorData.message` could contain untrusted data, but this is a standard pattern—exceptions often include messages from external sources. The reports correctly identify that this is benign.\n\n3. **Scores evaluation:**\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or risky behavior.\n   - The code is a simple exception wrapper with no external calls, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n   - Therefore, scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n   - The only assumption is that `ErrorData.message` is safe to include in an exception message. If `ErrorData.message` contains malicious data, it could cause issues in some contexts (e.g., injection in logs). However, this is a common pattern, and unless `ErrorData` is from an untrusted source, this is not a security concern.\n   - The reports do not identify any such issues.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - All reports assign scores consistent with their analysis.\n   - The overall assessment aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of a custom exception class.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. No changes are necessary.",
