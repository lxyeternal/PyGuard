  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the original code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward custom exception class.\n- The code imports ErrorData from mcp.types, initializes the exception with error.message, and stores the ErrorData object.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected across reports.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the findings, with malware and security risk scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code matches the original code snippet exactly.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- The logic is simple and standard for custom exception classes.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No errors or flaws are identified.\n- The reports correctly note that passing `error.message` to the base class constructor is standard, but it assumes `ErrorData.message` is safe and properly sanitized. Since `ErrorData` is imported and used internally, and there's no evidence of untrusted data handling, this is acceptable.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, which is appropriate.\n- Confidence scores are high (0.9 to 1), reflecting the clear understanding.\n- Obfuscated = 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- All scores for malware and security risk are 0, which is justified.\n- The overall risk score is 0, as no security issues are present.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- The reports do not assume any malicious activity from the code, which is correct.\n- The only potential concern could be if `ErrorData.message` contains malicious content, but given this is a data object, and the code merely passes it to the Exception constructor, the risk is minimal and standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a typical pattern for custom exceptions, encapsulating error data.\n- No external or untrusted data handling beyond the ErrorData object is involved.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, data leaks, or code injection.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. I concur with the assessments that this code is benign, straightforward, and free of security issues or malicious intent.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
