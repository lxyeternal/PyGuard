  "purpose": "A custom exception class 'McpError' encapsulating 'ErrorData' for error handling over MCP connections.",
  "sources": "ErrorData.message used as exception message",
  "sinks": "Exception message output (e.g., logs, error displays)",
  "flows": "ErrorData object passed into constructor -> error.message used in super().__init__()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward class definition",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception 'McpError' that stores an 'ErrorData' object and initializes the exception message with 'ErrorData.message'. It imports 'ErrorData' from 'mcp.types' and does not perform any external data handling or network activity. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are present. The use of 'error.message' assumes the message is safe, which is standard in exception handling. The code is minimal and correct, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, consistent across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a custom exception class with no malicious or security issues. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and justified.",
