  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for errors received over an MCP connection, encapsulating an ErrorData object.",
  "sources": "Import statement from mcp.types and the ErrorData object used in the exception class.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "ErrorData object is passed into the constructor and stored as an attribute; no further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual coding patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class, defines a straightforward custom exception that takes an ErrorData object, and sets its message based on ErrorData.message. No external data sources, untrusted input processing, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears standard and simple with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a basic, safe custom exception definition with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
