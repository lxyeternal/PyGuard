  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, importing ErrorData, defining a custom exception class, passing error.message to the base Exception, and storing the ErrorData object.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- The code is simple, with no external data handling beyond the ErrorData object passed into the constructor.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- The code matches the original code snippet.\n- No issues or discrepancies are found between the reports and the code.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n\n- None detected. The code is a standard custom exception class, with no logical errors or security flaws.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Malware score:** All assign 0, consistent with no malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Justifications:\n\n- The code does not perform any external network activity, data leaks, or code injection.\n- It does not handle untrusted data beyond the ErrorData object, which is passed in explicitly.\n- The ErrorData object’s internal structure is unknown, but its usage here is safe as it only provides a message for the exception.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- The reports assume ErrorData.message is safe to use as the exception message. Without knowing ErrorData's implementation, this is generally acceptable if ErrorData.message is a string, but if ErrorData.message could contain malicious content, that might be a concern. However, in typical exception handling, passing message strings is standard practice.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe custom exception class with no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** All reports are accurate and consistent. No changes needed.",
