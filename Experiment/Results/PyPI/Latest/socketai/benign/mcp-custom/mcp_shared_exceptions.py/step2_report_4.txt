  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a straightforward custom exception class that encapsulates an ErrorData object. The code imports ErrorData from mcp.types, defines the class McpError inheriting from Exception, and initializes it with an ErrorData instance, setting the message to ErrorData.message. There are no indications of code anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors.  \n**Conclusion:** The code matches the original and no issues are present.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is simple, standard, and safe.  \n- They mention that the error message passed to the superclass is derived from ErrorData.message, which could be untrusted if ErrorData.message is externally controlled. However, since ErrorData is imported from a module and not directly from untrusted input, this is a standard pattern.  \n- No report claims any actual vulnerabilities, just that the code is benign.\n\n**3. Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the analysis.  \n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the straightforward code.  \n- Confidence scores are high (0.9 to 1), reflecting the clear understanding.  \n**Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n- The highest risk score is 0, indicating no security concern.  \n- No reason to increase the risk score; the code is safe.\n\n**5. Malware Score Justification:**  \n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.  \n- The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n\n**6. Challenging Assumptions About Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The reports assume that passing ErrorData.message to the base Exception is safe. Since ErrorData is imported from a presumably trusted module, and the message is a string, this is acceptable.  \n- No assumptions about untrusted input are made, and no data leaks or injections are evident.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \n- All scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.  \n**Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Overall Justification:**  \nThe code is a standard pattern for custom exceptions, with no suspicious behavior, no external untrusted data handling beyond the imported ErrorData object, and no obfuscation. The reports correctly identify this.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is safe, simple, and standard.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0. The code poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to generate a summarized report or any further analysis?**",
