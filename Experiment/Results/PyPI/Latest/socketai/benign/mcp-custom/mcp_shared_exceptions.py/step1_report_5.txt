  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors received over an MCP connection.",
  "sources": "Importing ErrorData from mcp.types; initializing the error attribute with ErrorData object",
  "sinks": "Super constructor call with error.message; storing ErrorData object in self.error",
  "flows": "ErrorData instance passed to constructor -> super().__init__() with error.message -> storing ErrorData in self.error",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward class definition with standard exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class McpError that extends Exception. It takes an ErrorData object as input, sets its message as the exception message, and stores the ErrorData object for further reference. The code uses standard Python exception handling practices and imports ErrorData from a presumably safe module. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. The class appears to serve as a simple error wrapper for MCP communication errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
