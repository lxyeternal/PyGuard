  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward custom exception class, importing ErrorData and encapsulating it in an exception.\n- The code simply passes `error.message` to the base Exception and stores the ErrorData object.\n- No untrusted data handling, external network calls, or data leaks are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears correct, safe, and as intended for a typical error wrapper.\n\n---\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they do not contain logical errors or misinterpretations.\n- They correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Confidence: mostly 1, some 0.9, which is reasonable.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, appropriate.\n  - Malware: 0, consistent with the analysis.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0, justified given the code's simplicity.\n- These scores seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is correct.\n- The code is purely for error encapsulation, with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**5. Malware Score Justification:**\n- All reports assign malware score 0, which is correct.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity or contain malicious payloads.\n\n**6. Challenging Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- No claims are made that suggest vulnerabilities based on assumptions; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n- The only potential concern could be the use of `error.message`—if `ErrorData.message` were untrusted, passing it directly to the exception message could be a minor concern, but in the context of error handling, this is standard practice.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk identified.\n\n**Estimated Scores (my judgment):**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal, standard custom exception class that safely encapsulates an error object. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The overall security posture of this code is very high; it is a typical pattern for error handling in Python, with no malicious or risky behavior.",
