  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling MCP connection errors.",
  "sources": "Import of ErrorData from mcp.types, and the constructor parameter error.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(error.message) potentially passing untrusted data to base class constructor.",
  "flows": "ErrorData object is passed into the constructor, and error.message is used as the exception message.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The class is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a data structure ErrorData and defines a custom exception class McpError. The constructor initializes the exception with the message from the ErrorData object. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. The usage is typical for custom exception handling. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious data flows, or code injection. Since ErrorData is imported from an external module, without additional context, no malicious activity can be inferred from its usage here.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines a simple, benign custom exception class with standard behavior. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The implementation appears safe and typical for error handling.",
