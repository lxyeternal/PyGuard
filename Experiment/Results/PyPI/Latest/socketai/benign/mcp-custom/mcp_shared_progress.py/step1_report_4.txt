{
  "purpose": "Provides a context manager and data structures for tracking and sending progress updates during asynchronous operations within a session-based framework.",
  "sources": "Reads progress tokens from request context metadata, accesses session methods to send progress notifications.",
  "sinks": "Calls session.send_progress_notification, which could potentially send data over the network.",
  "flows": "ProgressContext.progress method updates internal state and calls session.send_progress_notification with progress data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code appears to be standard progress tracking logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes and context managers for managing progress updates in a session. It uses type hints and external session methods to send progress notifications. No untrusted data sources or malicious behaviors detected. The code primarily handles internal state and communicates progress via session methods, which are assumed to be standard and secure. No unusual or suspicious code constructs, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate progress-tracking logic intended for use within a session-based application. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It is a standard implementation of progress updates with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
