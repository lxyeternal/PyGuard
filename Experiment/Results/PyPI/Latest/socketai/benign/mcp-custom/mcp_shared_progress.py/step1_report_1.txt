{
  "purpose": "The code provides a context manager and class for tracking and sending progress notifications within a session, likely in an asynchronous request processing environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the context parameter 'ctx', specifically 'ctx.meta' and 'ctx.meta.progressToken'. It also reads from the session object 'session' within the context.",
  "sinks": "The 'send_progress_notification' method is called as a sink, potentially sending untrusted progress data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input is obtained from 'ctx.meta.progressToken' and 'total'. This data is used in 'ProgressContext' and sent via 'session.send_progress_notification'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The use of 'try' and 'finally' with an empty block is somewhat redundant but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and imports; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present. It safely checks for 'meta' and 'progressToken' presence before proceeding. The progress notification is sent asynchronously via the session object. The structure and logic appear typical for progress reporting in a client-server or API context. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a progress tracking context manager for asynchronous session communication. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
