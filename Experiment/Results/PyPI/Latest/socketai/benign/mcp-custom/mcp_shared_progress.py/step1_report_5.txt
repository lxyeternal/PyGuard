{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for managing progress updates within a session-based request context, likely in an asynchronous environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, context parameters (ctx), and progress tokens. It also accesses session methods for sending notifications.",
  "sinks": "The session's 'send_progress_notification' method, which could potentially transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "The progress method updates internal state and calls 'send_progress_notification', which could transmit data to an external recipient.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard libraries and pydantic for data validation appears normal. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python practices for context management and data modeling. It safely handles progress updates, raising an error if no progress token is provided. The 'send_progress_notification' is called asynchronously with updated progress data. No malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration or malicious network activity, are evident. The overall structure is straightforward, with no suspicious code patterns or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation for progress reporting in a session-based request system. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within the provided snippet.",
