  "purpose": "Progress tracking and notification within an asynchronous request/session framework, using context managers and data classes to send progress updates via session methods.",
  "sources": "Reads from ctx.meta and ctx.session, specifically ctx.meta.progressToken and total/amount parameters.",
  "sinks": "Calls session.send_progress_notification with progress data, which could be a sink for untrusted data if misused.",
  "flows": "Source data from ctx.meta and context parameters flows into send_progress_notification via the progress() method in ProgressContext.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward. The empty 'finally' block in the context manager is redundant but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard progress notification pattern using async context managers and data classes. It performs necessary checks for presence of progress tokens and sends updates via session methods. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The call to send_progress_notification is a typical sink for progress data. The overall structure and behavior are benign, with low security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's intent and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward progress reporting utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or high security risk. The existing assessments and scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
