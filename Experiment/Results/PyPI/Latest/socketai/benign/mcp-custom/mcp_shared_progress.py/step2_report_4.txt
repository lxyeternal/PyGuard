  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code implements a progress reporting mechanism using a context manager and data classes.\n- It interacts with external session objects to send progress notifications.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden backdoors.\n- The code relies on external, presumably trusted, session methods.\n- The only potential concern is the `send_progress_notification` sink, which transmits data over the network, but this is standard for progress updates.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a progress tracking utility.\n- **Sinks:** Notes that `send_progress_notification` could send untrusted data, but this is typical.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No anomalies; the code is straightforward.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately concludes no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 (low, given the network call, but standard for progress updates)  \n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2 Analysis**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that progress notifications could leak sensitive info but are standard.\n- Correctly states no suspicious patterns or backdoors.\n- The security risk score is slightly higher at 0.2, which seems justified given the network call.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3 Analysis**\n\n- Emphasizes the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Highlights that no untrusted data is manipulated maliciously.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1  \n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4 Analysis**\n\n- Similar findings; confirms standard progress update pattern.\n- No malicious behaviors detected.\n- Security risk remains low.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2  \n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5 Analysis**\n\n- Reiterates that the code is legitimate for progress reporting.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- The network call is a normal part of progress updates.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are justified due to the network interaction, which is typical for progress notifications but could be considered slightly sensitive.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and uses standard libraries.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, standard progress notification mechanism.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a progress notification system within an asynchronous session framework. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behaviors are evident.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Keep the risk score at around 0.1–0.2, considering the network call.\n- No adjustments needed to the malware or obfuscated scores.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain component is safe and well-implemented, with no security concerns beyond typical progress reporting mechanisms.",
