{
  "purpose": "This code provides a progress tracking mechanism within a request context, enabling the sending of progress notifications during long-running operations.",
  "sources": "Reads from ctx.meta.progressToken, ctx.session, and input parameters like total and amount.",
  "sinks": "Calls to self.session.send_progress_notification, which could potentially send untrusted data or trigger unintended side effects.",
  "flows": "ProgressContext.progress() updates current progress and calls send_progress_notification with the current state, originating from the context's progress token and session.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The code uses standard patterns and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a standard progress notification pattern using async methods and context managers. The only data read is from provided context attributes, and the only sink is a method call to send progress updates. No untrusted data is manipulated in a dangerous manner, and there are no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The logic is straightforward, with proper checks for progress token presence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of progress reporting within a request context. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It relies on external session and context objects, but nothing suspicious is evident in this code segment.",
