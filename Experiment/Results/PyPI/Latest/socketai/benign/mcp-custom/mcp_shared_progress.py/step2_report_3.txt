  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements a progress tracking context manager (`progress`) and a data class (`ProgressContext`) for asynchronous progress updates.\n- Uses session objects to send progress notifications via `send_progress_notification`.\n- Reads progress tokens from `ctx.meta.progressToken`.\n- Performs standard checks for token presence.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code structures are evident.\n- The code appears to be a typical utility for progress reporting in an asynchronous request handling environment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and performs standard progress reporting tasks. No malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious code are apparent.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning?**  \n  The reports are consistent; they correctly identify that the code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The only minor critique is that the `try`/`finally` block in the context manager is empty, which is redundant but not harmful.\n\n- **Scores assigned by reports:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, security risks around 0.1–0.2, and obfuscated scores of 0. They seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):**  \n  None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a high risk score. The code only calls an external session method to send progress updates, which is standard.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports correctly assign malware as 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge that the code is standard and benign.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis: low risk, no malware, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (very low, standard progress reporting utility)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation of progress tracking within an asynchronous session-based framework. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n- No changes needed in the scores or conclusions based on the provided analysis.\n- The code does not pose any security threat or supply chain risk.\n\n**Final estimates:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1             |\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's behavior.",
