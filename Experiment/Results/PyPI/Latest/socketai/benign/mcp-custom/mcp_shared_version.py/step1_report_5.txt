  "purpose": "Define supported protocol versions using a hardcoded integer and a dynamically imported version string.",
  "sources": "The import statement from mcp.types and the LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION variable.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports a version value and assigns a tuple containing a hardcoded integer and the imported version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a constant from a module and defines a tuple containing a fixed integer and this imported value. No external input, no untrusted data handling, nor any suspicious code patterns are present. The usage appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple declaration of supported protocol versions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
