  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the details step-by-step.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: importing `LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION` from `mcp.types` and assigning a tuple `SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS`.\n- No reports mention any dynamic data, user input, network activity, or other suspicious behavior.\n- The code is straightforward, serving as a configuration or version support declaration.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  The code matches the description; no issues or vulnerabilities are evident. The imported constant is used directly in a static assignment.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**  \n  No logical errors or flaws are apparent. The code is simple and standard.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n  - Security risk scores are minimal, which is reasonable.\n  - The reports' scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, and given the code's simplicity, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n- **Malware considerations:**  \n  No signs of malicious activity. The code only imports and assigns constants.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  All claims are cautious and based on the code's straightforwardness.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's benign and static nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a simple configuration snippet with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- There are no indications of obfuscation, malware, or security risks beyond trivial levels.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The scoring reflects this well.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward configuration snippet importing a version constant and defining supported versions. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
