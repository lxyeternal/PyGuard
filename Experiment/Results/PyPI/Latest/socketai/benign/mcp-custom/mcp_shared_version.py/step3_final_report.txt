  "purpose": "Define supported protocol versions by importing the latest version and including it in a supported versions tuple.",
  "sources": "Import of LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION from mcp.types",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks; static assignment only",
  "flows": "Import of version constant → assignment to SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version constant from an external module and assigns a tuple containing an integer and the imported version. It involves no dynamic input, network activity, or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The import relies on an external dependency, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious. The code's purpose appears to be configuration, with no potential for malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static configuration snippet for supported protocol versions. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
