  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, importing a constant `LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION` from an external module and defining a tuple `SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS`.\n- No dynamic user input, network activity, or data processing is involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.\n- The purpose appears to be configuration or version support declaration.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation:**\n- All reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- Obfuscation scores are also 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n\n**Security Risks:**\n- The reported `securityRisk` scores are either 0 or very low (0.1). Given the code's simplicity, this is reasonable.\n- The only slight concern might be the reliance on an external module for `LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only point worth noting is the reliance on an external module. If that module is compromised, it could affect the version value. However, this is a common dependency management concern, not a specific security flaw in this snippet.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate.\n- No changes needed based on the analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The minimal `securityRisk` score of 0.1 in some reports might be slightly overcautious but acceptable given the external dependency aspect.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, due to dependency reliance but not a direct security issue)\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is safe and intended solely for configuration purposes.",
