  "purpose": "Define supported protocol versions using a constant and a imported value",
  "sources": "Import statement: from mcp.types import LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output points",
  "flows": "Import provides the value used in the tuple definition",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present",
  "analysis": "The code imports a constant 'LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION' from a module and defines a tuple 'SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS' including a static integer and the imported value. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It appears to be a simple configuration setting or version support list.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a configuration declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
