  "purpose": "Define supported protocol versions using a constant and a dynamically imported value.",
  "sources": "Import statement from mcp.types, access to LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data output, network, or sensitive operations",
  "flows": "Import from external module -> assignment to SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports a constant LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION from a module and assigns a tuple containing an integer and this imported version to SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS. The import appears standard, and the assignment is straightforward. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as hidden network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's purpose seems to be configuration or compatibility support, with no indications of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and appears to serve a configuration purpose without any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no security risks detected based on this snippet.",
