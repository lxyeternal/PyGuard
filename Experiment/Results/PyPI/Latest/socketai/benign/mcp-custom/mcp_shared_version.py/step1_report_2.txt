  "purpose": "Define supported protocol versions using a constant and a value imported from a module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from mcp.types, usage of LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION in tuple assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output identified; only constant and import usage.",
  "flows": "Import fetches LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION; tuple assignment creates SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS using constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; straightforward version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a constant and assigns it to a tuple with an integer. There are no dynamic inputs, no network activity, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to set supported protocol versions in a standard way. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It relies on an external module for the version value, which is typical and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard version assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and purposeful, defining supported protocol versions.",
