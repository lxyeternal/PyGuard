{
  "purpose": "Define supported protocol versions, including the latest protocol version imported from an external module.",
  "sources": "Import statement for LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION from mcp.types",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; variable assignment is straightforward",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is simple and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports a constant LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION from a module and assigns a tuple containing a hardcoded integer and the imported version to SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS. There are no dynamic or user inputs, no suspicious code constructs, and no indication of malicious behavior or data leaks. The code appears to serve a configuration or compatibility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign configuration snippet that defines supported protocol versions. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
