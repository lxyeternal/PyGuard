  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the original code.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The original code is a straightforward assignment: importing `LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION` from `mcp.types` and defining `SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS` as a tuple with an integer and the imported version.\n- There are no signs of dynamic data, user input, network activity, or code obfuscation.\n- The code appears benign, serving as a configuration or version support list.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic**\n\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n- They correctly note that the code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain suspicious constructs.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- `securityRisk` scores are mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1—this seems to be a conservative estimate, possibly considering minimal external dependency risks.\n- The `obfuscated` scores are 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- No report assigns a risk score above 0.1, which is appropriate.\n- The minimal `securityRisk` score of 0.1 in one report could reflect a generic concern about external dependencies, but given the simplicity, this is probably overly cautious.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware scores**\n\n- All reports correctly assign `malware` as 0, consistent with the code analysis.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond that.\n- No claims of potential vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (or at most 0.1, considering external dependency risks, but given the simplicity, 0 is more appropriate)\n\n---\n\n### **Overall recommendation:**\n\n- The code is a benign configuration snippet.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects the code's straightforward, safe nature.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a simple, safe configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are justified and consistent.",
