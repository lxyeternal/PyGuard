{
  "purpose": "Creates in-memory bidirectional streams for client-server communication, primarily for testing or internal simulation within the MCP framework.",
  "sources": "Memory object streams created via anyio.create_memory_object_stream, used for data exchange between client and server within async context managers.",
  "sinks": "Streams where data (JSONRPCMessage or Exception) is written or read; internal in-memory buffers, no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from created streams between client and server, passing through read and write streams managed within async context managers and task groups.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity; standard async patterns and in-memory data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up in-memory communication channels for testing MCP client-server interactions using standard async context managers and task groups. It does not handle external inputs, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated code. The streams are used solely for internal message passing, with proper cleanup and error handling. No malicious or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured in-memory test harness for MCP client-server communication. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The reported scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
