{
  "purpose": "This code creates in-memory communication channels and manages client-server sessions for testing or simulation purposes within an MCP framework.",
  "sources": "Reads from in-memory streams created by anyio.create_memory_object_stream; receives configuration and callback parameters; reads from the server run method.",
  "sinks": "Writes to in-memory streams; potentially writes to the server run method; any output generated by client or server during their operation.",
  "flows": "Client or server reads data from their respective receive streams, potentially processes it, and may send responses via send streams. The server runs within a task group, and the client session is initialized and maintained through async context managers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code employs in-memory streams without external network communication, reducing risk. No obfuscated code, malicious network calls, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up in-memory transport streams for client-server communication, then runs a server within a task group, and establishes a client session. All operations occur within controlled in-memory buffers, with no external data transmission or system modification. No indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious callbacks, are present. The structure appears to be intended for testing or simulation purposes. The code utilizes standard async context management and library functions, with no unusual or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is designed for in-memory communication testing between a client and server within the MCP framework. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The logic appears secure and benign, serving purely for testing or simulation.",
