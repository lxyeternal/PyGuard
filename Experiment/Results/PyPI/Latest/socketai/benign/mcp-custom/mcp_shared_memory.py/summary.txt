  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured in-memory test harness for MCP client-server communication. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The reported scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose."
