{
  "purpose": "Establishes in-memory communication channels and manages client-server sessions for MCP protocol testing or simulation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external untrusted input; it primarily creates in-memory streams and initializes server and client sessions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data leading to data leaks or security effects; the code mainly sets up communication channels.",
  "flows": "The code flows from stream creation to server run invocation, then to client session initialization, with no external untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of in-memory streams is standard for testing or simulation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code creates memory-based communication streams between client and server, then starts a server task within a task group, and initializes a client session. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. No suspicious or malicious operations are evident, such as network exfiltration, data theft, or backdoors. The design appears to facilitate testing or simulation in a controlled environment without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for in-memory client-server communication setup, likely for testing or simulation purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks.",
