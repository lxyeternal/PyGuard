{
  "purpose": "Static data models defining the MCP protocol messages, requests, responses, and notifications using Pydantic schemas.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data for protocol messages, primarily through model fields and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows that could lead to data leaks or code execution; models are purely structural.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs into model instances; no dynamic or runtime code execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; models are straightforward, with 'extra=allow' for extensibility but no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of Pydantic models representing protocol messages for MCP, including requests, responses, notifications, and error handling. It contains no executable logic, external calls, or embedded code. The use of 'extra=allow' permits additional fields but does not introduce security risks by itself. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors. The models serve as data schemas for communication, with no active or dynamic components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, schema-only implementation of protocol messaging with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1) due to schema flexibility. It is safe for supply chain use.",
