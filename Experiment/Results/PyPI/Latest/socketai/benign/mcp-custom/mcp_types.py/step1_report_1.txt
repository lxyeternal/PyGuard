{
  "purpose": "The code defines data models for a JSON-RPC-based protocol used for communication between clients and servers in a Model Context Protocol (MCP) system. It provides structures for requests, responses, notifications, and capabilities related to resource management, prompts, tools, logging, and other functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from incoming JSON requests and notifications, and from configuration and protocol constants. It also references external URLs and URIs for resources.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could flow into the models through parameters such as 'meta', 'annotations', 'arguments', 'content', and 'data' fields, which could be exploited if improperly validated or used without sanitization. However, the code itself does not perform any operations beyond data modeling and serialization.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external JSON inputs into model instances, which can then be used internally or serialized for responses or further processing. No explicit or dynamic execution based on these data structures is present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or unusual code behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is predominantly data structure definitions. There are no obfuscated code segments, dynamic execution, or suspicious imports beyond standard type hints and data validation libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a schema definition for a communication protocol, using Pydantic models to enforce data validation and structure. All models include 'extra=allow' to permit additional fields, which could be a minor concern if not properly handled downstream, but does not pose an immediate security risk. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network calls, file manipulations, or code execution within this module. The code is static, well-structured, and intended for data validation and serialization. External URL references are benign, and no hardcoded credentials or secrets are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive set of data models for a protocol, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions as a protocol schema and does not perform any operations that could be exploited. The overall security risk is minimal, assuming proper handling of data at runtime.",
