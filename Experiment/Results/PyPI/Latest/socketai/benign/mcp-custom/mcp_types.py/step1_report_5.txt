{
  "purpose": "This code defines data models and protocol bindings for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) using Pydantic, facilitating communication between clients and servers in a structured, typed manner.",
  "sources": "Data inputs originate from external API requests, responses, and notifications, especially through JSON-RPC messages, and include user-provided or server-generated data such as resources, prompts, models, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially be processed or stored in the models, but there are no evident sink points where untrusted data leads to actions like executing code, writing to system files, or network communication within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs (e.g., JSON payloads) into Pydantic models for validation, then possibly into other components or systems outside this code. No direct execution or system calls are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive type definitions, data models, and protocol logic without any suspicious or unusual patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are observed. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network activity embedded.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily comprises structured data models for JSON-RPC communication and protocol capabilities, with no executable logic or system interaction. All models allow extra fields for extensibility, but this is standard protocol flexibility. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The code is well-structured, consistent, and focused on data validation and serialization.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a safe, standard implementation of protocol data models for MCP, with no malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks identified. It does not perform any operations beyond data validation and protocol structuring.",
