{
  "purpose": "Define data models and protocol message structures for a Python implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), including request, response, and notification schemas.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments, class definitions, and model field declarations across the entire codebase, especially where data is read or stored such as 'LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION', class attributes, and fields.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code primarily contains data structure definitions without any data processing or external I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data to model instances and validation logic, but there are no external data flows or untrusted data processing in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or unusual behavior detected. The code strictly defines data schemas without runtime or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions using Pydantic for data validation and serialization, modeling protocol messages for MCP. There are no external data inputs, no execution of code, no network operations, nor any embedded code that could perform malicious actions. It uses constants, type aliases, and data models to specify the structure of requests, responses, notifications, and server/client capabilities. All code appears to be purely structural, with no dynamic or executable code that could be malicious. The absence of functions executing commands, file access, network calls, or secret handling suggests there is no malicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of data models for protocol communication in MCP. It is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a schema definition and contains no runtime logic or external interactions that could be exploited.",
