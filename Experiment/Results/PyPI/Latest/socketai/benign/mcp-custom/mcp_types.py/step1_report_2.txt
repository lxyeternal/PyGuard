{
  "purpose": "Define data models and message protocols for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) using Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and third-party libraries (collections.abc, typing, pydantic). Constant string definitions, class attributes, and model fields, including URI handling, metadata, and notification parameters.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data sinks like network calls, file writes, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs via API requests/notifications into data models; no active data processing or malicious code execution evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of 'Any' types and flexible models could be abused for code injection if misused outside this context, but within this code, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of Pydantic model definitions for protocol messaging, including request, response, notification, and error handling models. No executable logic, code injection, or system manipulation code is present. The models facilitate structured communication between clients and servers in the MCP ecosystem. The use of extra='allow' in configs allows flexible extensions but does not introduce malicious behavior. The presence of URI handling, metadata, and notification mechanisms appears standard and aligned with protocol design. No suspicious functions, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a schema and protocol definition for MCP communication, with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful functionality. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of message models for protocol operations. No malware or security risks are detected based on this code alone.",
