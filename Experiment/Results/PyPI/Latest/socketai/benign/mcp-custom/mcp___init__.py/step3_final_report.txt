{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports various internal components and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure, with no runtime logic or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports from relative paths within the package.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static import statements and export list; no data flow or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initialization or API module, importing internal components and defining __all__ for exports. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, external inputs, or dynamic code execution. All signals indicate a benign, static structure typical for Python modules. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its static, import/export nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
