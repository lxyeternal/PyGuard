{
  "purpose": "The code defines imports and exports for a Python package related to client-server communication, including session management, standard I/O, exceptions, types, and capabilities for a messaging or RPC framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules such as .client.session, .client.stdio, .server.session, .server.stdio, .shared.exceptions, and .types",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident; no untrusted data handling, external calls, or execution of code based on external inputs are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily establishes import/export mappings, without runtime data flows, data processing, or external input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import/export module with no suspicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic execution. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The module consists solely of import statements from internal components and an explicit list (__all__) defining the package's public API. There are no functions, data processing, external data sources, or runtime logic that could indicate malicious activity. All components appear to be standard, organized package elements related to a client-server messaging framework. The absence of any code execution, network operations, or data handling suggests no malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import/export module for a Python package, with no suspicious or malicious content detected. It serves as a public interface for other modules to use the defined classes and functions.",
