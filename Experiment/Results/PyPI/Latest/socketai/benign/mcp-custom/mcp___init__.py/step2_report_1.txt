  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze their assessments, scores, and underlying logic.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely an import/export module with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Standard import module, no external input.\n- **Sinks & flows:** None; purely static.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious behavior, straightforward module setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that it's a straightforward import/export module with no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- Similar observations; focuses on the package's API structure.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- Reiterates that the code is purely for organizing module exports with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- Also confirms no dynamic or malicious behavior, just module organization.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no indication of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, static import/export structure.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, reflecting no security concerns.\n\n**However,** given the nature of this code—being purely import/export statements—it is unlikely to warrant any higher scores unless there are hidden issues. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-justified. The scores are appropriate, and the overall assessment aligns with the code's simplicity and transparency.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Since this code is purely structural, there is no need to assign any risk or malware scores above zero. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the analysis and consensus.",
