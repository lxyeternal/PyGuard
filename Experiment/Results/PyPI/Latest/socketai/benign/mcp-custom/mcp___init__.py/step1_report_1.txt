{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an import module for a larger Python project, defining exports and importing various components related to client-server communication, exceptions, and data types.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from internal module imports, primarily reading static definitions, class imports, and type declarations. No external input reading or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; there are no data writes, network operations, or execution of untrusted data. The code mainly establishes imports and exports.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is purely import/export statements without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual logic, are present. The code structure is straightforward, importing modules and defining exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module file, importing classes, functions, and constants from other internal modules and re-exporting them via __all__. It contains no executable logic, no input handling, and no data processing. Since it is solely used for module structure, it does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The absence of runtime logic, network activity, or dynamic code execution indicates low risk.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard import/export configuration file with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It simply organizes and exposes components of a larger package. Therefore, the code poses no security threat.",
