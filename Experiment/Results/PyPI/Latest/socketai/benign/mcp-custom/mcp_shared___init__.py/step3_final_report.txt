{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be involved in data processing, possibly reading environment variables and performing string manipulations, with no clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input streams, external modules",
  "sinks": "Potential network or file output operations, but no explicit sinks identified",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs through processing functions to outputs or external modules",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code appears straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code shows standard Python constructs with minimal dynamic evaluation or string manipulation. No signs of malicious behavior such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The limited code context prevents definitive conclusions, but no indicators of malicious activity are present. Confidence is high (0.75), malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0.2, reflecting low concern with acknowledgment of limited information.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the observed benign characteristics. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
