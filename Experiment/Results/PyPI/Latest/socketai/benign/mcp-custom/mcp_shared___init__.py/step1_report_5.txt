  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided due to the absence of code content; therefore, the intent cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from standard input, environment variables, and possibly network connections (if present). Specific source locations cannot be identified without code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets, file system writes, subprocess calls, or data exfiltration points, but none are explicitly observed due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "Without concrete code, no source-to-sink data flows can be established or analyzed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are observed. The code appears minimal or absent, limiting analysis.",
  "analysis": "The review was conducted step-by-step, but no code content was provided. Therefore, no specific sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies could be identified. The lack of code prevents detailed analysis.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there are no detectable malicious behaviors or security risks. The package appears benign, but without code, this conclusion is provisional.",
