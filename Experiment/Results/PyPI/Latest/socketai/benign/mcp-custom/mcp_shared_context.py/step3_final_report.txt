  "purpose": "Defines a generic data class 'RequestContext' to encapsulate request-related data such as request ID, optional metadata, session, and lifespan context for request handling.",
  "sources": "RequestId, RequestParams.Meta, session object, lifespan_context parameter",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output or external communication",
  "flows": "Data flows from the fields when used in application logic; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured Python data class utilizing generics and type annotations to encapsulate request context data. It imports standard and custom modules, with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling from untrusted sources. The code serves purely as a data container, with no malicious or security-sensitive operations. All signals indicate benign, standard code with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard request context data structure with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
