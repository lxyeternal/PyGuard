{
  "purpose": "Defines a generic data class 'RequestContext' to encapsulate request-related information including request ID, metadata, session, and lifespan context.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dataclasses', 'typing', 'typing_extensions', and local modules 'mcp.shared.session' and 'mcp.types'. No external input sources within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; code primarily defines data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only establishes a container class.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected. Use of type variables and generic typing is standard for flexible data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines type variables with bounds. It creates a dataclass with generic parameters, incorporating potentially dynamic session types and lifespan context. No code execution, data processing, or external interactions are present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are identified. The code appears to be a standard data structure definition for a request handling framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a type-safe, flexible container for request information. It does not contain any malicious, maliciously obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. It is a typical pattern in well-structured Python projects for managing request context.",
