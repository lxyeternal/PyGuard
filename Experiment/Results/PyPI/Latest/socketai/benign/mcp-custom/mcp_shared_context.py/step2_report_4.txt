  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the underlying code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a generic `RequestContext` data class with fields:\n  - `request_id` (RequestId)\n  - `meta` (optional RequestParams.Meta)\n  - `session` (generic SessionT, bound to BaseSession)\n  - `lifespan_context` (generic LifespanContextT)\n- Uses standard libraries (`dataclasses`, `typing`) and local modules (`mcp.shared.session`, `mcp.types`)\n- No data processing, network, or external input/output occurs in this snippet.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent.\n- **Data flow:** No untrusted data flows to sinks; purely structural.\n\n### Critical review of the reports:\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- They correctly identify that the code is mainly defining a data structure with no external data handling or malicious constructs.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very close to it, which is justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or security vulnerability.\n- The code is purely structural, intended for request context management.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports do not assume any external data or untrusted sources being processed within this snippet, which is correct.\n- No dynamic code execution or secret handling is present.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured data class for request context management. It does not contain any malicious logic, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of generics and type annotations is typical for flexible API design, and no external or untrusted data handling is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately assess the code as benign. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
