  "purpose": "Define a generic RequestContext data structure for handling request metadata, session, and lifespan context.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses, typing, and mcp.shared.session and mcp.types modules",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks; no untrusted data processing or output present",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input to sensitive operations or external outputs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs; standard use of generics and dataclasses",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines a generic dataclass for request context management, referencing external modules for session and request types. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. It is a straightforward implementation of data structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard implementation of a request context container with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
