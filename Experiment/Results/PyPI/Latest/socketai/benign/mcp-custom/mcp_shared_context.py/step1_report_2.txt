  "purpose": "Define a generic data structure for request context including request ID, metadata, session, and lifespan context.",
  "sources": "Import statements for dataclasses, typing, and custom modules (mcp.shared.session, mcp.types). Variable annotations within the class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations identified; code mainly defines data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; just type annotations and class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. Usage of type variables is standard for generic programming.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic data class 'RequestContext' that encapsulates request-specific information, including a request ID, optional metadata, a session object, and a lifespan context. The imports are standard, and the class structure appears typical for a request handling framework. No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security risks are evident. No external inputs, outputs, or data flows suggest any malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard definition of a request context data structure with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It appears safe and intended for organizing request-related data within a larger application framework.",
