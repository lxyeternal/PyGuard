  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a simple, well-structured data class with type variables, used to encapsulate request context data.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- No external data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly defines a generic `RequestContext` with appropriate fields and type annotations.\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** The minimal risk score (0 or 0.1) is appropriate, given the code's static, structural nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n1. **Logical correctness:** The code correctly uses `dataclass`, `Generic`, and `TypeVar` to define a flexible, type-safe request context container.\n2. **Potential vulnerabilities:** None are apparent. The code does not handle untrusted data directly, nor does it perform any operations that could be exploited.\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - Malware score: consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated: 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n   - Security risk: 0 or very close, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned (all zero or near-zero) are reasonable and justified.\n- The analysis and conclusions in all reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Aspect            | Score  | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0       | No malicious code, behavior, or suspicious patterns present. |\n| Obfuscated        | 0       | Clear, straightforward code without obfuscation.             |\n| Security risk     | 0.1     | Minimal, as the code is purely structural with no data handling. |\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is a benign, standard data structure definition for request context management. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or scoring adjustments are needed.",
