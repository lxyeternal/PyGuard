{
  "purpose": "Define a generic data structure for request context management, including request ID, metadata, session, and lifespan context.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library and local modules (dataclasses, typing, typing_extensions, mcp.shared.session, mcp.types). No user input or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data leakage could occur. No output, network, or file operations.",
  "flows": "The code establishes a data structure with fields for request handling; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs identified. The code primarily defines types and a data class.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and local modules, defines type variables for generics constrained to existing classes, and creates a @dataclass with type annotations. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling present. The code appears purely structural, intended for request context encapsulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of a generic request context data structure with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard for request management systems.",
