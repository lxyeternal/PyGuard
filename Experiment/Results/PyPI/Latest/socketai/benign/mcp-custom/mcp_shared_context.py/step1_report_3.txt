  "purpose": "Define a generic data structure for holding request context information, including request ID, optional metadata, session, and lifespan context.",
  "sources": "Import statements for dataclass, typing, and custom modules; class and variable definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data processing observed; no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class instantiation to attribute access, but no untrusted input or external data handling within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party typing modules and defines a dataclass with generics for flexible typing of request-related information. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, external data handling, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured type definition intended for use in a larger application. The usage of type variables and type hints aligns with best practices, and no unusual patterns or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard type definition for request context data in a Python application. It does not contain malware, security risks, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal, and there are no indications of malicious intent.",
