  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple module initialization that imports from a local 'tsql' module, sets version info, and defines exports.\n- The comments mention package renaming for PyPI compatibility, which is benign.\n- No external data, user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The code is minimal and standard for a Python package's __init__.py.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious activity or security issues.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in reasoning:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors?**  \n  No. All reports correctly interpret the code as a benign package setup script.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Confidence:**  \n  All reports assign a confidence of 1.0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All assign 0, which aligns with the analysis that no malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Should any scores be adjusted?\n- No. The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Justification for malware and risk scores:\n- Since there's no malicious behavior, malware score remains 0.\n- Security risk is also 0, as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a straightforward package initialization module with no security concerns. The comments about package renaming are benign and do not indicate malicious intent. The reports are accurate in their benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are correct. The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scoring reflects this appropriately.",
