  "purpose": "To expose and re-export components ('sql' and 'SQLTemplate') from the 'tsql' module, and to specify package version information.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs imports and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. The comment about package renaming is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing specific modules and setting metadata. It includes a comment explaining a package renaming for compatibility but does not perform any dynamic or malicious operations. There are no inputs, data processing, or network interactions. The code structure is straightforward and standard for a Python package __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package initialization file with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
