  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization script that imports specific components from a local 'tsql' module, sets version information, and defines exportable symbols. It includes a comment about package renaming for distribution compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.tsql' module, comment about package renaming",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, user input, or network activity",
  "flows": "Import from local module; no data flow involving untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Comment about package renaming for PyPI compatibility; no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python module setup file with no input/output, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. The comments are benign and related to distribution practices. All indicators point to benign, straightforward code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and justified based on the code content.",
