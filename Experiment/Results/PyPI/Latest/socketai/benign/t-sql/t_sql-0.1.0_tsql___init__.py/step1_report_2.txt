  "purpose": "Define package version and export sql and SQLTemplate from a local module, likely related to SQL handling.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .tsql module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or sensitive operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only imports and sets metadata",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious constructs; comments clarify renaming for PyPI compatibility",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes/functions from a local module, sets version information, and specifies exports. No user input, network operations, or sensitive data handling is present. The comment indicates package renaming for distribution, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
