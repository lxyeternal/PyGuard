{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to define and export components ('sql' and 'SQLTemplate') from the 'tsql' package module for use in other parts of the project or by external users.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module attributes (__version__, __all__) and imports from the local '.tsql' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external or untrusted inputs; the code only defines metadata and imports internal components.",
  "anomalies": "The comment mentions renaming for PyPI compatibility and maintains an import name for simplicity, but there are no suspicious or unusual behaviors or code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of import statements and module metadata. It imports 'sql' and 'SQLTemplate' from a local module, and sets package version info. No input handling, no data processing, no external communications, or complex logic is present. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The comment about renaming indicates an awareness of packaging concerns but does not introduce suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization snippet with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It primarily manages imports and metadata for the package. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
