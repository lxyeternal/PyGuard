{
  "purpose": "Define module exports and versioning for a package related to T-SQL functionalities.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; the code imports from a local module '.tsql'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output points; no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only performs module setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code mentions a package renamed for PyPI compatibility but maintains an import alias, which is benign; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing specific components from a local module, setting version and export variables, and commenting on package renaming for distribution. No input/output handling, network activity, or data processing is present. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward package setup code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages module exports and versioning, with a benign comment about package renaming.",
