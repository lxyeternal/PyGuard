{
  "purpose": "To test SQL string formatting functionality using the tsql library's sql function in unit tests.",
  "sources": "Input data from format parameters within the test cases (user_id, table, column, value).",
  "sinks": "The formatted SQL query string, which could be executed or logged elsewhere (not shown in this code).",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., user_id, table, column, value) are injected into the SQL query via string formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments. Usage of format in SQL query is standard but could lead to SQL injection if untrusted input is used in real scenarios.",
  "analysis": "The code defines unit tests that construct SQL queries using the tsql library's sql function. The queries are formatted with parameters, which are safe within the context of test inputs but could pose risks if untrusted data is used in real applications. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are apparent. The tests assume correct formatting and do not execute the SQL, avoiding direct data leakage or command injection in this context. The code itself is straightforward and standard for testing SQL string formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard unit tests for the tsql library's formatting functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. However, in a real-world scenario, formatting SQL queries with untrusted input can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities, but this code uses controlled test data. Overall, no malicious activity is detected.",
