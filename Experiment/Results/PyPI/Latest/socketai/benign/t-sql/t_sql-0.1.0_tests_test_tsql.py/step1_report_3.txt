  "purpose": "Unit testing for SQL query formatting using the 'tsql' library to ensure proper string interpolation.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters such as 'user_id', 'table', 'column', and 'value'.",
  "sinks": "The formatted SQL query string, which could be vulnerable if user input is not sanitized, leading to SQL injection.",
  "flows": "User inputs ('user_id', 'table', 'column', 'value') flow into the 'format' method of the query object, producing a SQL string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. Usage of 'tsql' for templated SQL is legitimate but can be risky if inputs are untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple unit tests on the 'tsql' library's formatting function. The 'tsql' library is used to embed parameters into SQL strings, which is normal for parameterized queries. However, the code itself does not sanitize or validate inputs before formatting, which can lead to SQL injection if untrusted data is used. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The tests only demonstrate string substitution functionality. The code structure is straightforward and lacks any suspicious or anomalous patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard unit testing for SQL string formatting. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The primary security concern is potential SQL injection if untrusted inputs are used without proper sanitization, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet.",
