  "purpose": "Unit tests for the tsql library's SQL string formatting functionality",
  "sources": "Reading from the 'sql' function call and the string literals used as SQL queries",
  "sinks": "The use of the 'format' method on SQL query objects to inject parameters",
  "flows": "Input parameters (user_id, table, column, value) flow into formatted SQL queries via the format method",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting for SQL queries, which could lead to SQL injection if used with untrusted input. No evidence of hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The test code itself is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines unit tests for a library called 'tsql', focusing on SQL string formatting. It uses a custom 'sql' function to generate query objects, which are then formatted with specific parameters. The format method replaces placeholders with provided values. While the code itself appears benign, the pattern of formatting SQL queries with string interpolation can be risky if untrusted input is used in real scenarios, as it may lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or hardcoded secrets. The code's structure is clear, and the test scenarios are simple.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily unit test code for a SQL formatting library. It demonstrates parameter substitution but does not show actual execution or data handling that could be malicious. The use of string formatting for SQL can be dangerous if used improperly in production, but within the context of this test code, no malicious intent or security risk is evident.",
