  "purpose": "Unit testing for SQL string formatting using the tsql library, verifying correct substitution of parameters.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from string literals and formatted parameters provided to the sql() function calls.",
  "sinks": "Formatted SQL query strings, which could potentially be executed in a database context.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (user_id, table, column, value) flow into sql() calls and then into format() method, resulting in formatted SQL strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard unittest structure and parameter substitution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit tests on SQL string formatting functions from the tsql library. It uses input parameters to create SQL queries and verifies the correctness of formatted strings. There is no indication of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The use of parameterized SQL formatting is generally safe if the underlying library handles SQL injection prevention, which appears to be the case here. No suspicious network or system operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test for SQL string formatting and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It demonstrates proper use of parameter substitution in tests without executing or manipulating the database. Overall, the code is safe.",
