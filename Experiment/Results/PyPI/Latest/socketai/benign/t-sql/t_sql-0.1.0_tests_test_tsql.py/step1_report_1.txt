{
  "purpose": "The code defines unit tests for a SQL string formatting library, specifically testing safe formatting of SQL queries with parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded strings used as SQL templates and data passed as parameters to format method.",
  "sinks": "The format method on the SQL query objects; the formatted SQL string is generated for potential execution or inspection.",
  "flows": "Input data (parameters) are inserted into SQL query templates via the format method, producing a final SQL string.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a custom 'sql' function with a string prefix (suggested in comments) indicates potential dynamic string processing, but actual code shows simple format calls. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code tests SQL string formatting functions, which is generally safe provided the format method is implemented securely. The code does not execute the SQL, nor does it show direct execution or data transmission. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network connections, or hidden backdoors. The comments suggest a version requirement for a specific string prefix, but the provided code uses straightforward Python string formatting, not vulnerable to SQL injection in this context. Overall, the code appears to be standard unit tests for a SQL formatting library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for a SQL formatting library, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply tests string formatting functionality.",
