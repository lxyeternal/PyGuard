  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'tsql' library's sql() function, testing string formatting with parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the format() method parameters.",
  "sinks": "The formatted SQL string output, which could be vulnerable if used with untrusted input in production.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the format() method, producing the final SQL string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code; comments mention a 't-string' prefix and Python 3.14+, but the code uses standard string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward unit testing of string formatting for SQL queries, with no execution or network activity. The use of string formatting poses a potential SQL injection risk if untrusted input is used in production, but in this controlled test context, inputs are safe. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assign malware scores of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.2), which are appropriate given the controlled environment. The comments about 't-string' and Python 3.14+ are likely typos or irrelevant to security assessment. Overall, the code is safe, and the risk is minimal in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as unit tests for string formatting. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present. The potential security concern (SQL injection) is acknowledged but not applicable here due to controlled inputs. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
