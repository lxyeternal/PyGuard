  "purpose": "Provides a simple SQL templating utility using Python's str.format(), intended for constructing SQL queries with parameters.",
  "sources": "The 'query_template' string in SQLTemplate, and the 'template' argument in the sql() function.",
  "sinks": "The 'format' method where untrusted input is interpolated directly into SQL query strings.",
  "flows": "Input data passed to the 'format' method flows directly into the SQL query string, potentially leading to SQL injection if untrusted data is used.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not perform validation or sanitization of input; it relies on the user to handle safety, which is risky. No obfuscation or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward SQL templating class that uses Python's str.format() for parameter insertion. It does not include validation or sanitization, making it vulnerable to SQL injection if untrusted input is formatted directly into queries. The code contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The main security concern is misuse, not malicious intent. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious behavior. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward. The security risk score is approximately 0.5 to 0.6, justified by the potential for SQL injection if used improperly, but not intrinsic maliciousness. The existing reports' scores are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for SQL query templating but promotes unsafe practices if untrusted data is formatted directly into SQL strings. It contains no malware or obfuscation. The primary security risk stems from misuse, leading to potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a moderate security risk score around 0.5 to 0.6.",
