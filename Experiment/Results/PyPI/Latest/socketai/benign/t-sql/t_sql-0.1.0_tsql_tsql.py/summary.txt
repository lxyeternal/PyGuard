  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for SQL query templating but promotes unsafe practices if untrusted data is formatted directly into SQL strings. It contains no malware or obfuscation. The primary security risk stems from misuse, leading to potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a moderate security risk score around 0.5 to 0.6."
