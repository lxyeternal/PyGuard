{
  "purpose": "Provide a simple SQL templating utility using Python's string formatting.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'query_template' in SQLTemplate.__init__, the 'template' parameter in the sql() function.",
  "sinks": "The 'format' method of SQLTemplate, which interpolates user-supplied data into SQL queries.",
  "flows": "User-provided data (via format method) flows from function argument into the query string, potentially leading to SQL injection if untrusted data is used.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses string formatting for SQL query construction without any validation or sanitization, which is a common source of SQL injection vulnerabilities. There are no hardcoded credentials or other suspicious patterns. The code comments acknowledge that validation should be performed but currently do not implement it.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class SQLTemplate for constructing SQL queries using Python's format method. The 'sql' function creates instances of this class, passing user-provided template strings. The key concern is that the 'format' method directly interpolates parameters into SQL strings without validation, which can lead to SQL injection if untrusted input is passed. No malicious code or backdoors are present; however, the design itself is insecure if misused. There is no evidence of obfuscation or malware behavior. Overall, the code's structure is straightforward, but its insecure handling of SQL templates poses a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides a utility for SQL query templating but lacks safeguards against SQL injection. It does not contain malicious intent but is insecure if used with untrusted data. The primary concern is the potential for SQL injection due to direct string formatting.",
