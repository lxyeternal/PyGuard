{
  "purpose": "Provide a simple SQL templating mechanism using Python string formatting with support for t-strings.",
  "sources": "The 'sql' function receives a string argument (template), and the 'format' method of SQLTemplate takes keyword arguments for formatting.",
  "sinks": "The 'format' method of SQLTemplate where the formatted SQL query is generated; potential risk if untrusted data is passed here.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data passed to the 'format' method can directly influence the resulting SQL query.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not perform validation or sanitization of the template or the input parameters, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple templating class for SQL strings using Python's str.format method. The 'sql' function creates an SQLTemplate object with a given string, which can be formatted with user-supplied data. There are no explicit input validation or sanitization mechanisms to prevent injection or malicious input. While the code itself does not contain malicious behavior, it facilitates dynamic SQL query generation that can be exploited if used improperly. No signs of obfuscation or malware are present. The design relies on the developer to ensure safe usage, but without safeguards, it poses a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a basic SQL templating system without input validation, making it vulnerable to SQL injection if user input is passed directly into the 'format' method. There is no malicious intent evident, but the potential for security issues exists depending on usage. It is important to sanitize inputs when using this pattern.",
