{
  "purpose": "Define a simple SQL templating class and a factory function for creating SQL templates using f-string-like syntax.",
  "sources": "The input source is the 'template' argument passed to the 'sql' function, which is used to create an SQLTemplate instance.",
  "sinks": "The 'format' method of SQLTemplate outputs a formatted SQL string, which could potentially be used to execute SQL commands.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the 'template' input to the SQLTemplate object, and subsequently, the formatted string produced by 'format' could be used in database operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code lacks validation or sanitization of user inputs used in SQL formatting, which is a common security concern but not malicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a minimal SQL templating mechanism. It allows the creation of SQL queries with parameter substitution. While the code itself does not execute any queries, it facilitates generating SQL statements that could be used elsewhere. There is no evidence of malicious intent; however, the implementation does not include safeguards against SQL injection, which could lead to security issues if misused. The comments acknowledge this lack of validation but do not suggest malicious purpose. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, benign utility with potential security risks if misused, but no malicious activity or sabotage is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward SQL templating utility that lacks validation or sanitization, which could pose security risks if used improperly. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage within this code segment.",
