  "purpose": "Define a simple SQL template class using Python's f-string style for formatting SQL queries.",
  "sources": "The 'sql' function takes a string argument which is intended to be a template for SQL queries.",
  "sinks": "The 'format' method of SQLTemplate calls Python's str.format, which could insert untrusted input into SQL queries if used improperly.",
  "flows": "Input data provided via the 'format' method flows directly into the query string, which may lead to SQL injection if untrusted data is formatted into the template.",
  "anomalies": "The code comments acknowledge that there is no validation or sanitization of the SQL templates. No validation is performed to prevent SQL injection; the code relies solely on the user to avoid dangerous formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a basic mechanism to create SQL query templates using string formatting. It defines a class for templating and a function to instantiate this class. There are no security controls, validation, or sanitization mechanisms in place. The use of str.format for SQL query construction is inherently unsafe if untrusted data is passed without parameterization, making the approach vulnerable to SQL injection. The code does not include any malicious logic; it simply facilitates a pattern that can be dangerous if misused. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious intent, but it promotes unsafe SQL query construction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple SQL templating utility that, if misused, can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. It does not contain malicious behavior itself but encourages unsafe practices by formatting SQL queries directly with untrusted input.",
