{
  "purpose": "Define a simple SQL templating system using Python's string formatting.",
  "sources": "The 'sql' function accepts a string argument (template) and the 'format' method on SQLTemplate uses keyword arguments for formatting.",
  "sinks": "The 'format' method directly inserts untrusted input into an SQL query string without validation or sanitization.",
  "flows": "Input (template string and formatting parameters) flows from 'sql' and 'format' into the SQL query string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious external calls or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward SQL templating class that allows formatting SQL queries with user-provided parameters. The 'format' method inserts these parameters directly into the query string, which could lead to SQL injection if used improperly. The 'sql' function creates an instance of this class without validation or sanitization. There are no malicious behaviors, such as network activity, file modification, or backdoors. The code relies on the user to securely handle the formatted queries. It does not perform any dangerous operations or contain hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a basic SQL templating mechanism that, if misused, can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities but does not itself contain malicious intent or malware. It is a straightforward utility without obfuscated or malicious code.",
