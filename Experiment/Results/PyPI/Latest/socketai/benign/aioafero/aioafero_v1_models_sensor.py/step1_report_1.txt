{
  "purpose": "Define data classes for sensors and sensor errors, with properties for accessing values.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and constants, no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no output, external data transmission, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code purely defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code present. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data classes for sensors, including properties for sensor values and error states. It includes predefined sensor lists. There are no input/output functions, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The use of property decorators is standard and safe. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data structure definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and focused solely on modeling sensor data.",
