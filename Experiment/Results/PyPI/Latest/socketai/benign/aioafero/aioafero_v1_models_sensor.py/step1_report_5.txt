  "purpose": "Define data structures for sensors and sensor errors, storing sensor information and status.",
  "sources": "Class initializers (__init__), property methods, and default field values.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks or external data processing points; code primarily defines data classes.",
  "flows": "Assignment to class attributes during object creation and property setter usage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution. Usage of property setters and getters is standard. No external data or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes: AferoSensor and AferoSensorError, with straightforward attributes and properties. No external input handling, network calls, or file operations are present. The property methods are simple and used for encapsulation. No malicious logic, backdoors, or security risks identified. No signs of obfuscation or malware behavior. Overall, the code appears to be standard, harmless data structure definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of sensor data classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves as a data model without external side effects or security concerns.",
