{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for sensors and sensor errors, likely for a monitoring or IoT application.",
  "sources": "Input data for class instantiation, such as sensor id, owner, and values provided at runtime.",
  "targets": "Potentially untrusted data could be assigned to '_value' attributes, but there are no explicit sinks performing dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input into class attributes (_value), and through the 'value' property setters/getters, but no dangerous processing or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior; the code is straightforward data modeling. The 'value' setter in 'AferoSensorError' allows external code to modify internal state, but this is normal for data classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two dataclasses for sensors and sensor errors, with properties for safe access. No external system calls, network activity, or obfuscated patterns are present. The '_value' attributes are internal, with no malicious code or malicious side effects. The code appears to be standard data structure definitions without any malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data modeling module for sensor data, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is straightforward and safe.",
