  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code only defines data classes and constants related to sensors.\n- No external data input, output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are identified.\n- The code uses standard Python features (dataclasses, properties) safely.\n- The only potential concern is the `value` setter in `AferoSensorError`, but it is a typical pattern for data classes and does not introduce security risks.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious behavior:**\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n   - The code is purely declarative, modeling sensor data.\n\n2. **Obfuscation:**\n   - No obfuscated code or techniques used.\n   - The code is straightforward and readable.\n\n3. **Security risks:**\n   - No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or external data handling.\n   - The `value` setter in `AferoSensorError` allows modification, but this is normal for mutable data classes and not inherently risky.\n\n4. **Scores justification:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Confidence is high (1), given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- The reports are consistent and do not overstate or understate risks.\n- No report suggests any code that could be exploited or is malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign data modeling module.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, straightforward, and does not pose any security threat.",
