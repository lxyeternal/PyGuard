  "purpose": "Define data structures for sensors and sensor errors, including sensor identifiers, owners, values, units, and instances.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading sources; all data is defined through class instantiation or constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only defines data classes with property accessors.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code declares constants for sensor types and defines two data classes with properties and simple getters/setters. It does not perform any I/O, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data modeling module for sensor information, with no malicious or security-compromising elements.",
