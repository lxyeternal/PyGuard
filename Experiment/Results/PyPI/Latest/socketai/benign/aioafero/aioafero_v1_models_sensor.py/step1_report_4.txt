  "purpose": "Define data structures for sensors and sensor errors with attributes and value accessors.",
  "sources": "Constants MAPPED_SENSORS and BINARY_SENSORS; class attribute definitions; property getters and setters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicative of malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code uses standard dataclass features and property methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes, AferoSensor and AferoSensorError, with attributes and property methods for encapsulating sensor data. No dynamic execution, network operations, or security-sensitive operations are present. The constants are simple lists. The property setter and getter are standard; no code injection or obfuscation detected. No malicious intent or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward data model for sensors and errors, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
