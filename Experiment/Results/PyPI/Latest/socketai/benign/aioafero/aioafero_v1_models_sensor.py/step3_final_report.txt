{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for sensor information and error states in a sensor management system.",
  "sources": "Constants 'MAPPED_SENSORS' and 'BINARY_SENSORS'; class attributes '_value' and 'owner'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; data is stored internally without external output.",
  "flows": "Assignment to '_value' and 'owner' attributes; access via property 'value'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; standard property usage and data class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple data classes for sensors and errors, with constants listing sensor types. No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The property setters and getters are standard. The '_value' attribute can be externally set, but this is typical for data models and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic are detected. The code is purely declarative, modeling sensor data without any security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data modeling module with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
