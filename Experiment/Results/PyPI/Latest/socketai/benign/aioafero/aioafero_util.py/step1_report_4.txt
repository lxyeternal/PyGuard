  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between ordered list items and percentages, and processing range values",
  "sources": "Function parameters: ordered_list, item, range_vals",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data leakage or untrusted data processing is performed",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed locally; no external data sources or sinks involved",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Functions operate solely on provided data without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code implements basic list indexing and range processing logic with standard Python functions. It includes safeguards for empty lists and missing items. No use of environment variables, network operations, or insecure coding practices is evident. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are present. The logic is straightforward and self-contained.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for handling ordered lists and ranges. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified. It is purely computational with no external communication or sensitive data handling.",
