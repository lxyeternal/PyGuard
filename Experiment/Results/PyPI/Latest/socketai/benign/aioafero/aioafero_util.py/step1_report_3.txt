  "purpose": "Utility functions for mapping between percentage values and ordered list items, and processing numeric ranges.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: ordered_list, percentage, item, and range_vals. The range_vals parameter is expected to be a dictionary containing range specifications.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The functions perform data processing without external I/O or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed locally; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The range processing logic appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for converting between percentage and list items and processing numeric ranges. No external input sources or outputs are present, and the logic involves standard list and range operations. The functions include validation and boundary checks but do not execute code from untrusted sources or perform insecure operations. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It provides data transformation utilities with proper validation and error handling. Overall, the code is safe and not suspicious.",
