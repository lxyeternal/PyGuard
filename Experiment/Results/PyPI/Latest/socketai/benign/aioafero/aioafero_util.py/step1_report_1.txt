{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling ordered lists and ranges, likely for configuration or control settings such as fan speeds.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'ordered_list', 'percentage', 'item', and 'range_vals'. These are data inputs provided to the functions, with 'percentage' and 'item' being user-provided or external data, and 'range_vals' being a configuration object.",
  "sinks": "The functions return values based on input data; no external sinks such as network or file operations are present. No data is transmitted or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed within functions to produce corresponding outputs: 'percentage_to_ordered_list_item' maps percentage to list item, 'ordered_list_item_to_percentage' maps item to percentage, 'process_range' generates a list of range values.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The 'range' processing appears normal, and the functions do not execute external commands or handle sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for mapping between list positions and percentages, as well as processing numeric ranges. All functions handle input validation and use simple calculations. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The functions operate purely on in-memory data, with no network or file I/O, and do not process untrusted external sources beyond simple data inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for list and range processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured, with proper validation, and does not perform any dangerous operations.",
