  "purpose": "Utility functions for mapping between percentages and ordered list items, and processing numerical ranges.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'ordered_list', 'percentage', 'range_vals' (dict with 'range' keys).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data being written to external systems, network, or files.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed locally with simple calculations; no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Functions perform straightforward calculations. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for converting between list items and percentages, as well as processing range dictionaries. It performs validation on inputs, such as ensuring the list isn't empty and that items are in the list. The range processing function builds a list of supported values within specified min, max, and step, appending the max if missing. All operations are standard and do not include suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions with no malicious behavior detected. It performs safe list and range operations without external side effects or suspicious activity.",
