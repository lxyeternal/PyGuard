  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between percentages and list items, and processing numeric ranges.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: ordered_list, item, range_vals",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output list items, percentages, or processed range values",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through computations to return values; no external data or untrusted sources are involved",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no dynamic code execution, and no hidden behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions: 'percentage_to_ordered_list_item' maps a percentage to an item in a list; 'ordered_list_item_to_percentage' finds the percentage position of an item; 'process_range' generates a list of supported range values from a dict. All functions perform simple calculations and validations without external data sources or side effects. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be well-structured, standard, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides utility functions for list and range manipulations with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is benign and suitable for use in applications requiring such conversions.",
