  "purpose": "Utility functions for mapping percentages to list items, list items to percentages, and processing range dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'ordered_list', 'item', and 'range_vals' dictionaries containing range specifications.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data processed internally with no external communication or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and then processed through straightforward calculations; no external data flows or injections.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is clear, simple, and performs standard list and range operations without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three utility functions: one maps a percentage to an item in an ordered list, another maps an item to its percentage, and the third processes a range dictionary to generate a list of supported values. Validation checks are present for empty lists and missing items. The range processing correctly includes the maximum value if not already present. The logic is standard, with no external dependencies, network activity, or obfuscation. The functions operate solely on in-memory data, with proper validation and straightforward calculations. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward utility functions with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
