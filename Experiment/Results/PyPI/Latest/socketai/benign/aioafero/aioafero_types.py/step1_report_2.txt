  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different event types related to resource and connection status.",
  "sources": "The class definition and enum members, which are static string assignments.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks, user input, or external data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or input/output operations are present; the code is purely static.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no unusual or suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with several string members representing various event types. There are no external inputs, network calls, or data processing. No potential attack vectors or malicious patterns are visible. The structure and content are typical for an enum definition in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard enum declaration used to categorize event types. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
