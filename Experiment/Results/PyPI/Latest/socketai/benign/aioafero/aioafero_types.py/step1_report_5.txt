  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for various event types related to resource management and connection status.",
  "sources": "The code imports the Enum class from the enum module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from input sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The Enum values are straightforward string literals.",
  "analysis": "The code creates an Enum class named EventType with members representing different event states. The implementation is standard, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity. No external data handling, input/output operations, or security-sensitive code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Enum definition used for categorizing event types. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
