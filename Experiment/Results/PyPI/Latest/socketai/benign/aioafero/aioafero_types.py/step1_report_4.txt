{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class for various event types related to resource and connection states.",
  "sources": "The code reads the class definition and the enum member values, primarily static string assignments.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data influences other parts of the code or causes security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external input to any sink; the enum members are statically defined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code structures, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a simple enum class with static string members representing event types. It does not process external input, perform network operations, access environment variables, or execute any dynamic code. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. It is straightforward and standard usage of the enum module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard definition of an enum class used for categorizing event types. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
