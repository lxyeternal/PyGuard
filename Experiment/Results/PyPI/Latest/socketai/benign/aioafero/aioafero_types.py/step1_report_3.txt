  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different event types related to resource management and connection status.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as the code only defines an enum.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the enum is straightforward with descriptive string values.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class and defines a class EventType inheriting from Enum, with string values representing different event types. There are no external data inputs, no complex logic, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns. The code appears to serve as a simple, static enumeration for use elsewhere in a larger application. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard enumeration definition for event types with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions as a straightforward part of a larger codebase.",
