  "purpose": "Define a set of event types as string constants for use in event handling or logging.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static code defining enum members.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static enum declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum class with string values.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static Python Enum class with string members representing various event types. It contains no dynamic code, no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence, and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions mean it poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard enumeration with no security issues or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.",
