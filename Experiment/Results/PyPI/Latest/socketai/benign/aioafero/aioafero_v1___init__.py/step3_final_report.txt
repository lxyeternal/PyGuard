  "purpose": "A Python client library for controlling Afero IoT devices via the v1 API, managing authentication, device control, event subscriptions, and data fetching.",
  "sources": "API responses, user credentials, device IDs, tokens, environment variables, and configuration parameters used in network requests and callbacks.",
  "sinks": "HTTP responses, callback functions, event streams, and data flows from API responses to device state updates and event emissions.",
  "flows": "Credentials and tokens flow from authentication methods to request headers; data flows from API responses to device controllers and event handlers; user inputs trigger API requests and callbacks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. Usage of standard libraries and patterns is consistent with typical API clients.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard async patterns, request retries, token management, and event handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The structure and logic follow best practices for secure API communication. The absence of obfuscation and hardcoded secrets further supports its legitimacy. The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting typical risks associated with networked device control but no specific vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for managing Afero IoT devices. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent has been found. The low security risk score is justified given the context. Overall, it poses no supply chain security threat based on the provided analysis.",
