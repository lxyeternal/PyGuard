  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports identify a typographical error in the import statement: `'anonomyize_data'` instead of `'anonymize_data'`.\n   - The core code is straightforward, involving module exports, version retrieval, and imports.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks is observed.\n   - The typo could cause runtime import errors but is not malicious.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report:**\n   - The reports are consistent in identifying the typo.\n   - They correctly note that this typo is likely accidental.\n   - No other logical flaws or security issues are highlighted.\n   - The reports assign a low security risk score (~0.1 to 0.2), which seems appropriate given the context.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Security risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), aligning with the minor typo and lack of malicious activity.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No scores above 0.5 are assigned, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations, nor does it handle untrusted data.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified.\n   - There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly assume the typo is accidental.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - Given the analysis, they seem appropriate.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minor typo, unlikely to cause security issues but could affect functionality.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard package initialization script with a minor typo in an import statement. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The typo should be corrected to prevent runtime errors, but it does not constitute a security concern.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1            |\n\nThis careful review confirms that the code is generally safe, with the only issue being a typo that should be fixed for proper functionality.",
