  "purpose": "Define exports and retrieve package version information for the 'aioafero' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements, package version retrieval, and list of exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or user input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; primarily static imports and variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in import: 'anonomyize_data' instead of 'anonymize_data'. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a list of exported symbols, attempts to retrieve the package version dynamically, and handles a possible PackageNotFoundError. The typo in the import path indicates a probable mistake or typo in module naming but not malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or data leaks. The package version retrieval is standard practice and does not involve unsafe inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization script with a minor typo in an import statement. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It primarily sets up module exports and retrieves version info.",
