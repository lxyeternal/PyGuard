  "purpose": "Define exports and version handling for the aioafero package, including importing modules and setting version info.",
  "sources": "Import statements for package version, module imports, and the package name 'aioafero'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no user input handling or data processing that could lead to data leaks or injections.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up module imports and version info.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in import statement: 'anonomyize_data' instead of 'anonymize_data'. No other suspicious or unusual code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes the module's public interface list, attempts to retrieve the package version dynamically, and imports various submodules. The version retrieval uses standard 'importlib.metadata' functions with exception handling. The typo in the import statement ('anonomyize_data') suggests a likely mistake or typo, not malicious intent. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. Overall, the code is typical module setup code with a minor typo.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup script with a typo in an import statement. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The typo appears accidental rather than malicious.",
