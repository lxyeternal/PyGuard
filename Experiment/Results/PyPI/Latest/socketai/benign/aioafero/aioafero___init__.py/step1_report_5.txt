  "purpose": "Define module exports, handle versioning, and import submodules and components for the 'aioafero' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements, package version retrieval, and module attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code mainly involves importing and setting attributes.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Typo in module name 'anonomyize_data' which should likely be 'anonymize_data'; no malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes module exports and attempts to retrieve the package version, defaulting to 'unknown' if not found. It imports various submodules and components, which is typical for package initialization. The typo in the import statement ('anonomyize_data' instead of 'anonymize_data') appears to be a simple mistake rather than malicious behavior. There are no apparent sources of untrusted data, no code injections, or suspicious behavior. The version check and exception handling are standard practices. Overall, the code is straightforward and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as an initial setup for a Python package, with standard imports and version handling. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The only notable issue is a likely typo in an import statement, which is not security-related.",
