  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Version info source to __version__; import statement to submodule usage.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in import statement: 'anonomyize_data' instead of 'anonymize_data'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initialization script. It defines public API exports, retrieves package version info with exception handling, and imports submodules. The main concern is a typo in the import statement which would cause an ImportError at runtime, but this is not malicious. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1-0.2) are appropriate, reflecting a minor bug rather than a security issue. The typo should be corrected to ensure proper functionality, but it does not constitute a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with a minor typo causing potential import errors. No malware or malicious activity is detected. The low security risk score is justified; fixing the typo is recommended to prevent runtime errors.",
