{
  "purpose": "This code defines public API exports and handles version retrieval for the 'aioafero' package, including importing modules and managing package version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads package version info via 'importlib.metadata.version' and imports specific modules and classes from relative paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input handling, external data processing, or data leakage mechanisms are present. No sensitive data is used or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The version info is obtained and assigned to '__version__'; no data flows from external sources to sinks involving untrusted data. Module imports are static.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in import: 'anonomyize_data' likely intended as 'anonymize_data'; potential typo but not malicious. No other anomalies or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward module exports, handles package version retrieval with exception fallback, and imports various components. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious logic detected. The typo in import could cause import errors but is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package initialization code with a minor typo in an import statement. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
