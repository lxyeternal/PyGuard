  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines `__all__` for public API exports.\n- Retrieves package version info via `importlib.metadata.version` with exception handling.\n- Imports several submodules and classes.\n- Contains a typo in the import statement: `'anonomyize_data'` instead of `'anonymize_data'`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Typographical error in import statement:** All reports agree on the typo `'anonomyize_data'`. This would likely cause an `ImportError` at runtime unless the module is named exactly as written, which seems unlikely. This is a bug, but not malicious.\n\n### Are there any security concerns or malicious behaviors?\n- **No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code.** The code is standard package setup code.\n- **No data leaks, user input handling, or external data processing.**\n- **No network activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior.**\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The typo in `'anonomyize_data'` is a clear mistake that could prevent the package from functioning correctly, but it is not malicious.\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.1 or 0.2, citing the typo as a minor security risk. This is somewhat subjective; a typo is a bug, not a security risk. The risk score should probably be **closer to 0** unless the typo leads to runtime errors that could be exploited, which is unlikely.\n\n### Justification for risk score:\n- The only notable issue is the typo, which is a bug, not a security vulnerability. Therefore, **risk score should be 0**.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' findings: no malware, no obfuscation, minor typo, and no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (typo is a bug, not a security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Additional recommendations:\n- Fix the typo `'anonomyize_data'` to `'anonymize_data'` to prevent import errors.\n- Consider removing or lowering the risk score to 0, as the typo does not constitute a security risk.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Suggested Score | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                      | No malicious code or behavior detected                     |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                      | No obfuscation present                                       |\n| Security Risk  | 0                      | Typo is a bug, not a security issue                          |\n\nThis analysis aligns with the reports' consensus and the code's actual behavior.",
