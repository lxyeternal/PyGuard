  "purpose": "Provides an interface for anonymizing device data by replacing identifiable information with anonymized identifiers.",
  "sources": "Reading device data via function parameters; accessing device attributes such as id, children, states, and device_id.",
  "sinks": "Assigning new values to device attributes like id, device_id, and state values; generating UUIDs for anonymization.",
  "flows": "Input device data -> generate parent mappings -> anonymize device IDs and device links -> anonymize states -> output anonymized device dicts.",
  "anomalies": "Use of global variable FNAME_IND for naming devices may indicate state persistence but not malicious; no suspicious code behaviors or backdoors observed; no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically replaces sensitive device identifiers with generated UUIDs, ensuring anonymization. It maintains mappings between original and new IDs, and resets time-related fields to neutral values. The use of global variables is benign in this context. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The functions perform expected anonymization tasks without external communications or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard anonymization utility designed to strip identifiable information from device data. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The code is intended for data privacy purposes and does not pose security threats.",
