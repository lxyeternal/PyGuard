  "purpose": "Static configuration data defining API endpoints, identifiers, and URLs for client applications, with no dynamic or sensitive data.",
  "sources": "Constants defining URLs, domain names, application IDs, and other static parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or user input processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static data used for configuration, no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward static configuration with no secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constants used for API endpoints and client configuration. No dynamic data, secrets, or code execution occurs. URLs are standard OAuth/OpenID endpoints, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The code is well-structured, readable, and free of any signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static configuration data with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
