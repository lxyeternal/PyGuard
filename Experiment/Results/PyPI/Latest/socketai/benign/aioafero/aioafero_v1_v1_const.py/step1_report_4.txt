  "purpose": "Define configuration constants for multiple Afero client accounts, including URLs and identifiers.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for API URLs, domain names, and client identifiers within the code.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no use of untrusted external input or data handling points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data used for configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets beyond configuration data, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static dictionary with configuration parameters for different clients, including URLs, domain names, and identifiers. All data appears to be predefined configuration constants. No user input, external data, or executable code is present. No functions, no environment variable reads, and no dynamic code execution. The URLs and identifiers seem appropriate for configuration purposes and do not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely contains static data for client configurations and does not perform any operations that could be malicious.",
