  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, assessing the evidence, reasoning, and scoring, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The report correctly identifies that the code is static configuration data, with no dynamic or malicious elements. URLs are well-formed, and no secrets or secrets are embedded.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This aligns with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely static configuration, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it notes the static nature and absence of malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, static configuration data, no secrets or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid conclusion.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Static constants with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, with a note of \"securityRisk\": 0.1, which is slightly above zero.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The minimal risk score seems to be a conservative placeholder, as the data is purely static configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence & Content:** All reports agree that the code is static configuration data with URLs and constants, no dynamic or user-input data, no secrets, no code execution, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- **Security Risk:** The only slight deviation is in report 5, which assigns a risk score of 0.1. Given the static nature and absence of secrets or malicious patterns, this is an overly cautious but not unreasonable placeholder. However, a risk score of 0.1 suggests a very low but non-zero concern, which isn't justified here.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Confirmed as 0 across all reports; no change needed.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0; no change needed.\n- **Risk Score:** Since all data are static configuration with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent, the risk score should be 0 for all reports, including report 5, rather than 0.1.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- No code flow, no dynamic data, no secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior detected.\n- The URLs are public endpoints, typical for OAuth/OpenID flows, and do not indicate malicious activity.\n- The minimal risk score in report 5 should be adjusted to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is benign configuration data with no malicious or security risks. The scores should reflect zero risk and no malware or obfuscation.",
