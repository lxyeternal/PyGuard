{
  "purpose": "Define configuration constants for Afero clients with their respective API and auth URLs.",
  "sources": "Constants are hardcoded within the script, primarily from the 'AFERO_CLIENTS' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; URLs are static strings, not derived from user input.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; all data are static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscation or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static configuration dictionary for two clients ('hubspace' and 'myko'), including URLs and identifiers. All URLs and parameters appear to be well-formed and static. No dynamic execution, environment variables, or user inputs are used, which reduces the likelihood of malicious behavior. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or secret exfiltration mechanisms. The 'Final' annotations are for immutability and do not pose security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as static configuration data for client applications with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward setup of API endpoints and client parameters without any malicious or harmful code.",
