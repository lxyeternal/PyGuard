  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static configuration data with hardcoded URLs, identifiers, and constants.\n- No user input, dynamic code, or external data sources are involved.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are identified.\n- The URLs are standard OAuth/OpenID endpoints, not malicious or suspicious.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No issues, malware, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** The code is static configuration with no malicious intent.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward configuration.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; static constants, no secrets or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** Configuration data only.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous; static configuration.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** No malicious or risky behavior.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, but notes a security risk of 0.1.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** The slight security risk score might be due to the presence of URLs that could be targeted or misused, but given the data, this is minimal and likely overestimating. No secrets or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All correctly assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk scores:** Should be 0 for all, given the absence of secrets, secrets, or malicious intent. The 0.1 assigned in report 5 seems unwarranted unless there's context not provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is purely static configuration data, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The risk scores should be **0** across all reports.\n- The malware score remains **0**.\n- The obfuscated score remains **0**.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' conclusions that this code is benign and safe.**",
