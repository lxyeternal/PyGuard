  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the security implications, scoring, and consistency.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The report states that the code is static configuration data with no malicious intent, no dynamic data, no secrets, and no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** This aligns with the code, which is purely static constants. No issues are present.\n- **Verdict:** The scoring is appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static configuration with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, static configuration data, no secrets, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—static configuration, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar static configuration data, with a slight mention of \"securityRisk\": 0.1.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score is marginally above zero, but given the code's nature, this seems overestimated. The code does not perform any operations, handle secrets, or execute untrusted data.\n- **Justification:** Since the code is static configuration with no dynamic or sensitive data, a security risk score of 0.1 is unjustified. It should remain at 0.\n- **Verdict:** The score should be adjusted to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as static configuration with no malicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, which is correct.\n- The securityRisk score in report 5 is slightly inflated; it should be 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code is straightforward, static configuration data for client applications, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
