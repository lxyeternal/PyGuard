  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration data for different clients, including URLs and application identifiers.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data assigned to constants; no user input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it does not perform data output, network requests, or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the configuration data is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code. The URLs appear to be legitimate endpoints for OAuth and API access.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static constants defining configuration parameters for two clients, including URLs, identifiers, and application data. The URLs and identifiers seem standard for OAuth/OpenID Connect workflows. No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The configuration appears straightforward and intended for API interaction, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static configuration module without any malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It does not include hardcoded secrets or code that could be exploited. Overall, it appears safe and typical for client configuration data.",
