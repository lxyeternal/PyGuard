  "purpose": "Define configuration constants for different client applications including URLs, identifiers, and encoding settings.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources; static definitions of configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks involved; no untrusted data output or external system interaction within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static data assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious URLs; data appears to be standard configuration information.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes constant dictionaries for two clients, each containing URL endpoints, application IDs, and other configuration parameters. These URLs are public endpoints for OAuth flows and API access, with no embedded secrets or sensitive data. No code execution, data manipulation, or input/output operations are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behavior. The structure is straightforward, and all data is static, serving as configuration constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup with no malicious behavior, no sensitive information, and no security risks identified. It merely defines static constants for client applications.",
