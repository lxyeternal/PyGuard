  "purpose": "Define constants for different clients including their API endpoints and configuration details",
  "sources": "Static assignment of configuration data and constants, no external data input sources",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output mechanisms",
  "flows": "None; all data is statically assigned with no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded URLs and credentials appear standard for configuration data",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of static constant definitions with no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network operations. It stores configuration details such as URLs, user agents, and identifiers for two clients. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. There are no suspicious behaviors like backdoors, hidden network communications, or obfuscated code. The constants seem to serve as configuration data for legitimate application purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup with hardcoded constants and URLs for two clients. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present. The code appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
