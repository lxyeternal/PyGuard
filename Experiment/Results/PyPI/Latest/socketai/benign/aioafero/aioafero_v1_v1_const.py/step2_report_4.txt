  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is purely static configuration data with no dynamic or malicious elements. URLs and parameters are well-formed, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — all consistent with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, static configuration constants with no dynamic data or malicious behavior. No secrets or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, straightforward configuration.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, static data with OAuth URLs and identifiers, no secrets or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Static configuration data, no secrets or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Safe configuration.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern — static constants, no secrets, no malicious code. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), but given the nature of configuration data, this is likely an overestimation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable but perhaps slightly inflated.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static configuration data with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is accurate.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The securityRisk scores are zero in four reports, with one report at 0.1, which is acceptable given the context.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is benign; no changes needed.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 in report 5 could be lowered to 0, as the data is purely static configuration with no security implications.\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: static, well-formed configuration data with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
