  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static configuration data, with no dynamic or user-input-driven behavior.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic are detected.\n- URLs are standard OAuth/OpenID endpoints, with no embedded secrets or sensitive data.\n- The code is simple, with constants defining API endpoints and identifiers.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Claim:** No malicious activity, static configuration.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Justification:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code content. No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Claim:** Similar to Report 1, standard configuration data.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Claim:** Same as above, benign static data.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Justification:** No issues identified; scores are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Claim:** Straightforward configuration data, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Justification:** The analysis is consistent with the code content.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Claim:** Same as others, static configuration, no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Justification:** The only deviation is a small security risk score of 0.1, which the report justifies as minimal, given the data is static and public.\n\n**Discussion:** A risk score of 0.1 is acceptable here, reflecting a very low security concern. Since no secrets, secrets, or dynamic behaviors are present, this is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, static code.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0 or very close to 0, justified by the static, non-sensitive nature of the configuration data.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n- The code is a straightforward static configuration module for client API endpoints and identifiers.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk beyond standard configuration)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the actual security posture of the code snippet.",
