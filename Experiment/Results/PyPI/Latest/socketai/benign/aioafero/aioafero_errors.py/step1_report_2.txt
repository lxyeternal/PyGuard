  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to Afero device management.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data output or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward class inheritance with no unusual features, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Exception and a base class AferoError. There are no input sources, data flows, or sinks. The structure is typical for error handling in Python projects. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard set of custom exception definitions used for error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a safe, benign snippet likely part of a larger project.",
