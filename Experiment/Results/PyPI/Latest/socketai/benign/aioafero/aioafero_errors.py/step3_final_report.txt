  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to Afero devices.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definitions are static and self-contained.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or execution beyond class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from a base AferoError, which itself inherits from Python's Exception. The classes are empty, serving solely as error categories. No external input, data processing, or dynamic behavior is present. The code is standard, benign, and commonly used for structured error handling. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports' assessments are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
