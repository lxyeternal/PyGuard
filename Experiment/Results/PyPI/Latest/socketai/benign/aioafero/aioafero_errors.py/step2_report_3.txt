  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from `Exception` and a base class `AferoError`. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and typical for error handling in Python.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is simple, standard, and free of malicious intent. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - `obfuscated`: 0  \n   These scores are appropriate given the code content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation, higher scores are unjustified. The reports' scores are reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Overall Evaluation & Final Estimation**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code snippet is a standard set of exception class definitions, with no malicious or security concern indications.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately assess the code as benign. No changes to scores are necessary. The code appears to be a legitimate, safe part of a larger project, serving as structured error handling classes.",
