  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in an Afero-related application.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data outputs; purely class definitions for exceptions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or logic beyond class inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. No external data is read, processed, or output. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The classes serve as structured error types, which is standard practice. There are no apparent security issues or malicious intent in these class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for error handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger codebase for managing device-related errors.",
