  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to Afero devices and errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading sources; purely class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; no processing of untrusted data or outputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only defines exceptions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward exception class definitions with standard inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. These classes are standard Python class definitions for error handling and do not include any dynamic code execution, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code. The structure is clean and typical for exception hierarchies.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely consists of class definitions for exceptions with no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks. It appears to be a standard and benign part of a larger codebase.",
