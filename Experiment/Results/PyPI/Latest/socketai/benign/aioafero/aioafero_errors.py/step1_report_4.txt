  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to Afero device operations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely exception class hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception class. These classes serve to categorize errors like device not found, update errors, maximum retries exceeded, authentication issues, and invalid responses. There are no input/output operations, no external data handling, and no dynamic code execution. The structure is straightforward and standard for exception hierarchy definition. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, well-structured set of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger project for handling device-related errors, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
