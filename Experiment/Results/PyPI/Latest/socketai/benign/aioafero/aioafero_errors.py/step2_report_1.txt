  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\nThe provided code defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from a base class `AferoError`, which itself inherits from Python's built-in `Exception`. All classes are straightforward, with no additional logic, data, or dynamic behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code matches the description: simple class definitions for error handling. No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior are observed.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is standard, clean, and follows typical Python exception class patterns.\n\n- **Scores given in reports:**\n  - **Malware score:** 0 in all reports.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports.  \n  - **Risk score:** 0 in all reports.\n\n  These scores are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical analysis:\n\n1. **Malware and Obfuscation:**  \n   The code is transparent, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. The classes are simple and serve a clear purpose.\n\n2. **Security Risks:**  \n   The code only defines exception classes. No data processing, external input/output, or dynamic code execution is present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious imports.\n\n3. **Assumptions and claims:**  \n   The reports correctly state that the code is benign and standard. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis aligns with the code.\n\n4. **Score justification:**  \n   The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional considerations:**  \nSince the code is purely exception class definitions, there's no basis for higher scores. It’s a standard pattern used in many projects.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No modifications are necessary. The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
