  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Exception and a base class AferoError.\n   - There are no signs of data input/output, dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n   - The code appears standard, benign, and intended for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are noted.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports and the code itself show no malicious intent or security concerns, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - The code is purely for error categorization, with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity is indicated or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies or overestimations are present.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code snippet is a standard, straightforward set of exception class definitions used for error handling in a larger application. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and accurate.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the nature of the code.",
