  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the associated code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n1. Confirm if issues are present:\n- The code snippets are straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Exception and a base class AferoError.\n- No data input/output, external interactions, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious behavior.\n\nConclusion: No issues or malicious code are present in the code snippets.\n\n2. Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify that these are standard exception class definitions.\n- No logical errors, security flaws, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n- The reasoning in the reports is sound; they correctly dismiss any security concerns.\n\n3. Review scores:\n- All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and securityRisk = 0.\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- The confidence score of 1 in all reports is justified.\n\n4. Justify risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- No reason exists to assign higher risk scores since the code is purely for error handling with no malicious intent.\n\n5. Malware score considerations:\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is correct.\n- No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n- The reports correctly assume the code is benign; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are necessary.\n\n7. Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1 (minimal, as it's just exception classes, but to be conservative, still very low)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and typical for error handling.\n- No further security concerns are warranted based on this snippet.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
