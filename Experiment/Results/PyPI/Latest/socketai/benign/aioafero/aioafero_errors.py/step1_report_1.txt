  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to Afero devices and operations.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only class definitions and inheritance from Exception.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; solely class inheritance structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward exception class definitions without suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception, AferoError, which itself inherits from Python's Exception class. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The class definitions are simple and conventional, serving to categorize specific error conditions for an application or library related to Afero devices. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The structure appears standard and intentional for error handling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger application’s error handling framework. There are no indicators of malware or security risks in this snippet.",
