  "purpose": "A command-line utility that repeatedly prints a specified text until a duration or line count is reached, then outputs performance metrics.",
  "sources": "User-provided arguments for duration, line count, and custom text.",
  "sinks": "Standard output where the repeated text is printed; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Input arguments processed into variables; repeated printing of text based on duration or line count; metrics calculated after execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign utility for performance testing, with no network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior. It validates arguments, handles errors gracefully, and performs repeated output with metrics calculation. No anomalies or security issues are present. The use of modern syntax (match-case) does not introduce suspicion. The malware score is appropriately zero, obfuscation score zero, and security risk minimal (~0.1) due to potential misuse but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, simple utility with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are consistent with its benign nature. The minimal security risk score (~0.1) reflects potential misuse but does not indicate actual threat. Overall, the code is trustworthy and poses no security concern.",
