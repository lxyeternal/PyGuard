{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be a command-line utility that repeatedly prints a specified text (default 'uaua') for a set duration or number of lines, then outputs performance metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (argv), standard input, and system time.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout and stderr, mainly printing user-specified text and diagnostic information.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> argument processing -> printing loop (based on duration or line count) -> final metrics output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No external network communication, file modifications, or data exfiltration. Use of match-case is modern syntax but not suspicious. No obfuscation or suspicious imports beyond standard modules.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command-line arguments for duration, line count, and text. It then enters a loop printing the specified text repeatedly until the condition (duration or line count) is met, handling KeyboardInterrupt gracefully. It computes and prints performance metrics after execution. No network activity, no data leakage, no code injection, or suspicious data handling observed. The logic is straightforward and intended for a utility or test script, not malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a simple printing utility with performance metrics. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The code does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious patterns. It appears to be safe and benign.",
