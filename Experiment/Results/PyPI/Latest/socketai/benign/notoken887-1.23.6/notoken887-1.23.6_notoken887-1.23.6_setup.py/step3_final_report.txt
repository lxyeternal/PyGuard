{
  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata for 'notoken887' using setuptools, with no dynamic or executable code.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static metadata fields in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects within the code",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author_email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org') as metadata concerns; no malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup script with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The only notable anomalies are unprofessional contact info and a suspicious URL, which do not influence code execution or security. Malware score is 0, as no malicious code exists. Obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), reflecting metadata concerns rather than technical vulnerabilities. The code itself is benign; metadata issues could be used for social engineering but do not constitute security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The package is a benign static setup script with suspicious metadata that warrants caution but does not pose an active security threat. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
