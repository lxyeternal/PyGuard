{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple substitution cipher for encrypting and decrypting strings using emoji and character replacements.",
  "sources": "User input via input() function in main(), the string parameter in encrypt() method.",
  "sinks": "Return values of encrypt() and decrypt() methods; print output in main(). No external data sinks or network activities.",
  "flows": "User input flows into encrypt(), which outputs an encrypted string; this can be decrypted back via decrypt(). No external data flow beyond input and output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Replaces characters for encoding, which is a benign substitution cipher. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods: encrypt and decrypt, which perform character replacements for obfuscation. The main() function prompts the user for input, encrypts it, and displays the result. The process is straightforward and does not involve network operations, data leaks, or malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware such as data exfiltration, system modification, or covert channels. The implementation is simple substitution, likely for obfuscation purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic substitution cipher implementation without malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations, network activity, or data theft. No evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities based on the provided code.",
