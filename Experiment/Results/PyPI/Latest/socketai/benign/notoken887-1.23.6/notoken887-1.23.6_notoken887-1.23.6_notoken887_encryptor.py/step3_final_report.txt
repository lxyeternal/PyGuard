  "purpose": "A simple emoji substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings.",
  "sources": "User input via input() function.",
  "sinks": "Output via print() function.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through encrypt() or decrypt() methods, then outputted; no external data or network flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward substitution cipher with no obfuscation beyond emoji replacements.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a deterministic character replacement cipher, substituting characters with emojis in encrypt() and reversing in decrypt(). It uses direct string replacements without dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation techniques are present beyond the emoji substitutions, which are benign. The code is simple, predictable, and serves as a playful or obfuscation tool. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The signals across multiple reports are consistent, indicating benign intent with minimal security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is low (around 0.2), and overall security risk is negligible (~0.1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward emoji substitution cipher with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a playful encoding tool without any signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious activity. The current assessment scores are appropriate; a slight adjustment of the obfuscation score to 0.2 and risk to 0.1 would better reflect the minimal obfuscation and security concern.",
