  "purpose": "The code provides a simple character substitution cipher for encrypting and decrypting strings using emoji mappings.",
  "sources": "Input from the user via input() function.",
  "sinks": "Output to the console via print(), no untrusted data sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "User input -> encrypt method -> encrypted output -> console display; no other data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The substitution cipher is simple and not secure but not malicious. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The class TokenCryptor performs character replacement for encryption and decryption using fixed emoji mappings. The main() function prompts the user for input, encrypts it, and displays the result. The code is straightforward, with no external data sources, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. It does not contain malicious actions like data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors. The implementation is basic and appears solely for encoding/decoding text with a playful emoji scheme. There are no anomalies suggesting sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple substitution cipher with no malicious intent. It does not perform any harmful actions or security violations. Its security is minimal (not suitable for sensitive data), but there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
