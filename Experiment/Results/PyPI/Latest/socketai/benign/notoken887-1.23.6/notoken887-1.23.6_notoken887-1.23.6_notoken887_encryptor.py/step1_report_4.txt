{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple substitution cipher to encrypt and decrypt strings by replacing characters with emoji symbols.",
  "sources": "Input from user via input() function in main(), data passed to encrypt() method.",
  "sinks": "The encrypted string output to console. No data leaks or external communication present.",
  "flows": "User input -> encrypt() -> console output; no external network or file I/O involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward substitution cipher; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No obfuscation or suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The class TokenCryptor performs character replacement to encode/decode strings. The replace() method is used sequentially, which is safe in this context. The main() function gathers user input, encrypts it, and prints the result. There is no external data handling, network activity, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a benign obfuscation tool, possibly for playful or illustrative purposes, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign substitution cipher implementation with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs character-to-emoji substitution for encryption and decryption, with user interaction via console input and output.",
