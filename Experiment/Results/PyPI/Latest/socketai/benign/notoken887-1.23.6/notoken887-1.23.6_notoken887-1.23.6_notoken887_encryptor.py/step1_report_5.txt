{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple character substitution cipher for encrypting and decrypting strings using emojis as tokens.",
  "sources": "User input via the input() function in main().",
  "sinks": "Encrypted output printed to the console.",
  "flows": "User inputs a string -> encrypt() replaces characters with emojis -> output is printed. Decrypt() reverses this process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected. The use of straightforward replace() calls is simple and predictable.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic substitution cipher without involving any external data sources, network communication, or sensitive data handling. It only reads user input and outputs the transformed string. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or code injection. The use of emoji replacements is benign and purely for obfuscation or fun. The structure is clear and does not include any suspicious or obfuscated features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign character substitution cipher for encrypting and decrypting strings with emojis. There is no evidence of malware, malicious intent, or security risks in the provided code.",
