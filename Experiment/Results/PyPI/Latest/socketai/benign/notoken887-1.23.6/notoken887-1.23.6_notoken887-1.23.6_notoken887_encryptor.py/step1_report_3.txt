{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple symmetric substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings using emojis as symbols.",
  "sources": "The input() function reads user-provided strings from standard input.",
  "sinks": "The print() function outputs the encrypted string to standard output.",
  "flows": "User input flows from input() to encrypt(), then encrypted data flows to print().",
  "anomalies": "The code uses only straightforward string replacements for encryption/decryption without any network, file, or environment interactions; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The class TokenCryptor performs character substitution encryption and decryption with no external data sources, network activity, or secret handling. The encrypt and decrypt methods rely solely on replace() calls, which are deterministic and do not execute code or access sensitive data. The main() function handles user input and output, with no hidden behaviors or anomalies. The code appears to serve a simple obfuscation purpose without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic emoji-based substitution cipher with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration. Overall, it is benign and serves a straightforward purpose.",
