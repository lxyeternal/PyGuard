  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static configuration only",
  "flows": "Static data from file read into setup parameters; no dynamic or user-driven flows",
  "anomalies": "Unusual URL pointing to a WeChat article; use of distutils.core instead of setuptools, but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious dependencies. The URL is unconventional but benign. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. All indicators point to a benign package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain threats. The only minor anomaly is the unconventional URL, which does not pose a security risk.",
