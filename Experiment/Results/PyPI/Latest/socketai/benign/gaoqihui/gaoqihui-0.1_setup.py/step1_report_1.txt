  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'gaoqihui'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file for long_description; no other input sources.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sinks; primarily package metadata used during installation.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behavior observed. Uses standard packaging libraries and straightforward setup parameters.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads a description file, and calls setup() with static package metadata. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. The URL appears to be a benign link to a WeChat article, not an external malicious domain. The dependencies list is empty, indicating no external code execution or malicious dependency inclusion. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, benign Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
