  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file; importing modules; static package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output points that could be exploited for malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reading file -> defining package metadata -> executing setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures. The URL points to a WeChat link, which is not inherently malicious but unusual for a package metadata URL.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools, reads a README file, and configures package metadata for distribution. There are no dynamic inputs, no code execution beyond static setup invocation, and no suspicious patterns. The URL points to a WeChat article, which is unconventional but not malicious. The code does not contain any malware behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares package metadata for distribution.",
