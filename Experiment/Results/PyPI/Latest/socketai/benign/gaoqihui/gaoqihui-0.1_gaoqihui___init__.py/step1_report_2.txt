  "purpose": "Import the 'jichu' object or module from a local package or module named 'jichu'.",
  "sources": "The source is the local import statement 'from .jichu import jichu'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; it only performs an import.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or data processing in this snippet; it's solely an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement; no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import from a local module or package. It does not perform any operations, data handling, or external communication. As it stands, this is a standard import statement typical in Python projects. No malicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The import could be part of larger, benign code, or could be malicious if the imported module is malicious, but based solely on this line, there is no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard practice in Python projects.",
