  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Slightly elevated risk scores (0.1) are acceptable due to the possibility of malicious modules if the imported module is compromised, but this cannot be determined from this line alone."
