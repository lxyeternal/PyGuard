  "purpose": "Import the 'jichu' class or function from a local module named 'jichu'.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or vulnerable operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this minimal snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; it only performs a local import with no additional logic or context. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a component from a local module, which is a standard practice. Since it does not include any input handling, data processing, network operations, or other actions, there are no obvious security issues or malicious behaviors. The presence of only an import statement limits the analysis, but nothing suspicious is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detectable in this fragment.",
