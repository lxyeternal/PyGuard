{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'jichu' class or function from a local module named 'jichu'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only performing an import without additional logic or context. No suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single relative import statement. It appears to be part of a larger module or package. There are no visible signs of malicious behavior, such as dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The import source is a local module, and no external data is involved. Given the limited scope, no malicious intent can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no indication of malicious activity or security risks. It appears benign and standard for Python modules.",
