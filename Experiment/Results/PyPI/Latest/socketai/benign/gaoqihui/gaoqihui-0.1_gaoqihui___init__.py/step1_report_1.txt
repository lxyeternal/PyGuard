  "purpose": "Import the 'jichu' component from a local module in the same package.",
  "sources": "The code imports a module component; no data input or external data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this single line; no data is being processed or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code simply performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import from a local module, which is typical in Python packages. It contains no malicious or suspicious constructs, no external data sources, or dangerous behaviors. Since the code is only an import statement, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is typical package code with no apparent risks.",
