  "purpose": "Import 'jichu' from a local module named 'jichu'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or execution flow beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward relative import with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import from a local module, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify this as benign. Malware scores are appropriately zero; security risk scores are very low (around 0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal risk. The confidence in benign nature is high (above 0.8). No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident from this line alone.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Slightly elevated risk scores (0.1) are acceptable due to the possibility of malicious modules if the imported module is compromised, but this cannot be determined from this line alone.",
