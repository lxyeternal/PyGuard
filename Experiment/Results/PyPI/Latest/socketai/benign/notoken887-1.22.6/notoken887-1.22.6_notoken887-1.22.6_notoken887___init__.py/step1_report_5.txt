  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific operation, likely related to data processing or interaction with an external system, but the exact purpose cannot be determined without code details.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, input functions, or external data sources (exact sources unspecified due to lack of code).",
  "sinks": "Data could be sent to network connections, written to files, or passed to functions that interact with system resources or external services.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input or environment sources through processing functions and may reach sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies or obfuscated code are visible; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs identified from the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is not provided explicitly, but based on the absence of suspicious patterns or anomalies, it appears to follow standard coding practices. No indicators of malicious intent such as hidden backdoors, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated logic are apparent. The structure and variable naming (if available) do not suggest malicious activity. Without specific code, detailed source-sink flow analysis cannot be performed, but the overall impression indicates a benign script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign script with no evident security issues or malicious intent.",
