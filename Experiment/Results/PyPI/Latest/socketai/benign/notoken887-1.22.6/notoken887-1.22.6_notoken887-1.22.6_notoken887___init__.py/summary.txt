  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which elevate suspicion but lack concrete evidence of malicious payloads. Scores are appropriately cautious, reflecting potential risks without overestimating threats. Continued vigilance is recommended, especially for eval/exec and network activity, but current evidence does not justify high malware or security risk scores."
