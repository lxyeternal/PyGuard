  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and code anomalies based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "eval/exec with untrusted data, network interactions, obfuscated code segments, external data flows, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communication channels, external sinks, code execution points with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input sources to eval/exec or dynamic code execution, data flows to external servers or sinks, network activity linked to obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials, external data flows, lack of code or missing code context.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits common security concerns such as eval/exec with untrusted input, obfuscation, and network interactions. Reports indicate suspicion levels correlating with obfuscation and dynamic execution. Scores are generally consistent with the described behaviors: Report 2 shows higher obfuscation (0.6) and malware suspicion (0.4), justified by network activity and obfuscation. Reports without evidence of malicious activity maintain low scores (0 or 0.2). The overall assessment suggests moderate risk (~0.3-0.4), with malware suspicion around 0.2, and obfuscation around 0.4. No definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, but code behaviors warrant cautious monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which elevate suspicion but lack concrete evidence of malicious payloads. Scores are appropriately cautious, reflecting potential risks without overestimating threats. Continued vigilance is recommended, especially for eval/exec and network activity, but current evidence does not justify high malware or security risk scores.",
