{
  "purpose": "Performs simple string substitution: replaces 'M' with '∩' and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input tokens passed to encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "No external data or system effects; only string replacements within the code.",
  "flows": "Input token -> replace 'M' with '∩' -> output encrypted token; encrypted token -> replace '∩' with 'M' -> output decrypted token.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Unicode character '∩' (∩) is minimal obfuscation; no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs trivial string replacements, serving as a simple obfuscation method rather than encryption. No external data sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of Unicode character is superficial and does not indicate obfuscation beyond trivial substitution. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are detected. The code is benign, with scores reflecting minimal obfuscation and security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a trivial string substitution utility with no malicious behavior or security implications. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring aligns with the code's simplicity. No further revisions are necessary.",
