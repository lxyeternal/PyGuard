  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Original Code Summary:**\n- Class `TokenCryptor` with methods `encrypt` and `decrypt`.\n- `encrypt`: replaces `'M'` with `'∩'` (Unicode U+2229).\n- `decrypt`: replaces `'∩'` back with `'M'`.\n- Very simple string substitution, no external dependencies, no malicious code, no obfuscation beyond trivial character replacement.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes a substitution cipher replacing `'M'` with `'∩'`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just a trivial cipher, insecure for real encryption.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (very low, since it's insecure but not malicious)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (not obfuscated)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9 (reasonable)  \n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Obfuscation via replacing `'M'` with `'∩'`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above; trivial obfuscation, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.2 (slightly obfuscated but trivial)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9  \n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The low obfuscation score aligns with the trivial nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous, character substitution.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, simple obfuscation.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The report appropriately notes the triviality.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just string replacement.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.1  \n  - Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same, character substitution.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, trivial transformation.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Slightly varies but remains low, reflecting the trivial substitution. Some reports assign 0.1 or 0.2, which seems reasonable given the minimal obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** All assign very low scores, which is appropriate since the code is insecure for encryption but not malicious.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No report overstates or understates the risk.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Judgment:**\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0.1 (a minimal obfuscation)  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (due to insecurity but no malicious intent)\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is trivial, insecure, and serves only as a simple character substitution.  \n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.  \n- The obfuscation is superficial, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The scores are reasonable, and there is no evidence to suggest any malicious or high-security risk behavior. The overall risk is minimal, primarily due to the insecure nature of the \"encryption,\" but not malicious.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware score at **0**.  \n- Obfuscated at **0.1**.  \n- Security risk at **0.1**.  \n\nThis aligns with the benign, trivial nature of the code.",
