  "purpose": "A simple class providing token encryption and decryption by replacing specific characters.",
  "sources": "Input tokens provided to encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting the transformed token; no untrusted data directly affects other system components.",
  "flows": "Input token → encrypt/decrypt method → character replacement → output token.",
  "anomalies": "Use of character replacement as encryption is trivial and ineffective; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward class with methods that perform basic string replacement operations. The 'encrypt' method replaces 'M' with '∩', and 'decrypt' reverses this operation. There are no external data reads, network operations, or environment variable usages. The simplicity indicates this is a minimal, possibly illustrative, encoding scheme, not intended for security. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or backdoors, is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and does not exhibit malicious intent. It appears to be a trivial token transformation without any security significance or malicious functionality.",
