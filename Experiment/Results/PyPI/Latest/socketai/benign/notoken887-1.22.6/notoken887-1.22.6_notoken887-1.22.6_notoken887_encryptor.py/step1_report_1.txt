{
  "purpose": "A simple class providing a basic substitution cipher for tokens, replacing 'M' with '∩' and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'token' in encrypt() and 'encrypted_token' in decrypt() functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting modified tokens; no external data sinks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input tokens are transformed through string replacements and returned; no external flows or data leaks involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of only string replacement for encryption indicates a non-secure, trivial method; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods for simple character substitution, which do not involve external input/output or system modifications. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The substitution is insecure as an encryption method but does not constitute malicious code. No obfuscation or complex control flow present. Overall, the code appears benign and intentionally simple, serving as a basic obfuscation rather than security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a trivial substitution cipher with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks but is insecure for real encryption purposes. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
