{
  "purpose": "Simple token obfuscation by replacing specific characters",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'token' in encrypt method and 'encrypted_token' in decrypt method",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting the transformed token strings",
  "flows": "Input token → replace 'M' with '∩' in encrypt → output encrypted token; encrypted token → replace '∩' with 'M' in decrypt → output original token",
  "anomalies": "The code performs trivial character replacement; no hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or suspicious operations are present; no external data or network activity",
  "analysis": "The class provides basic character substitution functions that do not involve external input beyond the parameters. No data leaks, no malicious code, no complex logic, and no third-party dependencies. The methods are straightforward and do not contain obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious side effects. The design suggests simple obfuscation, not encryption. There are no signs of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward character replacement utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or data exfiltration. The implementation is simple and benign.",
