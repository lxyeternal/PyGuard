{
  "purpose": "The class provides a simplistic method for 'encrypting' and 'decrypting' a token by replacing specific characters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'token' and 'encrypted_token' in the methods encrypt() and decrypt()",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output the modified token strings",
  "flows": "Input token -> replace method -> output encrypted/decrypted token",
  "anomalies": "The 'encryption' mechanism is trivial, relying solely on character replacement with no cryptographic security. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The methods do not perform any suspicious network activity or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods: encrypt and decrypt, which perform character substitution. The substitution is very basic and does not provide any real security or obfuscation. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious data handling. There are no external dependencies, data leaks, or suspicious operations. Overall, the code appears to serve a simple obfuscation purpose, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimalistic obfuscation utility that replaces 'M' with '∩' and vice versa. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its simplicity suggests it is not intended for secure encryption but merely for trivial string modification.",
