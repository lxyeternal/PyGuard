{
  "purpose": "A simple class providing obfuscation for a token by replacing characters, ostensibly for encryption/decryption purposes.",
  "sources": "The 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods that read the input token and encrypted token, respectively.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data affects external systems or leaks data; only string replacements are performed.",
  "flows": "Input token flows through 'encrypt' to produce obfuscated token; the obfuscated token flows through 'decrypt' to recover original token.",
  "anomalies": "The class uses trivial character replacement for 'encryption', which is insecure and does not constitute real encryption. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected. The use of characters like '∩' is benign but may be misleading.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods: 'encrypt' replaces 'M' with '∩' and 'decrypt' reverses this. This is a simplistic obfuscation technique, not encryption, and offers no security. There are no input sources from external data streams, network, or environment variables. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The design does not perform any harmful operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic character substitution for token obfuscation and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform real encryption and should not be used to protect sensitive data, but it poses no security threat or malware risk.",
