  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package related to Slurm REST API, mainly for installation and dependency management.",
  "sources": "No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used in this script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the script focuses on package configuration and dependencies.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the script only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears standard for a setup.py file.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions from setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and packaging options. It includes no dynamic code, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The dependencies listed are well-known packages with no signs of malicious modification. The code contains only static configuration and comments, with no potential for malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines package metadata and dependencies, with no dynamic or insecure operations.",
