{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script (`setup.py`) used for packaging the `aind-slurm-rest-v2` library. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration without any dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata definitions, such as package name, version, author info, dependencies, and setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user inputs, environment variables, or network/file operations are present; thus, no sinks for malicious data.",
  "flows": "N/A - the script executes static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, standard `setup.py` script that imports `setuptools`, defines package metadata, dependencies, and calls `setup()` with fixed arguments. No dynamic code, user input, environment variables, network operations, or obfuscation are present. The author email and URL are legitimate and typical. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code poses no security risks or malware threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package configuration script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
