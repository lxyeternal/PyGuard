{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'aind-slurm-rest-v2', providing configuration for installation and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, package metadata definitions, setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code does not execute untrusted data or perform network/file operations directly.",
  "flows": "The setup() function uses static parameters to configure package installation; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup file, defining package metadata, dependencies, and installation instructions. It imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static arguments. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The only concern could be the author email, but it appears legitimate and is part of package metadata. Overall, it looks like a legitimate, well-structured package setup script without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It only defines package configuration and dependencies.",
