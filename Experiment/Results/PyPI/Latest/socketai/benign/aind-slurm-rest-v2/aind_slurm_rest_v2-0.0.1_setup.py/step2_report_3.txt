  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence and functionality**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a standard Python `setup.py` script for packaging a library named `aind-slurm-rest-v2`. The code imports `setuptools`, defines metadata, dependencies, and calls `setup()` with static arguments. No dynamic code, user input, or external data processing is involved.\n\n2. **Malicious behavior and anomalies**:  \n   No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or network operations are present. The email and URL are standard contact info, not suspicious. The code is straightforward and typical for a package setup script.\n\n3. **Security risks and malware**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code. The risk scores are also 0, reflecting no security concerns.\n\n4. **Scores consistency and justification**:  \n   - The reports' scores are consistent with their analysis—no malware, obfuscation, or security risks detected.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No report suggests any reason to increase the malware or risk scores.\n\n5. **Potential issues or assumptions**:  \n   - The only minor point is the empty `url` field, but this is common in setup scripts and not suspicious.\n   - The author email appears legitimate and is part of package metadata, not an indicator of malicious intent.\n\n**Final assessment**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**My own estimate**:  \nGiven the detailed analysis and the consistency across reports, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.  \n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0",
