  "purpose": "Define a generic API response object model for use in data serialization and validation.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines a data model and imports.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or external output functions.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process or handle data flows or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'arbitrary_types_allowed' set to True in model_config, which could permit injection of malicious types if untrusted types are used externally. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic Pydantic data model for API responses with fields for status_code, headers, data, and raw_data. It uses standard typing and Pydantic features. No external inputs are processed directly within this code snippet; it is purely a data structure definition. The setting 'arbitrary_types_allowed' is permissive but not inherently malicious; it allows any type for 'data'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No external network activity, code execution, or sensitive data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of an API response model with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. Its permissive 'arbitrary_types_allowed' setting warrants cautious use if untrusted types are integrated externally, but in isolation, it is benign.",
