{
  "purpose": "Define a generic API response data model for serialization and validation using pydantic.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code defines a data structure.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only declares a class structure without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' set to True in model_config, which can potentially allow unvalidated types, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic class 'ApiResponse' extending pydantic's BaseModel for API responses. It specifies type-annotated fields for status code, headers, data, and raw data, with descriptive fields. No input/output operations, network interactions, or dynamic code execution are present. The only notable aspect is the permissive 'arbitrary_types_allowed' setting, which might allow unvalidated types but does not by itself introduce malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data model definition for API responses, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain attacks. It appears to be a standard implementation for structured API response handling.",
