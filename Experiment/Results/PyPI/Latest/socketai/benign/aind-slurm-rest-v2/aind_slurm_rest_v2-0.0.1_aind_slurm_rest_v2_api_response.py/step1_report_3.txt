  "purpose": "Define a generic API response data model for serialization and validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library, third-party library pydantic, type variable T for generic data type.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the class is a data container with no execution or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input into the model fields during instantiation; no malicious data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of arbitrary_types_allowed: True can potentially allow complex or unsafe types, but no specific malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic response model using pydantic for data validation. It imports standard and third-party modules safely. The class includes fields for status code, headers, data, and raw data, with appropriate type annotations. The model_config allows arbitrary types, which might be considered a flexibility concern but is not inherently malicious. No code execution, data leakage, or suspicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data model for API responses, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of arbitrary_types_allowed should be reviewed for safety but does not indicate malicious intent.",
