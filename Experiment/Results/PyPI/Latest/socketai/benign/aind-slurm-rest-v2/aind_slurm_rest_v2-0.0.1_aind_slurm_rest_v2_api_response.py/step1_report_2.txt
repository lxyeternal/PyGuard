  "purpose": "Define a generic API response data structure using Pydantic for data validation and serialization.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard and third-party libraries, including Pydantic and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling beyond standard data modeling; no execution or data processing functions present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external sources into the class fields via deserialization, but no dynamic execution or untrusted data processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' in model_config could permit complex or malicious types, but this alone is not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic data model for API responses using Pydantic, specifying status code, headers, data, and raw bytes. It employs type annotations and model configuration to allow arbitrary types, which is flexible but not inherently malicious. There are no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured data class for API responses without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data model for API responses, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' warrants cautious use but is not malicious by itself.",
