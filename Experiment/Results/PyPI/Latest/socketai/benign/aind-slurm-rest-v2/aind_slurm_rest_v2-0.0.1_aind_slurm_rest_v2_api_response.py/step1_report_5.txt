  "purpose": "Define a generic API response object for data serialization and validation.",
  "sources": "None (static code defining a class and imports).",
  "sinks": "None (no data processing, no external data handling or untrusted data flows).",
  "flows": "None (no runtime data flow; purely a class definition).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules (pydantic) to define a generic data model class 'ApiResponse'. The class includes fields for status code, headers, data, and raw data, with appropriate type annotations and validation constraints. The 'model_config' allows arbitrary types, which is a typical configuration for flexible data models. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external interactions are present. The code appears to be straightforward, well-structured, and intended for data modeling without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless definition of a generic API response data model using pydantic. No malicious intent, no security risks identified, and it does not perform any external operations or data manipulation that could be malicious.",
