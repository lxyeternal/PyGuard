{
  "purpose": "Defines a generic API response object for serializing HTTP responses with status, headers, data, and raw data.",
  "sources": "Input data for status_code, headers, data, raw_data fields",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted 'data' if external types are used, but no direct sinks present",
  "flows": "Input sources to data fields; no external data flow or processing observed",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed = True' allowing any type for 'data', which could be exploited if untrusted types are injected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Pydantic model with fields for status code, headers, data, and raw data. The permissive 'arbitrary_types_allowed' setting introduces a potential security concern if external code supplies malicious or untrusted types, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions, network activity, or data leaks. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The security risk is low but warrants caution in untrusted environments. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting the permissive configuration without active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API response data model with a minor configuration caveat regarding 'arbitrary_types_allowed'. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain attack. The low security risk score is appropriate, and malware remains at 0. The configuration should be reviewed if used with untrusted data sources, but overall, the code is safe.",
