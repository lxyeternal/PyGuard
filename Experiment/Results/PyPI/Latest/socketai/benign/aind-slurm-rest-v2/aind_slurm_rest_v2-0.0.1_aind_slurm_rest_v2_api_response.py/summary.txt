  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API response data model with a minor configuration caveat regarding 'arbitrary_types_allowed'. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain attack. The low security risk score is appropriate, and malware remains at 0. The configuration should be reviewed if used with untrusted data sources, but overall, the code is safe."
