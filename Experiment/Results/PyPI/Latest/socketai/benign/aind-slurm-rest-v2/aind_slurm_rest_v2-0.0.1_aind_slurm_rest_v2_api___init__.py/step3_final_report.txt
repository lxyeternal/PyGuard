  "purpose": "Import API classes for SLURM workload management system",
  "sources": "Import statements from aind_slurm_rest_v2.api.slurm_api and slurmdb_api modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "None; only static import statements without data flow or execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements for two classes from a package related to SLURM APIs, with a comment to suppress linter warnings. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The snippet does not perform any data processing, network activity, or code execution. The high confidence scores reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code. The lack of dynamic code, hardcoded secrets, or external interactions indicates minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, serving solely to import API classes. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1, reflecting very low risk due to its simplicity. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose security concerns.",
