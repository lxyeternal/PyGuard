  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, considering the code snippet and the assessments provided.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\n# flake8: noqa\n\n# import apis into api package\nfrom aind_slurm_rest_v2.api.slurm_api import SlurmApi\nfrom aind_slurm_rest_v2.api.slurmdb_api import SlurmdbApi\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that this code only contains import statements for two classes from a package related to SLURM APIs. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **No issues detected.**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly interpret the code as benign, standard import statements with no security concerns.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Mostly very low (0 or 0.1). This aligns with the absence of suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  Correctly 0, as the code is straightforward.\n\n### Risk Justification:\n- Since the code only imports classes and does not execute any code, connect to external systems, or handle untrusted data, the risk is minimal.\n- The only point of potential concern could be if these classes, when instantiated elsewhere, perform malicious actions. But from this snippet alone, there's no evidence of that.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize that import statements alone are not malicious.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but given the overall context, 0.1 is acceptable as a very low risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code snippet is a benign, standard import of API classes for a SLURM management system. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly because import statements can be used maliciously if combined with other code, but not here)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, and the scores should reflect minimal risk.",
