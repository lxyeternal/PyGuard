  "purpose": "This code imports specific API classes from a package related to slurm workload manager APIs, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the package 'aind_slurm_rest_v2.api' when importing modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports data from package modules into the namespace for use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements to include specific API classes. The presence of a 'noqa' comment indicates suppression of linter warnings, which is common in development. The modules imported appear to be standard API client classes, with no suspicious or malicious code detected within this snippet. There are no signs of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup or API client import.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving the purpose of importing API classes for further use. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet.",
