  "purpose": "Importing API classes from the aind_slurm_rest_v2 package for interacting with Slurm and Slurm database APIs.",
  "sources": "No direct data input sources present; only import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; only module imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports do not involve data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements for two API classes from a specific package. It includes a comment to disable flake8 checks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The imports suggest the code is part of a larger project that interacts with Slurm APIs, which is standard for system management scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import of API modules with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard boilerplate for a Python project that interacts with Slurm APIs.",
