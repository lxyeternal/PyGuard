  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a REST client with proxy, SSL, and request handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes potential data leaks but notes that data is handled in a controlled manner.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. Proxy URL handling is based on configuration input, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states that the code is a typical REST client with no malicious intent, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code does not contain any evidence of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities beyond standard configuration.  \n- The proxy URL validation is straightforward and based on configuration, not user input at runtime.  \n- The security risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable given the proxy handling and potential for misconfiguration, but no actual vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues found. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard REST client behavior, SSL, proxy, and request handling.\n- Confirms no suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets.\n- Confidence is even higher (1.0).\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malware or obfuscation issues.  \n- Proxy URL validation is standard.  \n- The security risk remains low, consistent with the report.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Reiterates the standard REST client implementation, with proper SSL and proxy handling.\n- No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.  \n- Proxy URL validation and SSL configuration are standard and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizes standard network request handling, SSL, proxies.\n- No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Proxy validation and SSL handling follow best practices.  \n- No suspicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Also confirms the code is a standard HTTP client with proper SSL and proxy configurations.\n- No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious network activity.  \n- Proxy handling is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is a standard, well-structured REST client.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** None identified; no logic errors or security flaws are evident.\n- **Scores Justification:** All malware scores are 0, obfuscated scores are 0, and security risks are low (~0.2), reflecting cautious but reasonable assessments.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only minor concern could be misconfiguration of proxies, but that is outside the code's control and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 remains reasonable, given the potential for misconfiguration but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports, considering proxy configuration and SSL handling)  \n\nThe code appears safe, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
