  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a REST client for Slurm API, reading SSL, proxy, and request configs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Handles request parameters, response wrapping.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no malicious code. Proxy URL handling is based on configuration input, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It’s a typical REST client.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low, as configuration-based, typical network client.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard HTTP client behavior with SSL and proxy support.\n- No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.0–0.2 (as per report).\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, a standard HTTP client with configurable SSL and proxy.\n- No malicious indicators, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar analysis; standard handling of requests, SSL, proxies.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion: well-structured, standard request handling, proxy differentiation, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence of malware or malicious behavior:** No.\n- **Obfuscation:** No.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly configuration and request handling.\n\n### Justification of scores:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns, primarily around configuration handling, which is standard.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — minor security concern due to configuration handling, but nothing alarming.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-implemented REST client with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
