  "purpose": "Data model for maximum CPU configuration in Slurm API responses.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; internal class attributes and fields.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON input to model validation and back to JSON serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data class with standard methods.",
  "analysis": "The code is a clear, standard Pydantic data model defining CPU constraints with serialization/deserialization methods. It contains no external system calls, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely data validation and transfer, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data model with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the analysis.",
