{
  "purpose": "This code is a collection of import statements for models, exceptions, and API classes related to the auto-generated SDK for the Slurm REST API. It sets up dependencies required for SDK functionality.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from various modules within the 'aind_slurm_rest_v2' package.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output data, nor does it perform any runtime actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static import declarations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no obfuscation, no embedded secrets, and no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for models, exceptions, and API classes. There is no dynamic code, no data processing, no external input/output, and no embedded secrets or obfuscation. The structure indicates it is an auto-generated SDK setup file intended for API interaction. Given the static nature and lack of executable logic, there are no security risks or malicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, auto-generated SDK dependency setup file with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The code is purely structural, serving as dependency imports for API client functionality.",
