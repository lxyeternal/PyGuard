  "purpose": "This code imports and organizes modules, models, and exceptions related to the Slurm REST API client SDK, primarily for use in API interactions and data handling.",
  "sources": "Imports of external modules, models, and exceptions from the 'aind_slurm_rest_v2' package. No input or data reading code present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or execution points where untrusted data is processed or where data could leak; this is purely import statements and setup.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow since the code only consists of imports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward, consisting of standard import statements and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements for various models and exceptions within a specific SDK package related to Slurm API. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution present. The comments and structure are consistent with standard SDK setup files. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are observed. It appears to be a legitimate SDK module initialization file with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import and setup script for a Slurm REST API SDK. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
