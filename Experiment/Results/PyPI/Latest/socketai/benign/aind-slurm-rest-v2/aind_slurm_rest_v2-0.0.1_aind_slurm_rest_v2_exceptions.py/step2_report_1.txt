  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's functionality, potential vulnerabilities, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes and error handling for an OpenAPI client, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard error handling, decoding response data, and generating error messages. No suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (negligible).\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code's nature. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard exception classes and error processing.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The code is purely for error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Consistent with the code. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, exception classes and utility functions for error reporting.\n- **Assessment:** The code involves decoding response data and raising exceptions based on status codes, typical for API clients. No malicious logic or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate assessment; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes, handles errors based on HTTP response.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code, no network activity, no obfuscation. The decoding of response data is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct; the code is standard error handling.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with structured error handling and response parsing.\n- **Assessment:** Uses 'http_resp' to decode response data and raise exceptions. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low).\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate scoring; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1 or 0), as the code is standard error handling for an API client, with no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n- The code is secure, non-malicious, and well-structured for its intended purpose.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (negligible, standard error handling)\n\n**Summary:** The code is purely for structured error handling in an API client, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
