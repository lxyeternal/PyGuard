{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes and error handling for the Slurm REST API client, processing HTTP responses and generating detailed error messages.",
  "sources": "HTTP response data (http_resp.data), error message strings, response headers via http_resp.getheaders()",
  "sinks": "Error message strings constructed for exceptions, decoding of response data for error reporting",
  "flows": "Decoding http_resp.data -> constructing error message -> raising specific exceptions based on http_resp.status",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected; standard error handling logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes for API error handling, decodes response data for error messages, and raises exceptions based on HTTP status codes. It uses standard practices for error reporting, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The decoding of response data is typical in error handling modules. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured error handling module for an API client, with no malicious or obfuscated features. The low security risk score is justified. No modifications are necessary.",
