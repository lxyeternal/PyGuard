{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and utility functions for handling errors and responses from an OpenAPI client interacting with a Slurm REST API.",
  "sources": "Input data includes HTTP response objects (http_resp), error messages (msg), and optional data or body parameters provided during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Error messages and response data are stored in class attributes and included in exception messages; no data is directly written or transmitted by this code.",
  "flows": "Errors are raised and propagated based on HTTP response status; no external data flows or network operations are performed within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be standard exception handling logic for an API client.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom exception classes for various HTTP error statuses and a utility to render error paths. It decodes HTTP response data when provided. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The implementation focuses solely on error representation and handling, with no network, data collection, or external communication functions. No obfuscation or suspicious code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard API exception handling logic with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is designed to manage and format error responses in a typical API client manner.",
