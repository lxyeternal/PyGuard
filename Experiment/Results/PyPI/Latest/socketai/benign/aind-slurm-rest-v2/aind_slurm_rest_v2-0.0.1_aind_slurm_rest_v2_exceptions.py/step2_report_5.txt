  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes and error handling for an OpenAPI client, with no malicious or suspicious activity. It processes HTTP responses, raises exceptions, and formats error messages.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, obfuscation, or malware. The data flows are standard, involving decoding response data and constructing error messages.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code is purely for error handling.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion is justified. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a standard exception hierarchy with no malicious intent.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code patterns or data leaks. The code is straightforward.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, consistent with the description.\n- **Assessment:** Valid conclusion. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is standard error handling for an API client, decoding response data for error messages.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The decoding of response data is typical.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** The code manages errors based on HTTP response status, with no suspicious features.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behaviors or suspicious patterns. The use of response data decoding is standard.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, matching the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** Justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on structured error handling with no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** The use of 'http_resp' object and decoding are standard; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, **Malware Score:** 0.** \n  - The slight risk score reflects the potential concern about decoding response data, but this is a normal operation in error handling.\n- **Assessment:** Given the standard nature of the code, a risk score of 0.1 seems slightly conservative but acceptable. The malware score remains 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** All reports correctly identify that the code is solely for structured error handling in an API client. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both are zero across all reports, which is accurate.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero in the last report (0.1), justified by the decoding of response data, but this is standard and not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain low, around 0.0 to 0.1, as the code is purely for error handling and does not pose security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-reasoned. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise is present in this code. The minor risk score in the last report is justified but could be slightly lowered to 0.0, considering the benign nature of the operations.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports  \n- **Risk:** 0.0–0.1, with the last being acceptable at 0.1 due to decoding operations but still safe.",
