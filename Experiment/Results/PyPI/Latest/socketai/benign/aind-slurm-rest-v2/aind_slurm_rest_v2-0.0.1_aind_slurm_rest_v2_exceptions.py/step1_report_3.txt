{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling errors in an OpenAPI client, along with utility functions for error messaging and response processing.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include HTTP response objects and optional strings or data passed during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe sinks involve decoding HTTP response data, which could be malicious if the response body is crafted maliciously, but this is standard behavior for error reporting.",
  "flows": "Error handling flow involves capturing HTTP response status and data, then raising specific exceptions based on status codes; data from responses is processed for error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are evident; the code appears to be standard error handling for API responses, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured exception hierarchy for API errors, including specific exceptions for common HTTP errors like 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 422, and server errors. It includes a utility function to render error paths and a method to construct detailed error messages. The use of decoding response data for error reporting is typical and safe in this context. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose aligns with error handling in API clients and does not exhibit any malicious intent or supply chain risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of API error handling classes and utility functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to manage and report errors from HTTP responses in a structured manner.",
