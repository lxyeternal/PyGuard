{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling errors in an OpenAPI-based API client, providing structured error reporting and response parsing.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the code processes HTTP responses and error messages internally.",
  "sinks": "Error messages and response data are stored in exception objects; no evident data sinks for untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "HTTP response objects are used to generate detailed exception messages based on status codes; no untrusted data flows into critical system components.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected. The code is purely structural for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of exception class definitions and a helper function for rendering error paths. It handles HTTP response errors, raising specific exceptions based on status codes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. All functionality appears to be for error handling in a client library. The code is well-structured and does not include obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of exception classes and helper functions for an API client, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages error reporting and response parsing, with no suspicious activity.",
