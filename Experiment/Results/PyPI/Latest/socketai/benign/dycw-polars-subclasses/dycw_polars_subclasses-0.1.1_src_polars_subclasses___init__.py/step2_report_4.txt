  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the corresponding reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content:**\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\n__version__ = \"0.1.1\"\n```\nThis code is minimal, consisting only of a future import for annotations and a version string assignment.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- They correctly identify that there are no data sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies.\n- The use of `__future__` import is standard for compatibility and does not introduce security risks.\n- The version string is a common practice for package versioning.\n\n3. **Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The confidence level is 1, which is justified.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code is purely boilerplate or metadata setup.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a harmless, standard module header with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
