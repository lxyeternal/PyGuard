  "purpose": "Defines a future import for annotations and sets the package version.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading occurs in this snippet).",
  "sinks": "None (no data or untrusted input processed).",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __future__ import is normal, but no other code present; the version string is harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a __future__ import statement and a version string assignment. There are no functions, data inputs, outputs, or logic that could be malicious. The __future__ import is standard for compatibility and does not pose any security risks. The version string is a benign variable assignment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, benign code snippet with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger module, but on its own, it is safe.",
