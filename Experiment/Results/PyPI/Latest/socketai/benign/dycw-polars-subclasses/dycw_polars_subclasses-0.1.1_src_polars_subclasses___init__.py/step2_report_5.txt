  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code snippet:\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\n__version__ = \"0.1.1\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code contains only a future import and a version string declaration. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows.  \n  **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious code are present.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n\n- **Logical correctness:**  \n  The reports consistently state that the code is benign, standard, and minimal.  \n  **No errors or flaws detected** in their reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\n- **Are these reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The code is trivial and standard, with no suspicious patterns. The high confidence score is justified given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n\n- The reports assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores of 0, which is appropriate.  \n- No higher scores are warranted because there's no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Reflection**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.  \n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- The reports do not rely on unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Score Consistency**\n\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies observed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the code's trivial and benign nature, a risk score of **0** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Recommended Value | Justification                                                      |\n|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware           | 0                   | No malicious behavior detected.                                      |\n| obfuscated        | 0                   | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.                    |\n| securityRisk      | 0                   | No security risks identified in the minimal code snippet.          |\n\n---\n\n### **Final note:**\n\nThis code snippet is a minimal, benign module header typical in Python projects. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The current scores are appropriate and should be maintained.\n\n**End of review.**",
