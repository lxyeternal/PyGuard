  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the provided code.\n\n**Code Review:**\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\n__version__ = \"0.1.1\"\n```\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code only contains a `__future__` import and a version string assignment.\n- No data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- No functions, dynamic code, or external interactions.\n- The code is minimal and standard for Python modules, especially to enable forward compatibility of annotations.\n- No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Correctly states that the code is benign, with no suspicious elements.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also correctly identifies the code as standard, benign, and without suspicious patterns.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: benign, standard setup, no malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same reasoning: minimal, benign, no suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also correct: code is harmless, no security issues.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (all zeros for malware, obfuscated, and risk) are appropriate and justified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since the code does not pose any security threat.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- Given the simplicity of the code, there is no need to adjust scores.\n- If future code snippets contain more complex logic, these scores should be re-evaluated accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and poses no security risk.",
