  "purpose": "Minimal Python module snippet with a future import and version string, serving as a benign module header or metadata.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only static import and string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static code with no dynamic execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a feature for forward compatibility and defines a version string. It contains no functions, data processing, or dynamic behaviors. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and safety of the code. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard module header with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
