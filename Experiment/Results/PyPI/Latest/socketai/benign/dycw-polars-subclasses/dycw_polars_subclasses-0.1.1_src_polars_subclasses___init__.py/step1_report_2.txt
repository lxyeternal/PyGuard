  "purpose": "The code sets the future import for annotations and defines a version string, likely part of a larger module or package.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs, especially untrusted data handling, are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are observed.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only imports and a version string; no unusual or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations feature for forward compatibility and defines a version string, which is standard practice in Python modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The snippet is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is safe and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears to be a normal part of a larger, benign Python project.",
