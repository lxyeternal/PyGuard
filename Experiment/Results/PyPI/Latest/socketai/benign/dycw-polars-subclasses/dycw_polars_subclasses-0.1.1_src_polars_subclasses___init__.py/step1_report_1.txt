  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for future annotations and a version string declaration. There are no data inputs, no data manipulation, and no logic that could be malicious. The use of __future__ import is standard for forward compatibility. The version string is a common practice to indicate the package version. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard module initialization with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
