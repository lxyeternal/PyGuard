  "purpose": "Define the future annotations feature for compatibility and set package version",
  "sources": "Import statement from __future__ module, version string assignment",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sources involved",
  "flows": "No data flow between sources and sinks; code primarily sets up environment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; minimal code with standard syntax",
  "analysis": "The code imports a feature from __future__ to ensure compatibility of annotations in Python and sets a version string. No input/output operations, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be a typical module header with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard setup for a Python package. No malicious behavior, anomalies, or security issues are detected.",
