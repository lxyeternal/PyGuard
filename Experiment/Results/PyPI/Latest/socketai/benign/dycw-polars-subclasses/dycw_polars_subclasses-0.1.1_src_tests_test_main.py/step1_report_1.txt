  "flows": "Import of __version__ (source) used in type assertion within test_main()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from an external module and asserts its type. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The only import is from a presumably open-source module, and the test function only performs a simple type check.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test function verifying the type of a version string imported from an external package. No malicious behavior or security issues are present.",
