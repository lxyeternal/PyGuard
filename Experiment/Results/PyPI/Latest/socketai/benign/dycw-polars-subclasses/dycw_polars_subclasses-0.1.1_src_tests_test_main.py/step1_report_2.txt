{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple test function that verifies the type of a version string imported from a module.",
  "sources": "Import statement for __version__ from polars_subclasses",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing, output, or external communication occurs",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected; import from a non-standard module is typical for version info",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version variable and tests if it is a string, which is a standard practice. The test function is straightforward and does not perform any network, file, or system operations. No malicious behavior or malicious code patterns are evident. The import from 'polars_subclasses' is not inherently suspicious; it is a package likely related to the Polars data library. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple assertion to verify the type of a version string. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
