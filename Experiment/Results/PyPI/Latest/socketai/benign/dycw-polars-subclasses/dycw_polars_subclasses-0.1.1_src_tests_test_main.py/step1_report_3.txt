  "purpose": "The code imports a version string from a module named polars_subclasses and tests if it is a string.",
  "sources": "Import statement for __version__ from polars_subclasses; no input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is used in a vulnerable manner.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply performs a type check on an imported value.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The import of __version__ is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a basic import and a unit test to verify __version__ is a string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. It appears to be a simple, benign test script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test to verify the __version__ string from an external module. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies.",
