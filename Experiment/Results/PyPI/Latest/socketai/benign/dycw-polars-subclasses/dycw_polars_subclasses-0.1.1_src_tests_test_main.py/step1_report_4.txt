{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple test function to verify that __version__ imported from polars_subclasses is a string.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ variable from the polars_subclasses module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "The source (__version__ variable) is checked with isinstance, which is a benign operation and does not propagate data or cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. It imports a version string and tests its type.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __version__ from polars_subclasses, then asserts that __version__ is a string in the test_main() function. There are no indications of malicious intent, no data leaks, and no unsafe operations. The code is straightforward and appears to be a simple unit test. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test checking the type of a version string. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
