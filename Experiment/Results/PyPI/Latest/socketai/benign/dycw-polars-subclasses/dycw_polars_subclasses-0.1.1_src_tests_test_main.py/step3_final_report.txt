  "purpose": "A simple unit test verifying that the imported '__version__' from 'polars_subclasses' is a string.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing '__version__' from 'polars_subclasses'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "Import of '__version__' followed by a type assertion; no data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string and asserts its type, with no malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious patterns. It performs a benign check typical of unit tests. No external data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, straightforward test verifying the type of an imported version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
