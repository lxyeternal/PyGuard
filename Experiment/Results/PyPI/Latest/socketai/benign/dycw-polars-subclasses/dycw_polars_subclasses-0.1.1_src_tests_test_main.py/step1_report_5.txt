  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple test function verifying the type of the '__version__' variable imported from 'polars_subclasses'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'polars_subclasses' module and the '__version__' variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow targets are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The '__version__' value is imported and checked for its type, with no data flow beyond that.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version variable from a module and asserts that it is a string, which is standard practice for versioning. There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign test function verifying the type of a version string. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
