  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:\n   - The code consists solely of importing `__version__` from `polars_subclasses` and asserting its type is `str`.\n   - No code execution beyond this import and assertion.\n   - No evidence of code obfuscation, malicious constructs, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are present.\n   - The code is minimal and appropriate for a simple unit test.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all at 1, which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Justification**:\n   - Since the code performs only a benign import and type assertion, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - Malware score is correctly 0; no malicious activity is detected or implied.\n   - The code does not involve external data handling, network operations, or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - The import from `polars_subclasses` is standard and not suspicious.\n\n6. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the code's simplicity and the reports' consensus, I agree with the current scoring. The code is a benign unit test with no security concerns.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
