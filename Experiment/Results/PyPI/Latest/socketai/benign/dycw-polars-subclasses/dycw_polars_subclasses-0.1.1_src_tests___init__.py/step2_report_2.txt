  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippets carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:  \nAll reports describe the same minimal code snippet:  \n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n```  \nThis is a standard import statement used in Python 3.7+ to enable postponed evaluation of annotations.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n- The code itself is benign and does not contain any logic, data handling, or output.  \n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or signs of obfuscation are present.  \n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or flows are involved.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their description.  \n- They correctly identify that this is a simple, standard import statement with no malicious intent.  \n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n4. **Score Review and Justification**:  \n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- Confidence scores are 1.0, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.  \n- The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Malicious Behavior**:  \n- No suspicious activity, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration, is suggested or implied.  \n- The use of `__future__` imports is common and safe, serving compatibility purposes.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n- All claims are grounded in the code snippet's simplicity and standard practice.  \n- No unwarranted assumptions are made about hidden malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.  \n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct)  \n\n**Overall, the code is a harmless, standard Python import statement for future annotations. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates after review:\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0  \n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's benign nature.",
