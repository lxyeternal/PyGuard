  "purpose": "This code snippet imports future annotations feature in Python for forward compatibility and type hinting.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement itself, which reads the __future__ module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as this is only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, but the use of __future__ import suggests preparation for advanced type hinting. No anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a feature from __future__, which is a standard practice in Python 3.x for compatibility purposes. It does not include any input, data processing, or output. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code snippet is benign and common in Python projects aiming for compatibility between Python versions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless import statement used for future compatibility. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this minimal snippet.",
