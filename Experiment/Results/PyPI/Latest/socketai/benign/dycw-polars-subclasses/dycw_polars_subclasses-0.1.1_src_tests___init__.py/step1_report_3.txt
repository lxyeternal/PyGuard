  "purpose": "This code imports annotations for forward references, which is a feature used to postpone evaluation of annotations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only contains an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single import statement with no additional context, which is not unusual or suspicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the annotations feature from __future__, which is a standard practice in Python 3.7+ to enable postponed evaluation of annotations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no data input, no data leakage, and no suspicious operations. Since this is only a fragment with a single import statement, it provides no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This minimal code snippet is a standard import statement used to enable future Python features. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security concerns in this code fragment.",
