  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe a single import statement: `from __future__ import annotations`.\n   - The code snippet is minimal, with no data flow, input, output, or complex logic.\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their description.\n   - They correctly identify the import as benign and standard practice.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The analysis appropriately dismisses any suspicion, given the simplicity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1.0 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is a simple import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior, a `securityRisk` of 0 is appropriate.\n   - The `malware` score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - No reason to elevate scores beyond 0 given the evidence.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious action, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, focusing solely on the code snippet.\n   - They correctly interpret the import as standard practice without implying malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - Given the minimal and benign nature of the code, scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code snippet is a standard, benign Python import statement used for compatibility purposes. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and best practices in supply chain security review.",
