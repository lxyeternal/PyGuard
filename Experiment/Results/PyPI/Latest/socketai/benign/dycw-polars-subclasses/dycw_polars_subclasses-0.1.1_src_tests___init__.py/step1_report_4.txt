{
  "purpose": "The code is an import statement for annotations from the future module, which allows using features from newer Python versions in older ones.",
  "sources": "The code reads the source code itself during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only contains an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the use of __future__ import is standard for compatibility and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'annotations' feature from the __future__ module, enabling postponed evaluation of annotations. This is a common practice for forward compatibility in Python 3.7+ and does not involve any untrusted input, data leakage, or malicious behavior. No other code, functions, or logic are present to analyze further. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple, standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks.",
