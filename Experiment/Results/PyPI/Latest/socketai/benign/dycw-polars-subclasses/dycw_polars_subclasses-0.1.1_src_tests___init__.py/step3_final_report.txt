  "purpose": "Import statement to enable postponed evaluation of annotations in Python 3.7+",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs involved",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process or output data",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code is a static import with no runtime data movement",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward, standard import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, benign import statement used for enabling postponed evaluation of annotations. It does not involve data processing, user input, network activity, or any other behavior that could be malicious. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with full confidence. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code aligns with standard Python practices and poses no threat in supply chain security context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python import statement with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's harmless nature.",
