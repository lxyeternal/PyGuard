  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports describe the same minimal code snippet:  \n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n```  \nThis is a standard Python import statement used to enable postponed evaluation of annotations, introduced in Python 3.7+. It is a benign, well-understood practice for compatibility and type hinting purposes.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n- The code itself contains no malicious logic, data processing, or data flow.  \n- No suspicious or anomalous behavior is evident.  \n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present.  \n- The code is syntactically correct and aligns with standard practices.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in describing the benign nature of the code.  \n- They correctly identify that this snippet is only an import statement with no data flow or malicious intent.  \n- No errors or logical flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the absence of any suspicious activity.  \n- The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk and Malware Scores**  \n- Since the code is a simple import statement with no data handling, no vulnerabilities, and no malicious behavior, the risk score should remain at 0.  \n- The malware score should also be 0, as there's no indication of malicious intent or payloads.  \n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n\n6. **Potential Assumptions and Claims**  \n- All claims about benignity are well-founded; no assumptions are made beyond the code snippet.  \n- The reports do not overstate or understate the risk; they correctly identify this as a standard, harmless practice.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment**  \n- The code is entirely benign.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.  \n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's harmless nature and the absence of any malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code snippet is a standard, safe practice with no security concerns.",
