  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: `from __future__ import annotations`.\n- The code is a straightforward import statement, used to enable postponed evaluation of annotations in Python 3.7+.\n- No data processing, input/output, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1.0, obfuscated score 0, malware 0, and security risk 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Issue Presence\n- **Issue presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code only imports a feature from `__future__` and contains no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Code correctness:** The code snippet is accurate and standard for Python projects requiring compatibility with newer syntax features.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes\n- **No flaws detected:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and do not contain logical errors. They correctly state that this is benign, standard practice, and pose no security risk.\n\n### Scores Evaluation\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Appropriate, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity is indicated or implied.\n- **Security risk (0):** Justified, minimal code with no security implications.\n- **Confidence (1.0):** Justified, the analysis is accurate and complete.\n\n### Specific Points:\n- The reports do not overstate or understate any risks.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- The risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential Improvements:\n- No changes needed; the assessments are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Evaluation\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I concur with the reports' scores. However, for completeness:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless import statement.\n- The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly assess the minimal, benign nature of this code snippet. The overall security risk remains negligible, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
