{
  "purpose": "This code imports annotations from the __future__ module to enable future Python syntax features.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the __future__ import statement at the start of the module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present as there is no executable code or data handling beyond the import.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present as the code only performs an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single import statement, which is standard and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, valid import statement for future annotations support. It does not perform any data input, processing, or output. The import is standard and benign, intended to modify language behavior for type hinting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, contains no malicious behavior, and is a typical use of __future__ imports for compatibility with future Python syntax. No security risks identified.",
