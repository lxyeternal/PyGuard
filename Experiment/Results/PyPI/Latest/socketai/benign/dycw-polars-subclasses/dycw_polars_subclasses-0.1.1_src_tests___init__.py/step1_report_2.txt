  "purpose": "This code imports annotations from __future__, which allows the use of postponed evaluation of annotations for compatibility with older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statement from __future__",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing occurs in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and consists solely of a future import, which is benign and standard practice for compatibility; no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a feature from the __future__ module, which is a common and safe operation used to enable newer Python features in older versions. There are no additional code components, input handling, or data processing present. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, minimal code snippet that imports a __future__ feature to improve compatibility. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
