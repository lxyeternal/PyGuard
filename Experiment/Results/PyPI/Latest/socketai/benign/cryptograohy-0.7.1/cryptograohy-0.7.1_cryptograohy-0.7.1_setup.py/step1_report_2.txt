  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'cryptograohy', including package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Code reads package information, author details, dependencies, and entry point script.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code defines installation behavior and entry points but does not execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow; package metadata flows into installation process, but no suspicious data manipulation is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical errors in package name ('cryptograohy' instead of 'cryptography') may indicate obfuscation or negligence, but no malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or obfuscated constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools, defining package info, dependencies, and CLI entry point. The package name appears misspelled but does not imply malicious intent. No suspicious code, data leaks, or security risks are present. No obfuscation or malware indicators are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with a minor typo in the package name. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
