  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata and installation configuration for a Python package named 'cryptograohy', including dependencies and CLI entry points.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including package name, version, author info, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script is static configuration data without data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'cryptograohy' is misspelled, which could be an attempt at typosquatting or deception.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with no dynamic or obfuscated code. The only suspicious aspect is the misspelling of 'cryptography' as 'cryptograohy'. All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the security risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), mainly due to the potential for deception via the typo. The confidence in these assessments is high, as the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the misspelled package name, which could be used for impersonation or typosquatting, but this does not reflect malicious code within the package itself. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary.",
