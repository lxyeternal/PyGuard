The misspelling of 'cryptograohy' might indicate a typo or a potential phishing package, but this alone does not constitute malicious code. There are no sources of untrusted data, no external code execution, and no hidden backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms. The setup appears typical for Python package distribution.",
