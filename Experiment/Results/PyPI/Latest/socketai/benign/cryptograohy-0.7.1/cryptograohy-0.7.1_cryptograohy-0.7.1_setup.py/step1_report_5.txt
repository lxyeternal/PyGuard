{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'cryptograohy'. It specifies metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "The entire script, specifically the 'setup' function call, reads static data such as package name, version, author info, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the script does not process untrusted input or write sensitive data during runtime. It only defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration data flows from static definitions into the package installation process, with no dynamic data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in package name ('cryptograohy' instead of 'cryptography') is notable but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools, with typical package metadata and dependency declarations. No dynamic or obfuscated code, no external inputs, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The only noteworthy aspect is a possible typo in the package name. No signs of malware or malicious behavior detected.",
