{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point for a CLI application, importing and executing the 'cli' function upon module load.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'cli' from a local module; immediate call to 'cli()'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'cli()' which may process input or perform actions; actual behavior depends on 'cli()' implementation.",
  "flows": "Import of 'cli' -> invocation of 'cli()' function; potential internal source-to-sink flow within 'cli()' not visible here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and call pattern; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing 'cli' and executing it immediately. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The actual behavior of 'cli()' is unknown, so no definitive security assessment can be made beyond the visible pattern. The pattern is typical for CLI tools, and the code itself is benign. Scores assigned in the reports reflect this, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and low risk scores around 0.1, which are appropriate given the simplicity and standard pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI entry point with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The current scores are justified and should remain as they are unless further internal details of 'cli()' reveal malicious activity.",
