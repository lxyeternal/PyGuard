  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing and executing the CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'cli' from the local 'cli' module.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'cli()' function, which may process command-line input and potentially perform actions based on user input.",
  "flows": "Import of 'cli' → call to 'cli()' function during module initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'cli' function from a local module and immediately invokes it when the package is imported. This pattern is typical for command-line tools to run their interface upon module load. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects beyond standard CLI invocation. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no apparent security issues or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an entry point for a CLI application, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply executes the CLI when the package is imported, which is typical for CLI tools.",
