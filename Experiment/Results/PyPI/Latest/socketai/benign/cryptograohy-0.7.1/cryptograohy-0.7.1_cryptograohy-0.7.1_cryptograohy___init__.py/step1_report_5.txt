  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by invoking the CLI command.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'cli' from the local module '.cli'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'cli()' function, which likely starts the command-line interface.",
  "flows": "Import -> Function call 'cli()' upon module initialization.",
  "anomalies": "The code simply imports and calls a function without any suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or external data sources are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'cli' function from a local module and immediately executes it. This is typical for CLI tools to start interaction when the module is run. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code behavior. No external network activity, no backdoors, and no data handling beyond starting the CLI are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard initialization script for a CLI application. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
