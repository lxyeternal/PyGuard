  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package and invoke the command-line interface (CLI).",
  "sources": "Importing the 'cli' function from the local 'cli' module.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'cli()' function which likely starts a command-line interface process.",
  "flows": "Import of 'cli' -> invocation of 'cli()' function, which may handle user input or execute commands.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports the 'cli' function from a local module and executes it. This is a standard pattern for CLI applications. No embedded malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious network activity is evident. Since the actual implementation of 'cli()' is not provided, we cannot determine its internal behavior, but the invocation alone is not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as an entry point for a CLI application, with no apparent malicious intent or security issues based on the provided snippet.",
