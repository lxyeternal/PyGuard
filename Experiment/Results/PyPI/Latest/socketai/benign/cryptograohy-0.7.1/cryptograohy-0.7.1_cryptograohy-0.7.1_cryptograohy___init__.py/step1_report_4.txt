  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by invoking the command-line interface (CLI).",
  "sources": "Import statement from .cli module, and the subsequent call to cli() function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of cli() function; potential user input handling within cli() if not shown here.",
  "flows": "Import from .cli → call cli() function, which may process user input or command-line arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a CLI function from a relative module and immediately executes it. This is typical for command-line tools to start processing upon import. There are no evident data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious activity in this snippet. As the core logic resides in the cli() function (not shown), no malicious behavior can be inferred solely from this fragment. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to initialize and run a CLI for the asciidrawing package. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet. It appears to be standard package entry point code.",
