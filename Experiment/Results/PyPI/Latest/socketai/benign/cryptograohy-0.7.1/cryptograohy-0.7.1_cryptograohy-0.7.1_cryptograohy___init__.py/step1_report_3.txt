  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by invoking the CLI command when imported.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .cli module and the call to cli() function.",
  "sinks": "The cli() function call could execute code that interacts with the system or user input.",
  "flows": "Import .cli module -> call cli() function which may process user input or execute commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; straightforward initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'cli' object from the local .cli module and immediately executes it. This pattern suggests that when the package is imported, it runs a command-line interface, likely prompting user interaction or executing a command. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior in this snippet. The security implications depend on the implementation of 'cli()' in the .cli module, which is not provided here. Given only this code, the behavior appears to be a standard package initialization routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import and immediate invocation of a CLI function. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this fragment. The pattern is typical for CLI tools that execute upon import, which could be considered a design concern but not inherently malicious.",
