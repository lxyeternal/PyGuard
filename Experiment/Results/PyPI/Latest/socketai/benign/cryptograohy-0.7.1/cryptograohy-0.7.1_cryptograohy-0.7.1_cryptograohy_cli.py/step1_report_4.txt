  "purpose": "Attempting to import a third-party library and create an EmojiConverter object, with error logging to a file.",
  "sources": "Import statement for pyprettifier, and reading error information from ImportError exception.",
  "sinks": "Writing error details to '/tmp/a' file.",
  "flows": "Import attempt (source) leads to exception handling (sink) which writes to a file.",
  "anomalies": "The code writes error details to a file in /tmp, but this is a common debugging practice; no malicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import 'pyprettifier' and instantiate an EmojiConverter object. If the library is missing, it catches ImportError and logs the error message into '/tmp/a'. The write operation is straightforward and does not involve untrusted input or network activity. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is minimal, with no obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not contain malicious intent. It appears to be a benign CLI utility that logs import errors. No evidence of malware or security risks present.",
