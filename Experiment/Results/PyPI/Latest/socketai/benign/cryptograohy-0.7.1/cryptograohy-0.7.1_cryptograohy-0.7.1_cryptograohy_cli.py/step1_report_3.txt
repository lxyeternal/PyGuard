  "sinks": "Writing to /tmp/a file when ImportError occurs",
  "flows": "If import fails, exception message is written to /tmp/a; otherwise, the conversion proceeds without further data flow",
  "anomalies": "The code writes error messages to a temporary file, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior detected. No use of untrusted input beyond exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import a third-party library and instantiate an object from it. If the library is missing, it logs the error message to a file in /tmp. This is a standard exception handling pattern. No data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious activity are evident. The file write operation is benign and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple library import with error logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
