  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the logical consistency of the findings, the presence of any malicious indicators, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured integration module for MI Data Flow, handling credentials, SSL, and network requests securely.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. The low security risk score reflects standard network and credential handling. The high confidence score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing secure data parsing, credential handling, and API interactions. No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.95.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code’s behavior. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The high confidence is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on standard data parsing, credential management, and API communication. No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies the code as legitimate, with standard handling of credentials and network requests. No suspicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Again, the code manages workflow data, credentials, and API requests securely. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is solid. The network activity is typical for such integrations, and no malicious indicators are present.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar findings—standard parsing, credential handling, and API communication. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The evaluation aligns with the code’s functionality.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2), reflecting typical security considerations for network and credential handling, which is justified given the context.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9–0.95), justified by thorough reasoning and consistent findings.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent, reasonable, and justified.\n- No modifications are necessary based on the provided analysis.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, secure integration module for MI Data Flow, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with reports)  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed reasoning above.",
