{
  "purpose": "The code provides a secure, structured interface for integrating Python scripts with MI Data Flow and Granta MI servers, handling payload parsing, URL management, SSL configuration, and authentication to facilitate workflow control and API interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from sys.stdin (JSON payload), extracts URL components, credentials from headers, and configuration parameters such as SSL certificates and authentication modes.",
  "sinks": "Network requests made via requests.post to the MI Data Flow API endpoint, transmitting workflow control data and credentials; decoding of authorization headers for credentials; potential use of SSL certificates for secure communication.",
  "flows": "Input payload from stdin → parsing JSON data → extracting URL and credentials → configuring SSL and authentication → making POST requests to resume workflows with appropriate headers and SSL verification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity; optional imports are handled safely; credentials are decoded only as needed for authentication.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation for MI Data Flow integration, managing credentials securely, handling SSL configurations appropriately, and performing API calls to control workflow execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The logic is consistent, with proper error handling and clear separation of concerns. The network interactions are typical for such integrations, and no suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and transparent integration module for MI Data Flow and Granta MI, with no indicators of supply chain attack, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), all consistent with the detailed analysis.",
