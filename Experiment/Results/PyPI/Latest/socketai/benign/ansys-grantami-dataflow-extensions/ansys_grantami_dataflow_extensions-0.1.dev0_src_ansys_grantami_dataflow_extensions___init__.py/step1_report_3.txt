{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that exports classes and exceptions related to data flow extensions, with version metadata.",
  "sources": "importlib_metadata.version(__name__.replace('.', '-'))",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data outputs or network interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; version retrieval is static and from standard library.",
  "anomalies": "The use of importlib_metadata to obtain the package version is standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library to get package version info, exports two classes/exceptions, and includes licensing comments. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. All actions appear benign and consistent with a typical Python package module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manages exports and version info, with no anomalous or malicious elements.",
