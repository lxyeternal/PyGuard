{
  "purpose": "Provides version information and exports for the Granta MI Data Flow Extensions, including importing metadata and defining public API elements.",
  "sources": "importlib_metadata.version(__name__.replace('.', '-')) retrieves version info; import statements import modules and classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands are present.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is retrieving package version metadata, which is a controlled operation and not user input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The version retrieval uses a dynamic string replacement but is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines public exports, and dynamically retrieves its version number based on package metadata. The version string is obtained via importlib_metadata.version, which is safe. No external network calls, no untrusted input, and no suspicious logic are present. The license and comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package module that exposes specific classes and version info without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and trustworthy.",
