{
  "purpose": "This module appears to provide data flow extensions for Granta MI, likely to be used in data management or processing workflows.",
  "sources": "Import of importlib.metadata to retrieve version information; import of local module '_mi_dataflow' for integration and exception classes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output, network operations, or other potentially unsafe sinks.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules, setting version info, and exposing certain classes; no untrusted data input or processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The use of importlib_metadata to dynamically retrieve version information based on the package name; no other suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of license notices, imports, and module exports. It imports standard library 'importlib.metadata' to get version info dynamically, and imports classes from a local module. There are no data inputs, network operations, or execution of code based on external data. The overall structure appears typical for a Python package's __init__.py or similar setup file. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious functions or behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign module setup for a Python package, containing license information, imports, and exports. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
