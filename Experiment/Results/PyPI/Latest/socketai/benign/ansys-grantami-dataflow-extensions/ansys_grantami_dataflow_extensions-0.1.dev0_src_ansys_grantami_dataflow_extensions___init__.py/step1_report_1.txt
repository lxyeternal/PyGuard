{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a package initialization file that imports specific classes and exceptions related to 'Granta MI Data Flow Extensions'. It sets the module's version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads importlib_metadata to get version info, and imports classes from a relative module '_mi_dataflow'. It also reads the module's name for version extraction.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data, user input, or network connections.",
  "flows": "The only data flow involves reading the package version and importing classes, which are static operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The version extraction method is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer, setting up exports and versioning. It imports metadata for version info and exposes classes related to data flow extensions. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The license and copyright comments are standard and do not influence security.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a package interface setup. No malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks identified.",
