{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a module for Granta MI Data Flow extensions, including importing specific classes and defining module metadata.",
  "sources": "importlib_metadata.version(__name__.replace('.', '-'))",
  "sinks": "The version string obtained from importlib_metadata could potentially be used in logging or output, but no direct sink of untrusted data is evident.",
  "flows": "The version information flows from importlib_metadata into __version__, with no further processing or output indicated.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns detected. The SPDX license and copyright statements are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles metadata and module imports. It imports importlib.metadata to dynamically retrieve the package version, which is standard. The only potentially sensitive part is obtaining version info, but this is common and safe. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code structure and comments are normal for a public Python package module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package setup code, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads package metadata and defines exports, with no dangerous operations or anomalies.",
