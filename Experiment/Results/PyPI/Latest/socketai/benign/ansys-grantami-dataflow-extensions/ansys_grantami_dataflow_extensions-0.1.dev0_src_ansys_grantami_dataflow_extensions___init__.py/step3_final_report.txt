  "purpose": "Package initializer that imports classes and retrieves version info for module setup.",

  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Static import and version retrieval, no untrusted data or external communication",
  "anomalies": "None",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py, importing classes and exceptions, setting __all__, and dynamically retrieving version info. No suspicious patterns, data leaks, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The version retrieval is a common practice and poses no security risk. The license comments are standard. No anomalies or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a typical package setup module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the minimal risk associated with version info retrieval, which is a standard pattern.",
