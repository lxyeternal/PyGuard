  "purpose": "Set up a standard Python logger with a NullHandler to prevent logging errors when no handlers are configured.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports the logging module and creates a logger instance.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data flows; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only initializes a logger without data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with a standard logging pattern and a license header with a future year (2025), likely a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, creates a logger named 'ansys.grantami.dataflow_extensions', and attaches a NullHandler to prevent errors if no other handlers are set. It contains no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The license header is standard and does not influence security. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code is a common pattern used in Python libraries to ensure safe logging behavior. All indicators point to benign, standard code with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging setup with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are accurate and appropriate given the code's nature.",
