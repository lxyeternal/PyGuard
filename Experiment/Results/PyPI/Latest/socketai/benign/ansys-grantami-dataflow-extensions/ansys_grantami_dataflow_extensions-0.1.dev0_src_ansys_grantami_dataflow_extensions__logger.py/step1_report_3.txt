{
  "purpose": "Set up a logger with a specific name and a null handler to prevent errors if no other handlers are configured.",
  "sources": "The code imports the logging module and creates a logger instance with a specific name.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only initializes a logger.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the standard logging library, creates a logger named 'ansys.grantami.dataflow_extensions', and adds a NullHandler to prevent logging errors if no other handlers are set. This is a common practice in library code to avoid 'No handlers could be found' warnings. There are no input sources, data processing, or outputs that could lead to security issues. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging setup without any malicious intent or security risks. It safely configures a logger for use in larger applications or libraries.",
