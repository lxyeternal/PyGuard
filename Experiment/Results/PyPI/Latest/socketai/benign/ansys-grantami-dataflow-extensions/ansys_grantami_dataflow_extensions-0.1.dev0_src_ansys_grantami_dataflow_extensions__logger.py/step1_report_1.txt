  "purpose": "Initialize a logger for the 'ansys.grantami.dataflow_extensions' module with a NullHandler to prevent errors if no other handlers are configured.",
  "sources": "The module imports the logging library and creates a logger instance for 'ansys.grantami.dataflow_extensions'.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only sets up logging configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for logging setup; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, creates a logger with a specific name, and adds a NullHandler. This prevents logging errors if no other handlers are attached, which is a common practice in Python libraries. There are no data inputs, no data outputs, and no suspicious or malicious constructs in this minimal setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logging initialization snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
