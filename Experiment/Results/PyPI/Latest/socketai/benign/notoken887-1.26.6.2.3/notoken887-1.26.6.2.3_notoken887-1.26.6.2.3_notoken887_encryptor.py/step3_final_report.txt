  "purpose": "A reversible character substitution cipher used for obfuscation or playful encoding of strings.",
  "sources": "Static string input in encrypt and decrypt methods, which are called with user-provided data.",
  "sinks": "The replace method calls, which transform input characters into emojis or symbols and vice versa.",
  "flows": "Input string flows into replace calls in encrypt, transforming characters into emojis; similarly, in decrypt, emojis are mapped back to characters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward, static character replacements without external dependencies or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple, static character substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings. It does not perform any network activity, file I/O, or execute dynamic code. The replacement mappings are fixed and predictable, serving primarily as obfuscation or playful encoding. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is benign, and the obfuscation level is minimal. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated≈0.1-0.2, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, reversible character substitution utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate low scores for malware and security risk. No modifications to the scores or analysis are necessary.",
