{
  "purpose": "A simple obfuscation tool that encodes and decodes text by replacing characters with emoji symbols.",
  "sources": "Input data is expected to be passed to encrypt() or decrypt() methods; the source is the input string to these functions.",
  "sinks": "The code only performs string replacements; there are no external data sinks, network connections, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input string to transformed output through character replacements in encrypt() and decrypt() functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is highly obfuscated in its purpose but lacks any malicious logic, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious code segments are present. The replace-based encoding is straightforward and does not involve any dynamic code execution or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The class provides reversible character replacement functions to encode and decode strings using emojis. It appears to serve purely as an obfuscation or encoding utility, with no signs of malicious behavior or data exfiltration. The structure is simple and transparent, with no external dependencies or suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning solely as a character-based obfuscation tool. There are no indicators of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. It is a harmless encoding/decoding utility.",
