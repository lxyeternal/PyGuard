{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character-based encoding and decoding, likely for obfuscation or light encryption of strings.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken as plaintext strings for encryption and as encoded strings for decryption.",
  "sinks": "Output is the transformed string; no direct data leaks or untrusted data processing observed within this code.",
  "flows": "Plaintext input -> encrypt method -> replaced with symbols -> output encrypted string. Encrypted string -> decrypt method -> replaced with original characters -> output decrypted string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external network calls. The code relies solely on character replacement, which is not inherently malicious. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present. No use of environment variables or external inputs is visible. The character replacements are static and predictable.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward character substitution cipher, converting alphanumeric and some special characters to emojis and other symbols, then reversing this process for decryption. No external inputs, no network activity, no file operations, and no dynamic execution are present. It does not perform any malicious actions, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The simplicity indicates it’s likely intended for obfuscation or fun encoding rather than security or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign character substitution cipher with no malicious intent. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. Its purpose is likely to obscure or encode text data in a reversible manner. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
