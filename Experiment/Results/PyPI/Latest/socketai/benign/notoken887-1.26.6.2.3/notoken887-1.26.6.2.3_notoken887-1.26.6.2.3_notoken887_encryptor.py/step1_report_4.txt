{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character-based substitution encryption and decryption functions for text data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods, which accept strings or encrypted tokens as input.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources, system commands, network, or files; it only returns transformed strings.",
  "flows": "Input string passes through 'encrypt' to produce an encrypted string; the encrypted string is passed to 'decrypt' to recover the original.",
  "anomalies": "The implementation uses extensive character replacements for encryption, which is extremely weak and easily reversible. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is detected. No external network or system calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple substitution cipher operations via string replacements, which are trivial to break and not secure. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network activity, file operations, or reverse shells. The methods are straightforward, with no external dependencies or complex logic. The structure is clear and does not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. There is no evidence of malware or supply chain attack vectors within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a basic character substitution cipher for encoding and decoding text. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its weakness lies in the extremely insecure method of encryption, but this does not constitute malicious intent or security compromise.",
