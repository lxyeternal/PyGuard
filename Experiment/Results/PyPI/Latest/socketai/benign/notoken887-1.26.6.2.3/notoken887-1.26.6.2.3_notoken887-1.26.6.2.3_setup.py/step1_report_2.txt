  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static data in setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or sensitive data operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of provocative email address 'hitler@gmail.com' and a URL 'https://thugging.org'. Package description suggests obfuscation testing, but no actual obfuscation or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata. No code execution, input handling, or data processing occurs. The author details are unusual but not malicious in themselves. The package description claims to be an obfuscation test library but contains no obfuscation or malicious logic. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with provocative metadata but no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It appears intended for package configuration without malicious intent. No malware or security risks identified.",
