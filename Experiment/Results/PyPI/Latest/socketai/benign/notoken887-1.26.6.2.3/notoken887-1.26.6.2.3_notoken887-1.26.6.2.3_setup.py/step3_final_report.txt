  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static strings in setup() parameters: name, version, author, author_email, description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no dynamic input or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author_email ('hitler@gmail.com') and url ('https://thugging.org') are unprofessional and provocative but do not constitute malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with static metadata. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The only notable anomaly is the unprofessional contact info, which raises suspicion but does not impact code security. The malware score is correctly zero, as no malicious activity is detected. The obfuscated score is zero, consistent with the absence of obfuscation. The security risk score is low (around 0.2), reflecting the suspicious metadata but no technical vulnerabilities. The high risk score (0.6) in some reports is justified if considering metadata as social engineering risk, but technically, the code remains benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration with suspicious contact info that does not constitute malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low, and no malware or obfuscation is present. The metadata warrants caution but does not impact the technical security of the package.",
