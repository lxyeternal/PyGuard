{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named generate_notes from a local module named main, likely for generating or processing notes.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which reads the generate_notes function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could leak data or execute code.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident; the code only contains an import statement with no further execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; there are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module, which is typical in modular Python projects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. Since no data handling, network communication, or suspicious code is present, the code appears benign. The simplicity suggests it's part of a larger project, but alone, it poses no security concern.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is typical for Python projects and does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
