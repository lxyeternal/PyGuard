{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named generate_notes from a local module called main, likely for generating or processing notes.",
  "sources": "The import statement is a source, as it loads code from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident here; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are visible.",
  "analysis": "This snippet contains a single import statement, which is standard in Python. It imports generate_notes from a module named main in the same package. There are no additional code lines, data handling, or function calls. Without further context, there are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or malicious code behavior. The import itself is benign and typical for modular Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard import statement for a function in a local module.",
