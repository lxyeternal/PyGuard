  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a straightforward import statement. No malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Risk justification:** The minimal code does not pose any security threat.\n- **Overall:** Correct assessment; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; a simple import with no suspicious activity.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- **Risk justification:** No indication of risk.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate; no changes necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous; benign import statement.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Risk justification:** No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Overall:** Correct; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Again, just an import statement.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.1, which is very low.\n- **Risk justification:** The slight security risk score seems conservative but acceptable given the minimal code.\n- **Overall:** Reasonable; no significant concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same benign import.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is a simple, benign import statement.\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero; no malicious activity is evident.\n- Obfuscated scores are zero, reflecting the code's clarity.\n- Security risk scores are minimal or zero, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that.",
