  "purpose": "Import the generate_notes function from a local module named main",
  "sources": "The code reads the main module in the same package directory to import generate_notes",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs are present in this single line of code",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import statement retrieves generate_notes from main module, with no data processing or transmission shown",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present; the code is minimal and standard",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple import statement, typical in Python modules to include functionality from another module within the same package. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security issues are detectable here. Since no runtime data handling, network activity, or obfuscated constructs are present, the security risk is minimal. The code does not indicate any malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not pose security risks.",
