{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'generate_notes' function from the local module 'main', likely to generate or process notes as part of a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module within the package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only an import statement; no runtime data flows present in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears standard; no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing a function named 'generate_notes' from a local module 'main'. There is no executable logic, no data handling, and no indication of malicious activity. The minimal nature of the code limits the scope of analysis, but nothing suspicious is apparent from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and standard in Python projects.",
