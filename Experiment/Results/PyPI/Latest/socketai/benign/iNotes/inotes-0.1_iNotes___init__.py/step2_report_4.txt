  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .main import generate_notes`.\n- The code is a straightforward import statement, typical in Python modules.\n- No runtime data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or anomalies are detected.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0.0 and security risks mostly at 0.0 or very low, which aligns with the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The reported issues are **not** present in the code. The code is simply an import statement with no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The code does not contain any errors, flaws, or mistakes.\n- The scores for malware and security risk are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforwardness of the code.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The code is minimal and standard; no obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The security risk scores are appropriate; they are very low or zero.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to zero, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or analysis.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate given the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is benign, standard Python import, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, and the scoring aligns with the code's simplicity. No further action or adjustment is needed.",
