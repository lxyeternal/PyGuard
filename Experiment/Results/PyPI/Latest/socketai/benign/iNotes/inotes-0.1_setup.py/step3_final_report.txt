  "purpose": "Standard setup.py configuration for packaging the iNotes Python project.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, dependencies, and entry point definitions; no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, defining package name, version, dependencies, and CLI entry point. It contains no dynamic code, external data reads, or malicious constructs. The dependencies are common packages, and the entry point is standard. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. The confidence level is high (1.0), as the analysis is based solely on static inspection. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are indicated.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
