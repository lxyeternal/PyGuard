{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'iNotes', defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Code reads package configuration, package discovery via find_packages(), and dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; standard setup process without dynamic code execution or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools for package distribution. It specifies package name, version, dependencies, and command-line entry point. All components follow standard conventions. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The dependencies listed are common libraries, and the entry point appears to invoke a main function from the package.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard and benign setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious activity or security risks.",
