  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is 0.1 primarily due to the recent Python version requirement, which does not constitute a security concern. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code."
