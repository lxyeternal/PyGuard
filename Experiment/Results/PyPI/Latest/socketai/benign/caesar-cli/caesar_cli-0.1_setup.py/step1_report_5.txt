  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'caesar-cli' Python package, including package metadata and entry points for command-line execution.",
  "sources": "Reading package data from static strings, reading 'README.md' file for long description",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; no runtime data handling present",
  "flows": "Static data assignment and file reading; no dynamic or untrusted data flow",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, utilizing setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for CLI commands. The only file read is 'README.md' for the long description. No user input, network calls, or untrusted data sources are involved. The package appears to be a simple encryption tool with a Caesar cipher, as indicated by description and name. There are no indications of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or malicious code snippets.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is a normal configuration file for packaging a Python CLI application. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code. It is safe and typical for a Python project setup.",
