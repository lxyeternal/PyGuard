      "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is 0.1 primarily due to the recent Python version requirement, which does not constitute a security concern. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for Caesar cipher operations with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The external 'process_message' function's safety is assumed but cannot be confirmed from this snippet. Overall, the code is safe, with low malware and obfuscation scores, and minimal security risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a Caesar cipher with minimal security concerns. The only issue is the abrupt termination via 'exit()' on invalid input, which could be improved with exception handling. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present. The overall security risk is very low."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python script serving as an entry point. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the implementation of 'caesar.cli.main()'. The scores and assessments across reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary."
