  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable due to lack of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "The file is essentially empty and contains only comments, with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The file contains only a comment indicating it can be empty or hold package variables or imports. There are no executable statements, input reading, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. No sources, sinks, or data flows are present. The absence of code suggests no malicious activity or obfuscation. The minimal content does not provide any malicious or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple placeholder or template with no executable logic, no malicious behavior, and no security risks identified.",
