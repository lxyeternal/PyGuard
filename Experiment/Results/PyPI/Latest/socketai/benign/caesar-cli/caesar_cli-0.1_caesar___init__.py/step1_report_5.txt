  "purpose": "The file appears to serve as a placeholder or template for package-level variables or imports, with no operational code present.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs in this file.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as there are no operations or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The file is essentially empty, which is unusual for functional code but not inherently suspicious; no hidden or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment indicating it can be empty or contain package variables/imports. There are no executable statements, data inputs, or outputs. The absence of code minimizes any security concerns or malicious activity. The file's purpose seems to be structural or placeholder in nature.",
  "conclusion": "This file is a non-operational placeholder with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any actions that could compromise security.",
