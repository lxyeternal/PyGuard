  "purpose": "CLI tool for encrypting or decrypting messages using a Caesar cipher.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments: 'sentence', 'key', and mode flags ('-e' or '-d').",
  "sinks": "Outputs the encrypted or decrypted message via print().",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> process_message() function call -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No insecure data handling or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script parses user input for a message and a key, then invokes a cipher processing function based on user choice. No data is read from or written to external files, network, or environment variables. The process_message function is imported from a local module, whose content is not provided, but assuming standard Caesar cipher functionality, no malicious behavior is evident in this code. The code ensures that either encryption or decryption mode is selected, preventing ambiguous operation. No suspicious or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI utility for Caesar cipher encryption/decryption with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
