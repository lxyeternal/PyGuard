  "purpose": "CLI tool for encrypting or decrypting messages using the Caesar cipher.",
  "sources": "User input via command line arguments (sentence, key, mode flags).",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output (print statements).",
  "flows": "User provides sentence and key -> process_message function is called with mode -> result is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments to determine whether to encrypt or decrypt a message using a Caesar cipher. It relies on an external module 'cipher' for the core processing. There are no hardcoded secrets, environment variable usage, or insecure coding practices. The only external interaction is user input and output, which is normal for CLI tools. No signs of malicious behavior or malware are present. The code appears to be a straightforward, benign implementation of a cipher utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign command-line utility for Caesar cipher encryption/decryption with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
