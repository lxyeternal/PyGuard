  "purpose": "CLI tool for encrypting or decrypting messages using a Caesar cipher.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from command line arguments (sentence, key, mode flags).",
  "sinks": "Outputs encrypted or decrypted message via print().",
  "flows": "User input -> process_message() function -> output via print().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of environment variables or network activity. The code calls an external function 'process_message' but its implementation is not shown.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward command-line interface for a Caesar cipher. It validates user input to ensure either encryption or decryption mode is selected, then invokes the process_message() function accordingly. No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior is evident. The security considerations depend on the implementation of process_message, which is external and not provided; however, based on this code alone, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple CLI wrapper for a Caesar cipher process. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues in the provided snippet. Its security posture is minimal and primarily depends on the external process_message function, which appears to perform encryption/decryption locally.",
