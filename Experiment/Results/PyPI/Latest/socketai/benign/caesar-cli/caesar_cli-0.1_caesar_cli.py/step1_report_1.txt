  "purpose": "CLI tool for encrypting or decrypting messages using a Caesar cipher.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line arguments ('sentence' and 'key').",
  "sinks": "Outputs encrypted/decrypted message via print(). No other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> process_message function -> output via print().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code, no suspicious variable names or code constructs. No indication of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts user input via command-line arguments and passes them to an imported function 'process_message' for encryption/decryption. It validates the mode flags and outputs the result. No external network calls, no file I/O, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code appears straightforward and consistent with a typical CLI cipher utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple command-line utility for Caesar cipher operations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on an external 'process_message' function, but based on this snippet alone, there are no indicators of malicious intent.",
