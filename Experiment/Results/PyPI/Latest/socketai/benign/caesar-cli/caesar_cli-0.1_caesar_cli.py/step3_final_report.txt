{
  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper for Caesar cipher encryption/decryption that delegates core processing to an external function.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments: 'sentence' and 'key'.",
  "sinks": "Output via print() after processing message.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments -> process_message() call -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface that validates user input, ensures either encryption or decryption mode is selected, and calls an external 'process_message' function. No network activity, file I/O, or suspicious constructs are present. The security implications depend on 'process_message', which is external and not provided, but the wrapper itself appears benign. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for Caesar cipher operations with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The external 'process_message' function's safety is assumed but cannot be confirmed from this snippet. Overall, the code is safe, with low malware and obfuscation scores, and minimal security risk.",
