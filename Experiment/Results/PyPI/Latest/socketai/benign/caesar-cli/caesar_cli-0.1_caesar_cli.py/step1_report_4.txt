  "purpose": "CLI tool for encrypting or decrypting messages using a Caesar cipher.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from command line arguments: 'sentence' and 'key'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs encrypted or decrypted message to stdout via print().",
  "flows": "Input from command line arguments flows into process_message, then output via print().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a simple command-line interface for a Caesar cipher. It parses arguments, ensures mode selection, and calls an external function 'process_message' with user inputs. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. No obfuscated or malicious behavior detected. The code relies on an external module for core logic, which appears to be benign based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward CLI interface for a cipher utility with no apparent malicious intent or security risks.",
