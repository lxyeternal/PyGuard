{
  "purpose": "The function encrypts or decrypts a message based on a provided key and mode.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'sentence' (message to process), 'key' (encryption/decryption key), 'mode' (operation mode).",
  "sinks": "The function outputs the processed message via return; no external sinks for untrusted data are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the encryption/decryption logic; the processed result is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'exit()' upon invalid key input is abrupt; no other suspicious or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Caesar cipher-like encryption/decryption with input validation for 'key'. It handles alphabetic characters, shifting them according to the key, and leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged. The use of 'exit()' for invalid keys could cause abrupt termination but is not inherently malicious. No network calls, file I/O, or hidden behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and common for simple cipher implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic encryption/decryption without malicious intent or suspicious activity. The abrupt termination on invalid input is a minor concern but not malicious. Overall, the code appears benign with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
