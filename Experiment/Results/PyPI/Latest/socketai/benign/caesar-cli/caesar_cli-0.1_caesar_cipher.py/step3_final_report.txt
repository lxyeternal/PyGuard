{
  "purpose": "Implement a Caesar cipher for encrypting or decrypting alphabetic messages, leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'sentence'; 'key' validation check",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows to external systems or sensitive areas",
  "flows": "Input 'sentence' is processed character-by-character; alphabetic characters are shifted based on 'key' and 'mode'; non-alphabetic characters are preserved",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exit()' upon invalid 'key' input causes abrupt termination; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward Caesar cipher with proper alphabet handling. It validates 'key' as an integer; if invalid, it prints an error and terminates. No network, file I/O, or malicious code is present. The use of 'exit()' is a control flow concern but not malicious. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected. The code is simple, clean, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a Caesar cipher with minimal security concerns. The only issue is the abrupt termination via 'exit()' on invalid input, which could be improved with exception handling. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present. The overall security risk is very low.",
