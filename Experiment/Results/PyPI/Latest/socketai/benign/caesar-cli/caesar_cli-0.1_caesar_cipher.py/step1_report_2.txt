{
  "purpose": "Encrypt or decrypt a message using a Caesar cipher based on the specified mode.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'sentence' and 'key'. No external data sources.",
  "sinks": "The function returns the transformed message. No data leaks or external output besides the return value.",
  "flows": "Input 'sentence' and 'key' are processed to produce an encrypted or decrypted message; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'exit()' on invalid key is abrupt and could terminate program unexpectedly, but is not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No obfuscation, no suspicious network activity, and no code injections detected.",
  "analysis": "The function performs simple Caesar cipher encryption/decryption, a well-known algorithm. It checks if the key is an integer, printing an error and exiting if not. The core logic shifts alphabetic characters appropriately, leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged. No external data sources or sinks are used. There is no suspicious or malicious behavior, no data exfiltration, nor malicious side effects. The abrupt exit on invalid key might be considered poor practice but does not constitute malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a straightforward Caesar cipher with minimal complexity. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The only concern is the use of 'exit()' which can terminate a program unexpectedly if used improperly, but this is not malicious. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
