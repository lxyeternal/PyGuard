  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a Caesar cipher with minimal security concerns. The only issue is the abrupt termination via 'exit()' on invalid input, which could be improved with exception handling. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present. The overall security risk is very low."
