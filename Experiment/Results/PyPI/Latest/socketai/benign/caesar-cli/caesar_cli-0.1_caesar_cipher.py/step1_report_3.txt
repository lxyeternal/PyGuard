{
  "purpose": "The function is designed to encrypt or decrypt a message using a simple Caesar cipher based on the provided key.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'sentence' and 'key'. The 'sentence' parameter is read to process the message, and 'key' is read to determine shift value.",
  "sinks": "The processed message is returned; no external sinks are used in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input 'sentence' and 'key' are processed to produce an encrypted or decrypted message, but no external data or network interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'exit()' on invalid key input could abruptly terminate execution; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic present. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard Caesar cipher encryption/decryption, checking if 'key' is an integer, then applying a shift to alphabetic characters. Non-alphabetic characters are preserved as-is. The only unusual aspect is the use of 'exit()' to terminate on invalid 'key' input, which is a simple control flow decision. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. No network or file system operations are present. The code appears straightforward and intended for a basic cipher function.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple Caesar cipher implementation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The abrupt termination on invalid input could be considered poor error handling but not malicious. Overall, the code appears benign.",
