{
  "purpose": "The function encrypts or decrypts a message using a Caesar cipher based on the provided key and mode.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'sentence', 'key', and optional 'mode'. The 'sentence' is the message to process, 'key' is the shift value, and 'mode' determines encryption or decryption.",
  "sinks": "The function returns the processed message. No external sinks such as network connections or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are read at the start; the message is processed character-by-character with conditional shifting based on mode; the result is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The function uses 'exit()' on invalid key input, which terminates the program abruptly. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code only performs straightforward Caesar cipher logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic Caesar cipher encryption/decryption. It checks if 'key' is an integer; if not, it terminates. It processes each character, shifting alphabetic characters accordingly and leaving others unchanged. There are no network calls, data leaks, or malicious code. The use of 'exit()' might be considered abrupt but does not indicate malicious intent; it merely halts execution on invalid input. Overall, the logic is simple, standard, and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Caesar cipher implementation with input validation. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The abrupt termination on invalid key input is a minor concern but not malicious. Overall, safe and straightforward.",
