{
  "purpose": "To encrypt or decrypt a message using a simple Caesar cipher based on the provided key.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'sentence', 'key', and 'mode'. No external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs the encrypted or decrypted message via return. No external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'sentence' and 'key' are processed; the 'key' influences character shifting; output is the processed string.",
  "anomalies": "The code terminates execution if the key is not an integer, which is abrupt but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The function performs a straightforward Caesar cipher shift for alphabetic characters, maintaining case. It checks the key's type and exits if invalid, which is a safety measure. The code does not read external data, connect to networks, or execute malicious actions. No evidence of malicious code or backdoors. The logic is simple and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a basic Caesar cipher encryption/decryption function with input validation. There is no malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risk detected. The abrupt exit on invalid key is a control flow choice but not harmful. Overall, this is benign encryption code.",
