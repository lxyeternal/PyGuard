  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network/file sinks, dynamic execution points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing, environment reads, network calls, dynamic eval/exec.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation, dynamic code execution, complex control flow, lack of explicit malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify code presence or absence, with scores aligned to their reasoning. Reports 1, 2, 3, and 5 indicate benign code with no malicious features, justified by zero malware and obfuscation scores. Report 4 notes potential obfuscation and dynamic behavior, assigning moderate suspicion scores (malware 0.2, obfuscated 0.4, risk 0.3), which are reasonable given the description. Slightly higher malware scores could be considered if explicit malicious activity was confirmed, but current scores are cautious and appropriate. Overall, the scoring reflects the evidence and reasoning provided.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and well-justified. No major issues detected. Minor adjustments could be made to malware scores in complex, obfuscated cases if further evidence confirms malicious intent. Overall, the assessments are sound and appropriately cautious.",
