  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'buffalo-workflow' with metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; package metadata and dependencies declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially harmful actions are present; setup configuration is static.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive functions or outputs that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup routine using setuptools. It reads a README file for description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package data. No untrusted input is processed, and no suspicious code paths are present. The dependencies are minimal and standard. The setup script is straightforward and does not contain any malicious logic or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate package distribution.",
