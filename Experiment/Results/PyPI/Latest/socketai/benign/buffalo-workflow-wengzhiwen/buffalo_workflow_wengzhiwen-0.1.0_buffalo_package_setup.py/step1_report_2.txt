{
  "purpose": "This code is for configuring the packaging and distribution of a Python project named 'buffalo-workflow'.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; specifying package data; defining setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Reading file input (README.md) as source, then passing static parameters to setup(), no external data flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup.py content with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README.md file for the long description, then calls setuptools.setup() with static, hardcoded package metadata. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity or secret handling. All used libraries are standard for Python package setup. The code strictly handles package configuration without any malicious logic or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious operations beyond standard package setup procedures.",
