  "purpose": "This code configures the setup process for a Python package named 'buffalo-workflow', defining its metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, importing package setup functions, and reading package dependencies from install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present; no code executes untrusted input or network operations.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> Setup configuration -> Package installation dependencies and data inclusion.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated patterns detected. The code performs standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a markdown file for description, then uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and package data. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing from external untrusted sources is evident. It adheres to standard Python packaging practices, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks detected.",
