{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'buffalo-workflow' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network or file operations; no code execution or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads static file for description; package setup data flows are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a Markdown file for the long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package data. There are no code injection, data leaks, network communications, or suspicious behavior. Usage of hardcoded values appears benign, intended for package configuration. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily manages package metadata and dependencies without any harmful operations.",
