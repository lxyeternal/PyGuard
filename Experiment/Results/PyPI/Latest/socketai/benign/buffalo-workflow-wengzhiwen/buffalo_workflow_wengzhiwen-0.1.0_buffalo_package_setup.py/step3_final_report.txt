  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; static metadata fields in setup() call; no untrusted input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks, network activity, or code execution points.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for packaging a Python project. It reads a static README file, defines static metadata, dependencies, and package data. There are no dynamic behaviors, network operations, or untrusted inputs. The code structure is simple and standard, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. All security signals indicate benign intent. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify it as such, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
