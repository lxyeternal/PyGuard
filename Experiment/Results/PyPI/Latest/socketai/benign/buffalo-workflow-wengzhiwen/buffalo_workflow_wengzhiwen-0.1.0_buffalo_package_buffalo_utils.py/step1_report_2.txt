  "anomalies": [
    "Use of standard open() and os.makedirs() for file handling, no risky dynamic code execution or external data injection observed",
    "No hardcoded credentials, no environment variable misuse",
    "No obfuscated or malicious-looking code patterns",
    "No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration",
    "Error handling appears standard, no hidden backdoors or secret data leaks"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O operations and YAML serialization/deserialization with appropriate error handling. It uses safe YAML loading (yaml.safe_load()) and standard file operations. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network access, code injection, or data exfiltration, are present. The functions include basic exception handling, and no untrusted data is used in a dangerous way. The use of os.makedirs() ensures directory creation before writing files, which is typical and safe. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility module for YAML and file management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility module for YAML parsing and file operations with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
