  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for safe YAML handling and file operations in Buffalo utility module.",
  "sources": "Reading YAML strings, reading files from disk, and writing data to files.",
  "sinks": "File writing functions (write_file, save_yaml_file) where data is written to disk.",
  "flows": "Input YAML string -> safe_load_yaml -> parse YAML; File path -> read_file -> load_yaml_file; Data -> dump_yaml -> save_yaml_file -> write_file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code uses standard library functions and safe YAML handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions for handling YAML data and file IO. It uses safe methods (e.g., yaml.safe_load) and properly manages exceptions. File read/write operations include directory creation and error handling but do not contain any suspicious or malicious logic. No obfuscated code, external network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign utility library focused on safe file and YAML handling. There are no signs of malicious intent or supply chain security issues.",
