  "purpose": "Utility functions for safe YAML handling and file operations",
  "sources": "File reading functions (`read_file`, `load_yaml_file`), YAML parsing (`yaml.safe_load`), file writing functions (`write_file`, `save_yaml_file`)",
  "sinks": "File system operations (`open`, `os.makedirs`), YAML dump (`yaml.dump`)",
  "flows": "Input data from files or strings flows into YAML parsing or dumping functions, then to file writes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries",
  "analysis": "The code employs safe YAML parsing (`yaml.safe_load`) and standard file handling with exception management. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The exception handling is appropriate, and no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are evident. The minimal risk score reflects the benign nature, with no malware or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for YAML and file operations, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores are consistent with its functionality and security posture.",
