  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for safe YAML handling and file operations in Buffalo project.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include YAML strings and file contents read via read_file().",
  "sinks": "Output data includes YAML strings generated by dump_yaml() and file writes via write_file().",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (YAML strings, file reads) through safe_load_yaml(), dump_yaml(), and then to file writes, with no untrusted data directly influencing system commands or sensitive areas.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated sections detected. No dynamic execution or code injection observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard YAML serialization/deserialization and file I/O with error handling. All inputs are read from files or strings and processed safely without executing or evaluating untrusted data. The use of yaml.safe_load() prevents code execution via YAML, and file handling uses standard OS functions. No suspicious patterns, credentials, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears secure and free from malicious behavior. It performs standard file and YAML operations with proper error handling, without any signs of malware or malicious intent.",
