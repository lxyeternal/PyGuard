  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for safe YAML handling and file operations in Buffalo system",
  "sources": "Input data sources include YAML strings and file contents read from disk",
  "sinks": "Output data is written to files; YAML data is dumped to strings before writing",
  "flows": "YAML strings are loaded from inputs, file contents are read, processed, and then written back to files",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard safe YAML parsing, serialization, file reading, and writing with appropriate exception handling. No external data is being sent over the network, nor are there any indications of malicious behavior. File operations use standard Python functions without dangerous patterns. The import of local exceptions suggests modular error handling but does not introduce malicious behavior. No use of untrusted input for dangerous operations or security-compromising actions.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a legitimate utility library for handling YAML and file I/O operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The code is straightforward, safe, and well-structured.",
