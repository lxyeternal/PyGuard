  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for safe YAML handling and file operations in Buffalo project",
  "sources": "User-provided YAML strings, file paths for reading and writing files",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations, YAML parsing/dumping, directory creation",
  "flows": "YAML input -> safe_load_yaml / dump_yaml; File path input -> read_file / write_file; YAML data -> save_yaml_file",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of standard library functions and safe YAML parsing methods. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file I/O and YAML serialization/deserialization with proper exception handling. It uses safe YAML methods (`yaml.safe_load`) and standard OS functions for directory creation. No external or untrusted data is processed insecurely; no suspicious network activity or malicious backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for YAML and file operations with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Overall security risk is negligible.",
