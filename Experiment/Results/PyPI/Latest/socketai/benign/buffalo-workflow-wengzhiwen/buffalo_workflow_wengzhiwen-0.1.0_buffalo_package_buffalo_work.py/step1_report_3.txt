{
  "purpose": "Define a Work class to model workflow tasks with status management and descriptive attributes.",
  "sources": "Class initialization (__init__), set_status method, string representation (__str__).",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly interacts with untrusted input, external data, or performs network or system operations.",
  "flows": "Constructor initializes attributes; set_status updates status with validation; __str__ generates string output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code follows standard class design without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward data container class with methods for setting and checking work status. It uses a custom exception for invalid status, which appears standard. No external data sources, network operations, or potentially malicious behaviors are present. The class is well-structured and does not perform any unsafe operations or contain hidden code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of a work unit class with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It solely manages internal state with validation and representation methods.",
