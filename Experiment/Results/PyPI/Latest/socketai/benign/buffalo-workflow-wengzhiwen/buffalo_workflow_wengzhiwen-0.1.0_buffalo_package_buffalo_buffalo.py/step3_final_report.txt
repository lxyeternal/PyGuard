  "purpose": "Filesystem-based project management utility handling project creation, loading, and workflow updates.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directories, project description YAML files, imported get_template_path() function for fallback template.",
  "sinks": "Reading and writing project files, creating directories, updating project states.",
  "flows": "Filesystem directories and files as input sources; project and work objects are loaded, modified, and saved back to files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import for fallback template; no hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem operations for project management, including directory creation, project loading, and saving. Error handling is appropriate. No suspicious patterns such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The fallback to a built-in template via dynamic import is a common pattern and not malicious. The overall structure is clear, with proper exception handling and no obfuscation or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, filesystem-based project management utility with no malicious intent or security threats. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the risk score is minimal, reflecting typical filesystem operations. No adjustments are necessary.",
