  "purpose": "Path management and module setup for the Buffalo project management toolkit.",
  "sources": "Static filesystem paths generated by get_template_dir() and get_template_path() functions based on the current file location.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Static path functions generate paths without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; functions are straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules, defines metadata, exception classes, utility functions, and provides two functions to retrieve template directory and file paths. All functions operate based on static paths derived from the module's location. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The code is well-structured, standard for package setup, and exhibits no suspicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard setup code for a Python package, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal security risk score (around 0.05) is appropriate given its static nature and lack of external data handling.",
