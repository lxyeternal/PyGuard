{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a toolkit for project management, providing class imports, utility functions, and path management for templates.",
  "sources": "Imports of internal modules and functions, such as exceptions and utils, and functions that retrieve file paths.",
  "sinks": "File path functions returning directory and file paths; no direct sinks for untrusted data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; functions mainly return static or internally derived paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. All functions return predefined paths or classes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constants, imports, and utility functions for managing project templates and exceptions. The functions get_template_dir and get_template_path generate and return file system paths based on the current module location. No input/output operations, network calls, or execution of untrusted data are present. The imported modules are standard or internal, and there is no indication of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for a project management toolkit, focusing on path management and module setup. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
