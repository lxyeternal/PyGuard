  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from built-in Exception classes, no external data or input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "Static class inheritance hierarchy; no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception classes. There are no input/output operations, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. The classes serve as error types within a larger application. No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious code elements are present. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose and documentation. Given the benign nature, there are no security risks, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The reports accurately assess the code as safe, with appropriate scoring. No modifications or further security analysis are necessary.",
