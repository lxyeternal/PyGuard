  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is solely a set of Python class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output operations, or external data handling. The classes inherit from built-in Exception classes and contain descriptive docstrings.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:  \n   No logical errors or flaws are evident in the code. The class hierarchy is consistent, and the purpose is clear. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, the code is straightforward and lacks obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score (0.5 or higher)**: All reports assign a risk of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely for defining exception classes with no external interactions, no data leaks, and no malicious intent, a risk score of 0 is justified. Assigning higher scores would be unreasonable.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:  \n   The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions of vulnerabilities, as the code doesn't perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n**My Overall Assessment**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign exception hierarchy with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is safe, well-structured, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Final recommendation**: No changes needed. The code poses no security risk.",
