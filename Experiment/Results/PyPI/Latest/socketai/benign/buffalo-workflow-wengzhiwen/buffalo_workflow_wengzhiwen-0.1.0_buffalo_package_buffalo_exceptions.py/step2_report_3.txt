  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**:  \n   The provided code is a straightforward set of Python class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from built-in Exception classes. There are no input/output operations, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. The class definitions are static and purely serve as error types within a larger application.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:  \n   The reports consistently state that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. Given the code's simplicity, this assessment is accurate. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.  \n   \n   The scores are consistent and reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely for defining exception classes with no external interactions, dynamic behaviors, or data processing, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions or Potential Vulnerabilities**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard class definitions. No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured set of custom exception classes with no malicious or security risks. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**My Estimated Scores**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
