  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to Buffalo application errors",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code defines exception classes without external data input",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, output, or external interactions present",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only declares class definitions without runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard class inheritance for exception handling with no unusual constructs or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple custom exception class definitions inheriting from base Exception classes. There are no external data sources, no data processing, no network operations, no hardcoded credentials, and no obfuscated or dynamic code. The structure is straightforward, serving as a part of error handling within a larger system. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
