  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a larger Buffalo project.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and string literals for exception messages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; only class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code purely defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Python class definitions inheriting from built-in Exception classes, used for error handling. No input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling are present. The classes are well-structured and do not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The purpose appears to be standard error classification, typical for a project’s exception hierarchy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of custom exception classes for error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
