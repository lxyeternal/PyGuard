  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Buffalo project, organizing various error types.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and string literals within class docstrings.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is solely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple class definitions inheriting from base Exception classes, with descriptive docstrings. No input handling, data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution present. No hardcoded secrets, external calls, or suspicious patterns are observed. The structure is straightforward and typical for defining custom exceptions, indicating no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining exception classes with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
