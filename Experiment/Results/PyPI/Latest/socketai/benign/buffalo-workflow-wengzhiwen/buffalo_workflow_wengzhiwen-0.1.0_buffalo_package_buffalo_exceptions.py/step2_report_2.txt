  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception classes.\n- No input/output operations, data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The class definitions are static, straightforward, and well-documented.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs.\n- The purpose appears to be standard error handling within a larger project.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reported \"malware\" score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The \"confidence\" score is 1, reflecting high certainty that the code is safe.\n- No anomalies, hidden behaviors, or external data handling are detected.\n\n**Evaluation of scores:**\n- All reports' scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent, security risks, or supply chain compromise.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- I agree with the existing scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- The overall risk assessment should remain at the lowest level, indicating no security concern.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and typical for error handling.\n- No further action needed.",
