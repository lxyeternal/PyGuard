  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from built-in Exception classes.\n   - There are no input/output operations, dynamic code execution, external data handling, or any runtime behavior.\n   - The classes are well-structured, with descriptive docstrings, and serve as an error hierarchy for a larger project.\n\n2. **Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or external dependencies.\n   - The code is static and purely declarative.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities & Risks:**\n   - Since these are just class definitions, they do not introduce runtime vulnerabilities.\n   - The absence of dynamic behavior, external data handling, or code execution means there's no attack surface here.\n   - The purpose is standard error classification, typical in software projects.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - **malware: 0**\n     - **obfuscated: 0**\n     - **securityRisk: 0**\n   - These are appropriate given the analysis.\n   - The risk scores are also correctly set to 0, as there's no indication of any security threat.\n\n5. **Any discrepancies or points to challenge?**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No claims are made about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all conclusions are justified.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is reasonable.\n\n6. **Overall assessment:**\n   - The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n   - The scores are appropriate and align with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assessments.\n- I would assign the following scores:\n  - **malware: 0**\n  - **obfuscated: 0**\n  - **risk: 0**\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, benign set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent.",
