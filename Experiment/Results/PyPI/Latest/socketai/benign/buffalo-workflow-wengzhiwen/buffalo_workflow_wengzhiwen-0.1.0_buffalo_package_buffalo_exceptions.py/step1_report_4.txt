  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to Buffalo application errors",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources used; class definitions are static",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow to external systems or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely class hierarchy definitions without data processing",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any code executing dynamically, handling secrets, or external communication; no suspicious or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from built-in Exception classes. It includes multiple subclasses for different error types, all structured as simple class declarations with docstrings. There are no input sources, external data handling, or any code that could be exploited or used maliciously. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious or security risk features. It does not perform any data processing, communication, or dynamic behavior that could pose a threat.",
