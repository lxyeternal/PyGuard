{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to Buffalo application errors",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading; class definitions are static",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow; class inheritance does not involve data processing or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; simply class definitions and docstrings",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from base Exception classes with descriptive docstrings. There is no dynamic code, input handling, external data access, or potential data leaks. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or security issues are present. The structure is straightforward and standard for Python exception classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, only defining a hierarchy of custom exceptions for a Buffalo application. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
