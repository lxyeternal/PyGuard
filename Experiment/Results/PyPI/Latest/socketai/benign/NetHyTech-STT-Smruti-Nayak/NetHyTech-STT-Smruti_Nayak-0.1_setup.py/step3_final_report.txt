  "purpose": "This is a standard Python setup script defining package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only declares static package information and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the script does not process user input or perform runtime actions beyond package setup.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script is static and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script using setuptools, with static metadata and dependencies ('selenium' and 'webdriver_manager'). It contains no dynamic code, no environment variables, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, with minimal security risk scores. The dependencies are common and legitimate for automation tasks. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
