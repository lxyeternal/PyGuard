{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package named 'NetHyTech-STT-Smruti_Nayak' with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from package metadata fields such as name, version, author, author_email, description, and the 'install_requires' list for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the installation of dependencies ('selenium' and 'webdriver_manager'), which can be used maliciously if misused but are common in legitimate automation tools.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading package metadata and dependencies, which are then used during package installation; no untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dependencies are present. All dependencies are standard, open-source packages.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, utilizing setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dependencies are common packages for web automation, and no unusual code behaviors are observed. The script solely manages package configuration without executing any runtime code that could perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate, standard, and free of malicious behavior. It is a typical configuration file for Python packaging with no evident security risks or malware indicators.",
