{
  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'NetHyTech-STT-Smruti_Nayak' with its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from the package's setup configuration, including the package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not execute untrusted data or perform network or file operations directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are observed. The package name and author info are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define a package, specify dependencies, and set metadata. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious code are present. The dependencies are common Python packages for web automation and testing. The package name and author details seem legitimate. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security concerns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a typical package configuration.",
