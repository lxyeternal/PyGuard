  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, straightforward setup script, no suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup script, dependencies are common.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly above zero risk, possibly due to the dependencies involved in automation, but still very low. The score seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard setup script, no suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, dependencies are standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Standard setup script, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. I concur with malware=0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports assign 0. Correct.\n- **Risk Score:** The only slight variation is Report 2's 0.1, which is justified given the dependencies involved in automation tools, but overall, the risk remains minimal.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The dependencies 'selenium' and 'webdriver_manager' are legitimate and commonly used for automation tasks. They are not inherently malicious.\n- The setup script is standard, with no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no hidden code.\n- There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 for the second report, but it's marginal)\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with my assessment. The package appears benign, with no security concerns or malicious intent.",
