{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata and dependencies for a speech-to-text Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package information and lists dependencies 'selenium' and 'webdriver_manager'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; dependencies are standard and are not supplied dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated logic are detected. The code structure is typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata and dependencies. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no code injection points, no network activity, and no indications of sabotage. All dependencies are common in automation and testing contexts. The code appears safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply declares package information and dependencies, with no anomalies or suspicious elements.",
