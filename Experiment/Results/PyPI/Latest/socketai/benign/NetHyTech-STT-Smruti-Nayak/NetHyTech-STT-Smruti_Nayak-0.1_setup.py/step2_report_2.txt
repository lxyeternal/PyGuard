  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, compare their assessments, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script using setuptools.\n- It defines package metadata (name, version, author, email, description).\n- It specifies dependencies: `'selenium'` and `'webdriver_manager'`.\n- No dynamic code, user input, environment variables, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code appears benign, straightforward, and typical for Python packaging.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Presence of the code itself:** The code matches the description; no anomalies or malicious code are detected.\n- **Malware or obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None evident.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as it is a static configuration script.\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign, standard, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard setup, dependencies are common.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Note:** The slight securityRisk score (0.1) is perhaps overcautious but not unreasonable given dependencies could be misused in other contexts.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion, no suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Note:** Consistent.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Same, standard setup, no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis:\n- All reports agree the code is benign.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk scores are minimal, with one report at 0.1, which is acceptable given the dependencies are common and do not imply malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or 0.1, depending on how conservative you want to be; 0 is justified here.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| 0          | 0            | 0      |\n\n**Justification:**\n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- Dependencies are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.\n- The setup script is straightforward and does not perform any runtime operations that could be malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The initial reports are accurate; the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. I recommend maintaining the malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and the security risk at 0 as well.",
