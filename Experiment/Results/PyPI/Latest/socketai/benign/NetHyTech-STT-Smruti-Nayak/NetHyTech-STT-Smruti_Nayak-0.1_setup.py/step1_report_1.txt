{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'NetHyTech-STT-Smruti_Nayak' for distribution, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version, author, email, description), and specifies dependencies 'selenium' and 'webdriver_manager' via 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or code execution are present. The code mainly sets package configuration and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the setup script merely declares package info and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are present. The email and author info are straightforward, with no hidden or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines package metadata, and specifies dependencies required for the package. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data handling is involved. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or code injections. The dependencies listed are common for Selenium-based projects and do not suggest malicious intent. The code structure is standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities. It is a straightforward package configuration file.",
