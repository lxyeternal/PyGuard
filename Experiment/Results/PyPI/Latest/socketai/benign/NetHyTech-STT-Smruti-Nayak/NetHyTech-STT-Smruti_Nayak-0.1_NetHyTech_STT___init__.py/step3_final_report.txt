{
  "purpose": "Automates speech capture via a web interface using Selenium, interacts with webpage elements, and writes output to a local file.",
  "sources": "Reads webpage DOM elements ('startButton', 'output'), reads current working directory for 'input.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Writes speech output to 'input.txt', prints to console.",
  "flows": "Webpage element interaction triggers output updates; output text is detected and written to file when changed.",
  "anomalies": "Uses headless Chrome with media stream auto-permission; indefinite polling loop; no obfuscated code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Selenium automation for speech listening, with media permissions set for microphone access. It monitors webpage output and writes changes to a local file. No suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The use of auto media permissions and headless mode could raise privacy concerns but are typical in testing scenarios. The code's logic is straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign automation tool for speech capture, with no malware or obfuscation detected. The low risk score (0.2) reflects potential privacy considerations but does not indicate malicious activity. The code is straightforward and aligns with the reports' assessments.",
