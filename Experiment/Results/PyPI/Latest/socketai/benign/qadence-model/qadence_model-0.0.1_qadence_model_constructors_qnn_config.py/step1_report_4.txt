{
  "purpose": "This code defines configuration data classes for quantum neural network feature mapping and ansatz strategies, including parameters for basis sets, scaling, input handling, and various strategy options.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources or input reading functions; configuration parameters are initialized from defaults or provided during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network connections, or external data outputs are present; no untrusted data processing or leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up configuration objects and internal validation logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard configuration management with validation, without any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscated code, unusual constructs, or dynamic code execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script defines two dataclasses, FeatureMapConfig and AnsatzConfig, used for configuring quantum feature maps and ansatz layers. It performs input validation and automatically adjusts configurations based on certain conditions, such as strategy types and operation compatibility. No external inputs are processed during runtime, and no suspicious patterns, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or secret handling, are present. The code relies on standard Python features, type annotations, and logging warnings for misconfigurations. The overall structure and logic are consistent with a typical configuration setup for quantum algorithms, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a configuration setup for quantum neural network parameters with validation logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured module for managing configurations with no suspicious signals.",
