  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a configuration module for quantum feature maps and ansatz strategies, with validation logic. No external data, network calls, or malicious patterns are present.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — the code is purely configuration with validation, no security risks.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Justification:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard configuration logic, with no malicious elements. The high confidence (0.9) is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code as straightforward configuration classes with validation, no external inputs or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — purely configuration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Justification:** The assessment aligns with the code's purpose. The confidence (1) is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a configuration module with validation logic, no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion — configuration classes with validation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with validation logic, no external data handling, no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — slightly above zero, but given the code's nature, this is probably a conservative default.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward configuration; the small security risk score (0.1) is acceptable and likely overcautious.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity detected; the slight risk score is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All are correctly set to 0, as no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** Correctly 0 for all reports; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate for configuration code with no external data handling or system modifications.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, a risk score of 0 for all reports is justified. The small 0.1 in report 5 can be maintained as a conservative measure but does not indicate actual risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, well-structured configuration logic with no signs of malicious activity.**",
