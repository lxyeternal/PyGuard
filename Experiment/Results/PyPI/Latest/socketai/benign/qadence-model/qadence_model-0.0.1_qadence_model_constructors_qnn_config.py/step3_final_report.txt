  "purpose": "Configuration classes for quantum feature maps and ansatz, with validation logic.",
  "sources": "Internal class attributes, validation assertions, and warnings; no external data or system modifications.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Initialization and validation of configuration attributes; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for quantum neural network configurations, including validation and warning logic to ensure consistency. It uses standard Python constructs, with no external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The import statements are from standard and scientific libraries, and the logic is straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration module for quantum algorithms. It contains no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and poses no security risks. The high risk score in one report (0.95) is unjustified and should be lowered to 0.1 or 0, as the code does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
