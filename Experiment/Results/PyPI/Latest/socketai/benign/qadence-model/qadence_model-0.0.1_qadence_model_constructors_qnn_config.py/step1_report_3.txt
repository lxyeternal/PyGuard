{
  "purpose": "This code defines configuration data classes for quantum neural network feature maps and ansatz configurations, including parameter handling, strategies, and validation logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from class initialization parameters, environment variables are not used, and no external data sources are referenced.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or output mechanisms are present; no untrusted data is sent over network or stored persistently.",
  "flows": "The flow involves class instantiation with parameters, internal validation, and conditional modifications of configuration attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No dynamic code execution or reflection. The only warnings are related to configuration validation, which is standard for dataclasses.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of dataclass definitions with validation logic in __post_init__ methods. It sets up configuration objects for feature mapping and ansatz strategies in quantum computing applications. No external input/output, network communication, or dynamic code execution is observed. The logging calls are for warnings about configuration inconsistencies. Overall, the code appears to serve as structured configuration data with internal validation, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a configuration module for quantum neural network parameters, implementing validation and default setup. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or sabotage. The code is standard and safe, focused on configuration validation and setup.",
