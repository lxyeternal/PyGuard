{
  "purpose": "Define configuration data structures for feature maps and ansatz in a quantum computing framework, including validation and default settings.",
  "sources": "Imports (sympy, qadence modules, logging), class attribute definitions, __post_init__ methods, assertions, and warnings.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external data handling present; no external data input or output streams detected.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters flow within class methods, especially __post_init__ for validation and default adjustments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions and warnings for validation is standard; no suspicious hard-coded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. No indication of code injection or malicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines dataclass configurations with validation logic to ensure proper parameter consistency and constraints. There are no external data sources, no network communication, or file manipulations. The assertions and warnings are for parameter validation, not malicious behavior. The imports are standard for a quantum circuit configuration framework. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present. The code is well-structured, focusing on configuration management, and does not exhibit any malware-like behaviors or malicious data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a configuration setup for quantum circuit parameters with validation checks. It does not contain any malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or malware behavior. The code appears safe and intended for legitimate use within a quantum computing framework.",
