  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration module for quantum algorithms. It contains no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and poses no security risks. The high risk score in one report (0.95) is unjustified and should be lowered to 0.1 or 0, as the code does not perform any operations that could compromise security."
