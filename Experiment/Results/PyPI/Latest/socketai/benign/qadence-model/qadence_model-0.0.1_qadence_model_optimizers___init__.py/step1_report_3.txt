{
  "purpose": "This code defines an __all__ list for module exports, facilitating organized namespace management for quantum-related functions and classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.qfi and .qng)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks, as there are no functions handling untrusted input or output",
  "flows": "Import statements bring in functions/classes; __all__ defines module export behavior; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports specific functions and classes from local modules and specifies them for external use. There are no indications of malicious code, dynamic execution, or suspicious activity. The import statements reference internal modules, and the __all__ list manages namespace exports. The code lacks any data handling, network activity, or other behaviors that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module that exports specific classes and functions for quantum computing purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment.",
