{
  "purpose": "Organize and expose specific quantum computing functions/classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.qfi and .qng).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import from internal modules to namespace exposure via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for Python package modules.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ list, serving as a namespace aggregator. There are no data flows, dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python module that imports and exposes functions/classes related to quantum computing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
