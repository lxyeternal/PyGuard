{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions and classes from local modules for quantum computing applications and exposes them via the __all__ list for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.qfi and .qng)",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data is processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely imports and exposes functions/classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import and export declarations",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and consists solely of import statements and a definition of __all__ to specify exported symbols. There are no dynamic code executions, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious operations. The imported modules are likely part of the same package, and nothing suggests malicious intent. The code structure aligns with standard Python package practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard import and export operations within a Python package. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
