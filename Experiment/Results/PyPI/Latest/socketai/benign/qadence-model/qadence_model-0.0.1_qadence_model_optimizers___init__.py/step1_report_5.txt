  "purpose": "Define module exports and import specific functions/classes related to quantum Fisher information and natural gradient methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements for functions from local modules (.qfi, .qng).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Imported functions/classes are available for use within the module; no data flow to untrusted sources or sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and typical for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific functions/classes from local modules and defines the __all__ list for namespace exports. No untrusted data input, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns. The structure and content are consistent with standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no indications of malicious intent. It serves as a standard module initializer, exposing specific functions/classes for external use.",
