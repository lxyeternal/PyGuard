  "purpose": "This code defines exports for a quantum computing package, specifically exporting quantum Fisher information functions and a natural gradient class.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (.qfi and .qng).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; purely module imports and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only imports and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of imports and an __all__ declaration. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from internal modules and exposes them via the __all__ list for external use. There are no user inputs, external data sources, or network communications. The structure is simple and typical for Python package modules. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears benign, serving solely to organize and expose module components. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
