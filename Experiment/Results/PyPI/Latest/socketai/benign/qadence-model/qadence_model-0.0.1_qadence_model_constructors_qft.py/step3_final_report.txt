  "purpose": "Implementation of various Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) circuits with multiple strategies, including digital, sDAQC, bDAQC, and analog approaches.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as n_qubits, support, strategy; external functions like daqc_transform; imported modules and constants.",
  "sinks": "Constructed circuit objects; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Parameters influence circuit construction; external functions like daqc_transform are called but not exposed to untrusted data flows; no data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder functions for bDAQC and analog layers raise NotImplementedError, which is typical for incomplete features; no suspicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs quantum circuits for QFT using standard gates and mathematical operations. No malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage indicators are present. External dependencies such as daqc_transform could be a potential attack vector if malicious, but no evidence supports this. The code is clear, well-structured, and relies on standard practices. Placeholder functions indicate incomplete features but are not malicious. No network, file, or system calls are present. The overall design aligns with legitimate quantum circuit implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of quantum Fourier Transform circuits supporting multiple strategies. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. External dependencies are noted but not inherently suspicious. The overall security risk is very low, primarily due to incomplete features and reliance on external functions whose internal security cannot be verified here.",
