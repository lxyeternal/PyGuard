{
  "purpose": "Define functions to construct Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) circuits using various strategies (digital, sDAQC, bDAQC, analog) with configurable parameters.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, functions, constants, and variables; functions reading parameters (support, strategy, gen_build); no external data inputs; no user input or network calls.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external system interactions; no network communication, file access, or system commands; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Parameter inputs to functions are used to build quantum circuit representations; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code segments. Functions like _qft_layer_bDAQC and _qft_layer_analog raise NotImplementedError, indicating placeholders but not malicious intent. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides implementation for quantum circuit construction, specifically for QFT with multiple strategies. It includes typical functions with well-structured logic, assertions, and error handling. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The code appears to be legitimate, focusing solely on quantum circuit generation. The presence of NotImplementedError functions suggests incomplete features but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for quantum circuit design, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is safe and intended for quantum circuit simulation or compilation. No security risks are apparent.",
