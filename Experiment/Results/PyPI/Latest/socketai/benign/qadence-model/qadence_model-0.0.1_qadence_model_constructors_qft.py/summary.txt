  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of quantum Fourier Transform circuits supporting multiple strategies. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. External dependencies are noted but not inherently suspicious. The overall security risk is very low, primarily due to incomplete features and reliance on external functions whose internal security cannot be verified here."
