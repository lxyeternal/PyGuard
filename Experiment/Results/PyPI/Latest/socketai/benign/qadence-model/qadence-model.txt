The scores assigned in the critical reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The risk score should be lowered from high values to a minimal level (e.g., 0.1) to reflect the benign nature of the code."

No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. External dependencies are noted but not inherently suspicious. The overall security risk is very low, primarily due to incomplete features and reliance on external functions whose internal security cannot be verified here."
