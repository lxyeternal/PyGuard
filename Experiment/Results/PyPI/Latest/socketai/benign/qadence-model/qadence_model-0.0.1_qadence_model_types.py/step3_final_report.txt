  "purpose": "Define enumerations for basis sets, scaling methods, and Fisher approximation techniques used in quantum feature maps.",
  "sources": "Static enum definitions; no external data input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three enum classes inheriting from StrEnum, each with descriptive docstrings and string values. It is syntactically correct, with no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities. The reports provided are empty, indicating no identified issues or concerns. Given the simplicity and static nature of the code, there are no security risks or malicious behaviors present. The lack of detailed reports prevents any further suspicion or analysis beyond confirming code safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free from malicious intent or obfuscation. The empty reports do not suggest any vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Scores should be set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and overall risk, reflecting a safe and non-malicious code snippet.",
