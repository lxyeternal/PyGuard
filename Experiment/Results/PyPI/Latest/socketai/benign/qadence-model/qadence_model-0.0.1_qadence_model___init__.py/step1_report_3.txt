{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically imports submodules of a package and consolidates their __all__ attributes into a namespace list.",
  "sources": "import_module function import; access to __all__ attribute of each submodule.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or external data flow; only internal module attributes are accessed.",
  "flows": "import_module retrieves submodules; __all__ is accessed and appended to the namespace list.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; standard dynamic import pattern, proper use of __all__ for namespace control.",
  "analysis": "The code uses importlib.import_module to import submodules within a package context and then accesses their __all__ attributes to build a consolidated list of public functions. This pattern is typical for dynamic namespace management. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or obfuscated logic. The code relies on the correctness of __all__ in submodules, which is a common practice. No external data handling or potentially malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard implementation for aggregating public functions from submodules into a package namespace. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident.",
