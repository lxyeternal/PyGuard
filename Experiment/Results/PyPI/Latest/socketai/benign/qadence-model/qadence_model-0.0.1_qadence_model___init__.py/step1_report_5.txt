{
  "purpose": "Dynamically imports specified submodules and aggregates their '__all__' attributes into the module's '__all__' list for namespace management.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the list 'list_of_submodules' and uses 'import_module' to load submodules from 'qadence_model' package, then accesses their '__all__' attributes.",
  "sinks": "The 'import_module' function is used to dynamically import modules based on predefined strings; no direct untrusted input is used.",
  "flows": "The code takes static module names from a list, imports these modules, retrieves their '__all__' attributes, and adds them to the current module's '__all__' list.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on predefined, static module names; no runtime input or external user data influences the import process, reducing risk of malicious injection.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules listed in 'list_of_submodules' using 'import_module' with a fixed package name. It then retrieves each module's '__all__' attribute and appends it to the local '__all__' list. This pattern is typical for building a package namespace and does not involve executing untrusted code or handling untrusted data. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present. The overall approach appears to be a straightforward, static namespace setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace import aggregation using fixed module names and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for package initialization.",
