{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports specified submodules from the 'qadence_model' package and aggregates their '__all__' attributes into the module's own '__all__' list, facilitating namespace management.",
  "sources": "The list_of_submodules array, which contains static strings representing submodule paths; the import_module function call that loads each submodule; the getattr function retrieving the '__all__' attribute from each submodule.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only performs static imports and attribute access without executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "The code iterates over each submodule in list_of_submodules, imports it via import_module, retrieves its '__all__' attribute with getattr, and appends it to the main '__all__' list, establishing a controlled namespace aggregation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code uses standard library functions and static lists without dynamic or hidden operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward, static import of predefined submodules, accesses their '__all__' attributes, and consolidates these into the module's '__all__'. It relies on explicit, controlled strings and standard library functions, with no external inputs, code execution, or network activity. The pattern is common in Python package design for namespace management and poses no security risks. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation for managing module exports in a Python package. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior, and the reports accurately reflect this. No modifications to the scores or assessments are necessary.",
