{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports submodules of a package and aggregates their __all__ attributes into the package's __all__ list, facilitating modular exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements, getattr with import_module to access __all__ of submodules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data in submodule __all__ attributes (though unlikely in this context).",
  "flows": "import_module loads submodules -> getattr retrieves __all__ -> __all__ list is extended.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and attribute retrieval is generally safe here, but the code relies on submodules defining __all__ properly. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns. No external input is processed at runtime.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specified submodules of 'qadence_model', then retrieves their __all__ attribute to build a combined __all__ list for the package. The approach is standard for modular package exports and involves no user input or external data sources. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. It simply manages namespace exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward and standard dynamic import pattern for Python packages. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indications. It appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
