{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports submodules of 'qadence_model', retrieves their '__all__' attribute, and aggregates these into the module's own '__all__' for namespace exports.",
  "sources": "The submodules listed in 'list_of_submodules' ('.constructors', '.optimizers') are imported using import_module, and their '__all__' attributes are accessed.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this code; no data is sent over networks, written to files, or executed as code.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules based on static list, retrieves their '__all__' attributes, and concatenates them into the module's '__all__'.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs dynamic imports based on static list; however, the list is explicitly defined, reducing risk. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing 'annotations' and 'import_module'. It defines a list of submodules and initializes an empty '__all__'. It then iterates through each submodule, imports it relative to 'qadence_model', and extends '__all__' with the submodule's '__all__' attribute. There are no user inputs or external data sources involved; the process is static and explicit. This is a common pattern for namespace aggregation. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code does not execute any untrusted code or perform any network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward namespace aggregator for submodules within 'qadence_model'. It employs standard Python import techniques without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious intent. It appears safe and typical for modular package design.",
