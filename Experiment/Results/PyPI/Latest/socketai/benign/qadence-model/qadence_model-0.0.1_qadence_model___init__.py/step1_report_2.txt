{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports specified submodules within the 'qadence_model' package and aggregates their '__all__' attributes into the module's namespace, facilitating automatic namespace management.",
  "sources": "The list_of_submodules array defines the submodules to be imported; the import_module function is used to import each submodule; getattr retrieves the '__all__' attribute from each submodule.",
  "sinks": "There are no typical sink points such as executing untrusted code or handling external input data; the code only performs controlled imports and attribute aggregation.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the list_of_submodules array to import_module for each submodule, then retrieves '__all__' via getattr, and appends the results to __all__.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns. The code uses standard library functions in a predictable way.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules based on predefined names and gathers their '__all__' attributes to build a combined list for namespace exposure. This is a standard pattern for managing package exports. No untrusted input is involved, and the approach relies on the assumption that the submodules and their '__all__' attributes are secure and properly defined. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard, safe operation for dynamically managing module exports. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical implementation for modular package design.",
