  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a quantum natural gradient optimizer. It contains no malicious or obfuscated features, and the security risk is minimal. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose."
