{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to send HTML-formatted emails via SMTP with support for multiple recipients, CC, and BCC.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the function parameters 'to', 'subject', 'content', 'cc', and 'bcc'. SMTP server configuration details are provided during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The email message is constructed and sent through the smtplib.SMTP_SSL 'send_message' method. Sensitive data like SMTP credentials are used in the process.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into email message creation, which then flows into SMTP connection and sending functions. Credentials flow from class initialization to SMTP login.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded SMTP server, port, username, and password in the main execution block. No obfuscation detected. No unusual or suspicious code structures. The password is exposed in the code, which is a security risk.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for sending emails via SMTP over SSL. It uses proper SSL context for secure communication. The credentials are hardcoded in the script, which is a security concern. No evidence of malicious behaviors like data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activities are present. The email content is provided as a parameter and not generated or manipulated maliciously. The use of 'print' statements is for debugging or informational purposes only. Overall, the code appears to be a typical email-sending utility with poor credential management but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward email sender with hardcoded credentials, which poses a security risk but does not show signs of malicious behavior or malware. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The primary concern is credential exposure, not malicious activity.",
