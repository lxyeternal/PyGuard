{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to send HTML-formatted emails through an SMTP server, supporting multiple recipients, CC, and BCC.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken from function parameters: 'to', 'subject', 'content', 'cc', and 'bcc'. SMTP server details and credentials are provided during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The email is sent via smtplib.SMTP_SSL, which is an external network operation that transmits email data, including potentially sensitive content and recipient addresses.",
  "flows": "Source: email details from function parameters and class attributes -> Processing: email message creation, SMTP connection, login -> Sink: sending email via SMTP_SSL connection.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded SMTP server, port, username, and password; inclusion of credentials in code; no obfuscation of sensitive data. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely constructs an email with HTML content, establishes an SSL-encrypted connection to an SMTP server, and sends the email. The credentials are hardcoded, which is a security concern, but no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or backdoors is present. No suspicious network activity or malicious code snippets are detected. The code's structure is straightforward and aligns with standard email-sending procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate email-sending functions with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The primary security concern is the hardcoded credentials, which could be exploited if leaked, but the code itself does not contain malicious actions.",
