  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .core, .data_process, .vector_database",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data processing or external communication present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; simple re-exports",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) which can obscure the origin of imported names and potentially hide malicious code within modules",
  "analysis": "The code only performs relative imports from other modules within the package and sets the __all__ attribute for module exports. The use of wildcard imports is generally discouraged as it can import unintended or malicious code if the modules contain such, but the snippet itself does not include any malicious code or behavior. There are no external data sources, no network operations, and no credential handling. The code is minimal and appears to serve a modular interface purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module aggregator with no direct malicious activity; however, the use of wildcard imports warrants caution because it can potentially import malicious code if the internal modules are compromised. Overall, the code itself does not contain malicious behavior but should be reviewed in the context of its imported modules.",
