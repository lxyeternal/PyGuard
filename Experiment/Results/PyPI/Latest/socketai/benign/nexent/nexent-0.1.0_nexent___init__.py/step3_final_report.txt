  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*), which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if modules are compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module imports with wildcard syntax, common in __init__.py files for re-exporting. No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. Wildcard imports can pose security risks if the imported modules are malicious or compromised, as they may introduce unintended symbols or backdoors. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions suggest a benign intent, but the import method warrants caution. The overall structure aligns with typical package initialization patterns, and no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer with standard import patterns. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which could be exploited if the imported modules are malicious. Given the evidence, the code itself is safe, but the import practice should be reviewed in trusted environments. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero; the security risk score is low (~0.2) due to import practices.",
