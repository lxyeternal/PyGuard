{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules from the current package and defines public API components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .core, .data_process, .vector_database.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data processing or output operations are performed.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only imports modules and sets __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of relative imports without additional context appears normal; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules and the definition of the __all__ list. There is no dynamic execution, no handling of untrusted input, nor any network or file operations. The structure is standard for package __init__.py files intended to re-export modules. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward package initialization script with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply re-exports modules for public use without any suspicious logic.",
