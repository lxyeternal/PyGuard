{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules from the same package and defines an __all__ attribute for module exports, likely for a Python package's initialization or interface setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module imports from the current package, specifically from .core, .data_process, and .vector_database.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks or untrusted data handling in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are apparent within this minimal code, as it only performs module imports and defines exported symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements and an export list; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package __init__.py style module that imports internal modules and defines __all__ for exports. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious code injection, or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any network operations, data handling, or other potentially malicious actions. The structure and syntax are typical for a Python package initializer.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this code snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard package initialization file.",
