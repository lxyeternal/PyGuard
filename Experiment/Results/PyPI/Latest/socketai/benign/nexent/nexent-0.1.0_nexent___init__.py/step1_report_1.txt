{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to import all contents from three local modules (core, data_process, vector_database) and to define the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .core, .data_process, .vector_database",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present in this code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and sets __all__",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) can obscure what is imported, but it is a common practice in package init files and not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports entire modules using relative imports and defines an explicit __all__ list to specify public API components. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The use of wildcard imports can sometimes hide malicious imports or code but is typical in package __init__.py files for convenience. There is no indication of any data processing, network activity, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package initialization script with no malicious intent. The use of wildcard imports is typical but not suspicious in this context. No security risks or malware indicators are detected.",
