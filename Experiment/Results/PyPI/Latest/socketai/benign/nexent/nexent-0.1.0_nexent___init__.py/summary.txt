  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer with standard import patterns. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which could be exploited if the imported modules are malicious. Given the evidence, the code itself is safe, but the import practice should be reviewed in trusted environments. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero; the security risk score is low (~0.2) due to import practices."
