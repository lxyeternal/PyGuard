  "purpose": "Re-exporting modules 'core', 'data_process', and 'vector_database' for public use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .core, .data_process, .vector_database.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or external interactions; only module imports and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only imports and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports all contents from three local modules and defines an __all__ list for exports. There are no indications of data handling, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a standard module initialization pattern with no external inputs or outputs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module re-export pattern with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It functions as a simple index module to organize exports.",
