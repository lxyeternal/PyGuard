{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for a set of search and email tools, facilitating their import and use in other parts of a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for various local modules: bocha_search_tool, exa_search_tool, knowledge_base_search_tool, summary_tool, send_email_tool, get_email_tool.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only imports modules and defines exports. No untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports without executing runtime logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs observed. The code appears standard for setting up a Python module's exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules related to search and email functionalities and exposes them via the __all__ variable. There are no dynamic code executions, external network calls, or suspicious behaviors. The structure is typical for Python package modules, and it doesn't contain obfuscated or malicious code. All elements are straightforward and consistent with standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign, serving as part of a larger, standard application structure.",
