{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python module that imports several local classes and exposes them via the __all__ list for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports from local files and the __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module setup, importing local classes and defining __all__. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to common Python practices suggest it is benign. The security risk score should be zero, as there are no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The malware score is also zero, given the absence of malicious code. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is slightly cautious but acceptable, considering potential risks from imported modules outside this snippet. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python module export pattern with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a slight overcautiousness in the security risk score in some cases. Overall, the code is safe and does not warrant concern.",
