{
  "purpose": "The code defines module imports and exports for various search and email tools, likely to be used in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .bocha_search_tool, .exa_search_tool, .knowledge_base_search_tool, .summary_tool, .send_email_tool, .get_email_tool.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code only imports and exports symbols. Potential risk depends on how these modules are implemented and used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Data flow cannot be fully determined from this snippet alone. This code mainly establishes interface exposure without handling data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed in this snippet. It is straightforward module import/export code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of importing several modules and defining an __all__ list for module exports. It does not contain any input handling, data processing, or network operations. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present. The simplicity indicates standard module setup, with no evident security issues or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module import/export setup with no malicious behavior detected. It does not perform any suspicious actions or contain security risks by itself. Its safety depends on the implementation of the imported modules, which are not shown here.",
