  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for various search and email tools, likely part of a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules (.bocha_search_tool, .exa_search_tool, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication in this code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; import statements do not process untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple classes from local modules and specifies them in __all__ for export. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated code, or data handling. The modules' internal implementations are not shown, so potential malicious behavior within those modules cannot be assessed. However, the current snippet is straightforward and does not demonstrate malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module initialization file setting up exports for various tools. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this snippet.",
