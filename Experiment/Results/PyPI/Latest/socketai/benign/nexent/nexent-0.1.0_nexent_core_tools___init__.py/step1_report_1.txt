  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for a set of search and email tools, likely part of a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .bocha_search_tool, .exa_search_tool, .knowledge_base_search_tool, .summary_tool, .send_email_tool, .get_email_tool.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential data leak points are explicitly visible in this snippet; it mainly involves importing and exporting classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are apparent in this code snippet; it only imports and exposes classes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no apparent anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors. The code structure appears standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple classes from local modules and declares an __all__ list for exports, typical for Python packages. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated or unusual language features are used. The snippet is straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module export configuration for a set of tools. There is no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a benign and typical structure for organizing package exports.",
