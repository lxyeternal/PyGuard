{
  "purpose": "This code implements a summary tool that processes user queries and search results to generate a formatted summary response using an LLM model.",
  "sources": "User input 'query', search results list 'search_result', system prompt string, model messages (constructed from user input and system prompt)",
  "sinks": "Model invocation which processes messages, and the returned content being output as the final answer",
  "flows": "User input and search results are concatenated and included in messages sent to the LLM model; the model's response content is returned",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual dynamic code execution patterns observed. No external network connections, backdoors, or data leaks identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for a summarization tool that takes user queries and search results, constructs a prompt with system instructions, and invokes an LLM model to generate a response. The implementation is straightforward, using typical method calls and string concatenation. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The only potential concern is the handling of model outputs, but it is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage within this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a prompt-based summarization tool utilizing an LLM model. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. The overall security risk score is low.",
