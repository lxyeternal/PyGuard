{
  "purpose": "The code defines a summary tool class that uses an OpenAI language model to generate summarized responses based on search results and user queries.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'query' (user question) and 'search_result' (list of search result strings). The system prompt string is also a source.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'self.model(messages=messages)' sends data to the language model API; potential risk if the model or its API is compromised. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The user query and search results flow into the prompt construction, which is then passed as input to the language model API call.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No evidence of obfuscated code or malicious behavior. The prompt content is standard for a summarization task.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a system prompt and user message containing search results and query, then calls an external language model API to generate output. It does not process untrusted data beyond standard input handling, and there are no unsafe operations or malicious behaviors. The API call depends on the 'self.model' object, assumed to be a properly implemented model interface. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation of a summarization tool leveraging a language model API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within the provided code.",
