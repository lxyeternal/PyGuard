{
  "purpose": "This code implements a summary tool that uses an OpenAI language model to generate formatted summaries based on user queries and search results.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input 'query' and 'search_result' parameters, and constructs messages to send to the language model.",
  "sinks": "The language model receives the constructed message, which contains concatenated search results and user query; the output is generated by the model based on this input.",
  "flows": "User inputs ('query' and 'search_result') are concatenated and embedded into messages sent to the language model; the model's response content is returned as output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns detected. The concatenation of search results and user query is straightforward. No external network calls or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a tool class for summarization that takes user queries and search results, constructs a message with system prompt and user data, and passes it to an OpenAI model. The process appears to be a standard prompt-engineering approach without malicious or suspicious behavior. The concatenation of search results is simple and directly used in the prompt. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware. The system prompt is a static string used to instruct the model on output formatting. The overall design is typical for a language model-based summarization task with no evident security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a summarization tool using a language model. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It functions as intended within the context of an LLM-based application.",
