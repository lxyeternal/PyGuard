{
  "purpose": "Constructs a prompt from user query and search results, then uses an external language model to generate a summary response.",
  "sources": "Concatenation of search result strings, user query input, message construction for model input.",
  "sinks": "Model invocation with untrusted input; no direct data leaks or insecure operations observed.",
  "flows": "Search results and query are concatenated and embedded into a message, which is sent to the model; model response is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a prompt-based summarization tool. It concatenates search results, constructs a message with a static system prompt, and invokes an external language model. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk scores around 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The process relies on external API calls, which is standard, and handles untrusted input without additional security measures, but this is typical for such applications. Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard prompt construction and API invocation for a summarization utility. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behavior is evident. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
