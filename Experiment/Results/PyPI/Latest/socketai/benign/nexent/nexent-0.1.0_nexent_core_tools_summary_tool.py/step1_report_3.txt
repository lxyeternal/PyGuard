{
  "purpose": "Define a summary tool class that uses an LLM to generate summaries based on user queries and search results.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'query' and 'search_result'; 'search_result' elements; 'messages' list construction.",
  "sinks": "Passing 'messages' to the language model; returning 'model_output_message.content'.",
  "flows": "User input 'query' and 'search_result' -> Construction of 'messages' list -> Passed to LLM model -> Output 'content' returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code primarily manages data flow and model invocation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for a summarization tool, initializing with an LLM and system prompt. It concatenates search results into a string and constructs message objects for the model input. The model's response is returned as the output. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious operations are evident. Usage of external models and simple string manipulations are standard. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation of a summarization utility utilizing an LLM. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The design is straightforward and aligns with typical application code for AI services.",
