{
  "purpose": "A knowledge base search tool that queries internal or proprietary documents via HTTP POST requests and formats the results for further processing.",
  "sources": "HTTP POST request to the specified URL with index names and query; reading JSON response from the server.",
  "sinks": "Processing of JSON response data; formatting search results into message objects; optional logging via observer.",
  "flows": "Input query -> POST request to external URL -> JSON response -> parse results -> format into message objects -> return results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of localhost URL is typical for development but should be configurable for production.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard HTTP-based search operation, with proper error handling and data formatting. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. External URL is configurable, reducing risk. No obfuscation or backdoors are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.2), justified by the use of localhost URL which could be misconfigured in production but is not inherently risky.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured internal knowledge base search utility with no malicious intent or sabotage. The scores are appropriate and justified, with minimal security risk primarily related to deployment configuration rather than code flaws.",
