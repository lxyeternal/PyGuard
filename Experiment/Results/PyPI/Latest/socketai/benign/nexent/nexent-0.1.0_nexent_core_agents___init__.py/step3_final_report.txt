  "purpose": "This code serves as a module interface, importing CoreAgent from a local module and exposing it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .code_agent import CoreAgent reads the CoreAgent class from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks involving untrusted data, external communication, or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The code only imports CoreAgent and exports it; no data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import and export pattern typical in Python modules. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the lack of suspicious features. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident. The code's simplicity and clarity support a conclusion of no security risk or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a module interface. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
