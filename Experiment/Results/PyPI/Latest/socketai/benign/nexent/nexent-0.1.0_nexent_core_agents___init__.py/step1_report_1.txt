{
  "purpose": "The code exports the CoreAgent class from the local module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.code_agent). No external data input observed.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from source to sink within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; very minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement and an export list, indicating module exposure. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or sensitive operations. Given the simplicity, there are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. The import from a relative module (.code_agent) is typical for package structure, with no signs of hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be a standard module export statement with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It simply makes the CoreAgent class available for other modules.",
