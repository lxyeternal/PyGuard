  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that re-exports a class named CoreAgent from a local package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing CoreAgent from a local module .code_agent",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code only contains an import and an export list",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal; no unusual or suspicious patterns are evident. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a relative module and defines __all__ for export. There are no data processing, user input, or network operations. No obfuscation, malware behavior, or security risks are observable in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module re-export with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves as a simple wrapper or interface for the CoreAgent class.",
