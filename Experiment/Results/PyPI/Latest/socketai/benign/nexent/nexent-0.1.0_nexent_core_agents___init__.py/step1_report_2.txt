  "purpose": "The code exports the CoreAgent class for external use, likely as part of a package or module related to code or AI agent functionality.",
  "sources": "The only source is the import statement from .code_agent import CoreAgent, which reads the CoreAgent class definition from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or external data; the code only imports and exports a class.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable as there are no runtime data processing or untrusted inputs involved in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class and defines __all__ for export. There is no processing, data handling, or network activity. It appears to be a standard module setup with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and typical for a Python package module. No malicious behavior, security issues, or anomalies are detected.",
