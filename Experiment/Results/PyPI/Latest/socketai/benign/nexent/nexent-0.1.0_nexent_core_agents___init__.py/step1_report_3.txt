{
  "purpose": "The code exports the CoreAgent class from the local module code_agent, indicating it is part of a package interface.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .code_agent",
  "sinks": "None detected",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only imports and exports a class",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; simple import and export statement, no suspicious or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named CoreAgent from a local module. It then explicitly exports this class in the __all__ list for module interface purposes. There are no dynamic code executions, data inputs, or network interactions. The code appears to be a straightforward module definition with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a simple interface declaration for the CoreAgent class. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected in this snippet.",
