{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports and lazy-loading functions for core components and models, likely in a larger application framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads from its own module imports and the local functions get_core_agent() and get_openai_model().",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain external data sinks or untrusted data flows; it primarily manages internal module references.",
  "flows": "No external data flow from sources to sinks; lazy import functions defer module loading, but do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lazy imports to avoid circular dependencies is a common pattern; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from sibling modules, defines an __all__ list for exports, and includes functions for lazy importing of CoreAgent and OpenAIModel. These functions import modules at runtime to prevent circular dependencies. No untrusted data input, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code structure is typical for Python packages managing module dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a module index with lazy loading functions to prevent circular dependencies. It does not contain malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears benign and standard in design.",
