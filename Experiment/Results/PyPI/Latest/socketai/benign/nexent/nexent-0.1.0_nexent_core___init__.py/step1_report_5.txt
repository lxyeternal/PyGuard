{
  "purpose": "This code module primarily re-exports classes and functions for easier access and defines lazy import functions to prevent circular dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.utils.observer, .tools, .agents, .models).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and lazy import functions, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Lazy import functions (get_core_agent and get_openai_model) may delay the actual import, but this is a common pattern to avoid circular dependencies; no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining imports and re-exports, with functions that defer imports to avoid circular references. No user input handling, no network operations, and no suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard pattern for organizing imports in a Python package to manage dependencies, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
