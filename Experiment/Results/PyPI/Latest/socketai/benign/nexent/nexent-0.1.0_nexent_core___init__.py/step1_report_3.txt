{
  "purpose": "Module that exports specific classes and functions, with lazy imports to prevent circular dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements at the beginning of the code; lazy import functions 'get_core_agent' and 'get_openai_model'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no direct untrusted data handling or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Imports and lazy import functions, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lazy import functions to avoid circular dependencies is a common pattern, no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module exports and employs lazy importing to handle circular dependencies. There are no hardcoded secrets, external data handling, or malicious constructs. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be standard module setup with deferred imports for modular design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module setup with lazy imports, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a benign, well-structured piece of code intended for organizing imports.",
