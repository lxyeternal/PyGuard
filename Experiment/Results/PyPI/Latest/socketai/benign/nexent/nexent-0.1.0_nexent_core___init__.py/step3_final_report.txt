  "purpose": "Module initialization with exports and lazy imports to avoid circular dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements and functions get_core_agent() and get_openai_model() performing lazy imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely structural code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; functions only perform internal imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python patterns for module exports and circular dependency management. All imports are internal, with no external data, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The lazy import functions are common practice, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and structure indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured module setup with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
