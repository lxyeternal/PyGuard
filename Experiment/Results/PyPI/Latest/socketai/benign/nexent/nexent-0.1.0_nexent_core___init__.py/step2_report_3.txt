  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking their reasoning, the code, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a typical package setup, exposing classes and tools, with lazy imports to avoid circular dependencies.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or untrusted data flows are present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is detected.\n- The code structure is standard for modular Python packages.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes:** None are evident; the code follows common patterns.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** All are very low or zero, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Claims based on assumptions:** No unfounded claims are made; the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- The use of lazy imports is standard for avoiding circular dependencies; no malicious intent.\n- No external inputs or outputs, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n- The code is purely structural and organizational.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk should all remain at 0, as no evidence suggests otherwise.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their evaluation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nBased on this review, I concur with the provided reports' conclusions. The code is benign, well-structured, and free of security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis confirms that the code snippet is safe and standard for its purpose.",
