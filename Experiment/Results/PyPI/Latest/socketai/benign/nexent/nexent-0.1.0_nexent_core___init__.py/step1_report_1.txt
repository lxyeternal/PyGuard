{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a package's initialization, exposing certain classes and tools for external use and providing lazy import functions to avoid circular dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.utils.observer, .tools, .agents, .models), which are static within the package structure.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data sources or data sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code defines functions that import modules at runtime; no data flows from external sources to critical functions are observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lazy imports within functions is unusual but common in avoiding circular dependencies; no suspicious code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up module exports for certain classes and tools, with functions to lazily load modules to prevent circular dependencies. No external inputs, no suspicious or malicious code, and no obfuscated patterns are present. The code structure is typical for modular Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization pattern with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attack, or security risks. The use of lazy imports is a benign pattern to handle dependencies.",
