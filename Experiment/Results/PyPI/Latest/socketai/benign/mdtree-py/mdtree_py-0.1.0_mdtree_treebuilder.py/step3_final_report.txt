  "purpose": "Builds a directory tree visualization, respecting ignore patterns and .gitignore, for directory structure analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input path, reads .gitignore file, reads ignore list, filesystem directory contents.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, no network activity, no external system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input path validation -> directory traversal -> ignore pattern matching -> output string assembly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard path validation, reads ignore patterns including from .gitignore, constructs ignore specifications, and recursively traverses directories respecting max depth and ignore rules. It uses 'pathspec' correctly for pattern matching. No external communication, code injection, or malicious operations are present. The logic is straightforward, well-structured, and employs common libraries and patterns for directory listing and ignore handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, transparent directory tree visualization utility with ignore pattern support. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The current scores are appropriate, except the high security risk score in Report 1 which should be lowered. Overall, the code is benign and secure.",
