{
  "purpose": "The code exports functions from a module named 'treebuilder', likely for building and validating structure trees or paths.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from a local module '.treebuilder'. It does not read external input or data directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or cause data leaks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with standard import and export statements; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code solely re-exports two functions from a local module, which is a common pattern for module organization. It does not include any logic that could be malicious, nor does it handle external inputs or perform operations that could lead to security issues. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as an interface or facade to functions in another module. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
