  "purpose": "Exports functions 'build_structure_tree' and 'validate_and_convert_path' from the local module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions from a relative module '.treebuilder'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or sinks present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only involves import and export definitions with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code; no suspicious or unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports two functions from a local module and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure. There are no inputs, data processing, or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The code structure is standard for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign and typical for a Python package's module export file. No malicious intent or security risks are detected based on the provided snippet.",
