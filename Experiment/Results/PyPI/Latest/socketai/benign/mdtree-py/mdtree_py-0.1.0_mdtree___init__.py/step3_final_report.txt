  "purpose": "Re-export functions from the local module 'treebuilder' for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .treebuilder module.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import of functions from .treebuilder to module exports via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal, straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a local module and defines __all__ to specify exports. It contains no data processing, input/output, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code is a standard pattern for Python module exports, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are justified based on its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module re-export with no security concerns. The reports accurately assess its safety, and no modifications are necessary.",
