  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling observed; no untrusted data processing or output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only performs an import and export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a local module and defines __all__ to specify exports. There is no data processing, input handling, or output generation. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The structure is simple, adhering to standard Python module conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export declaration with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies detected. It simply exposes two functions from a local module.",
