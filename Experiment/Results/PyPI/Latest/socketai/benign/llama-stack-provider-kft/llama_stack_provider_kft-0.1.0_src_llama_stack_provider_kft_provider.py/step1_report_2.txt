  "purpose": "Define a function that returns a provider specification for post-training inference, including configuration details and dependencies.",
  "sources": "import statements, function parameters, string literals for adapter_type, pip_packages, config_class, module",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration data without external input or output flows",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; dependencies appear legitimate",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific data types and defines a function that returns a configuration object for a provider specification. The returned object specifies API type, adapter configuration, and a pip package dependency. The package version appears standard and explicitly specified. No external inputs, network operations, or untrusted data are handled. The code is straightforward and contains no obfuscation or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration setup for a machine learning deployment component. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
