  "purpose": "Module setup and re-export of internal components for package API exposure.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.provider, .config, .kft_adapter).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ definition, no data flow or runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module initialization pattern, importing specific classes and functions from internal modules and defining __all__ for public API. It contains no data processing, external communication, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All evidence supports a safe assessment, and no modifications to the scores or analysis are necessary.",
