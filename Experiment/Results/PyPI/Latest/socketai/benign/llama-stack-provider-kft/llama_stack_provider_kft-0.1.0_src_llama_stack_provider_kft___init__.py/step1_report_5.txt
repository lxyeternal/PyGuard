{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes and functions from local modules to define the public API of a package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported modules (.provider, .config, .kft_adapter) for definitions of functions and classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only performs static imports and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing classes/functions from local modules and exposing them via __all__, with no data processing or untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package __init__.py files.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from local modules, likely for packaging purposes, and explicitly defines the public API via __all__. There are no signs of data handling, external communication, or code execution. The structure is typical for Python module initialization files, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script that safely exposes selected classes and functions. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks.",
