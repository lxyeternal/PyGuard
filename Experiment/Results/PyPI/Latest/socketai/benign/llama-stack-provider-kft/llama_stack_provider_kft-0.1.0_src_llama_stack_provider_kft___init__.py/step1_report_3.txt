  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and functions related to a machine learning or data processing pipeline, possibly for configuring or implementing a post-training process with KubeFlow.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .provider, .config, and .kft_adapter, which likely contain functions and classes used within this module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external outputs within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions and classes but does not perform any data flow or processing actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated constructs, are present in this simple import and export setup.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific components and defines an __all__ list for module exports. There are no functions, data processing, or system calls that could pose security risks. It appears to be standard module setup code. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected based on this limited code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module initialization file that imports and exports components for use elsewhere. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
