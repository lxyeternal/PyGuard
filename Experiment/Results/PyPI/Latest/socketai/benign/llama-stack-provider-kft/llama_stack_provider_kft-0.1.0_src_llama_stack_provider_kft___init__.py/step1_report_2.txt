{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and classes from local modules and defines an explicit list of public objects for module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .provider, .config, .kft_adapter",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data handling or external network interactions",
  "flows": "N/A – the code only imports and defines exports without data flow or external data handling",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation observed; the structure appears straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from internal modules, which is typical in Python package structure. The __all__ variable explicitly declares the public API of the module. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns. No external network connections, data handling, or credential management present. The code appears to be standard module setup code with no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import and export setup with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or obfuscation. The module simply re-exports functions and classes, which is typical and benign.",
