{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports for a Python package related to a KubeFlow post-training setup, importing specific functions and classes from internal modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: .provider, .config, .kft_adapter",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no external data or untrusted input handling observed",
  "flows": "Imports source modules; exports functions and classes via __all__ list",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code behavior; purely import/export statements",
  "analysis": "The code only performs module imports and defines the __all__ export list. There are no input reading, data processing, or sink operations. The imports are from relative internal modules, indicating typical package structure. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script defining exports. There are no indicators of malicious activity or security risks within this code segment.",
