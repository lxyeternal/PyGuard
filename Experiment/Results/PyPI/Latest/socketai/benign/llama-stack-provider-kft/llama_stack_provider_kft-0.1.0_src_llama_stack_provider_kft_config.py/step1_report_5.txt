{
  "purpose": "Defines a configuration model for a Kubeflow post-training job, including resource specifications and parameters.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, especially default values and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or data output to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is primarily a static data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic BaseModel with configuration parameters for a Kubeflow job. All attributes are static or defaulted, with no user input processing, no external data handling, and no network or system calls present. The sample_run_config method returns an empty dictionary and does not perform any dynamic operations or code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or security issues. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration data class intended for parameter passing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration class for a machine learning pipeline without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious data flows.",
