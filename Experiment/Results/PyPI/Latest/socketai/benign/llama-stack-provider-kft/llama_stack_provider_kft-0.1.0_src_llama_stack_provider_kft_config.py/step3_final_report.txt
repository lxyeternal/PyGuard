  "purpose": "Defines configuration parameters for Kubernetes-based ML training jobs using Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions with default values; no external data input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a declarative data model with default values, serving as a configuration schema. The sample_run_config method is a placeholder returning an empty dict. No external data handling, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The code's structure and content are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard configuration class with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are justified and appropriate.",
