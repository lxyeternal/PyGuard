  "purpose": "Define a configuration model for a Kubernetes training job setup related to machine learning models, with default parameters and a sample run generator.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, method parameters, default values",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external interactions",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow involving untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior; the code is straightforward and uses standard libraries and patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic BaseModel subclass for configuration parameters related to a Kubernetes-based training setup. All fields are standard configuration parameters with default values, with no indications of data leakage, malicious data handling, or malicious code. The sample_run_config method returns an empty dictionary, serving as a placeholder without performing any actions. There are no external data inputs, no code injection, no suspicious code constructs, and no obfuscated code present. The code appears purely declarative, intended for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration data model with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or unsafe operations. The overall security risk is very low.",
