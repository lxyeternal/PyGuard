  "purpose": "Define a configuration model for a Kubeflow post-training pipeline with default parameters.",
  "sources": "Class attributes with default values, method sample_run_config",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; the method sample_run_config returns an empty dict, which is benign",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic BaseModel class for configuration purposes, listing various parameters related to model training and deployment. All parameters are simple data types with default values; no user input processing or dynamic data handling occurs. The method sample_run_config returns an empty dictionary, suggesting placeholder behavior. No external data reading, environment variable usage, or suspicious code constructs are present. The structure and format are standard for configuration classes, with no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration class with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks identified. It appears to be a normal part of a machine learning deployment pipeline.",
