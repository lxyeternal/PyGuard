  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to perform some data processing or functionality, but without additional context, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, potentially user inputs or configuration files, and possibly from network sources if included later.",
  "sinks": "Uses standard output and file operations; if network code is present, it could transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Data is read from environment variables or input sources, processed through internal functions, and then outputted or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; no suspicious dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "Initial review shows standard Python code structure with typical function definitions and data handling. There are no signs of malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoor mechanisms. Usage of environment variables and input/output functions is common and not inherently malicious. Without additional context or external code, the likelihood of malicious intent appears low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or malware. The code seems benign, focusing on data handling with no suspicious operations or security risks identified.",
