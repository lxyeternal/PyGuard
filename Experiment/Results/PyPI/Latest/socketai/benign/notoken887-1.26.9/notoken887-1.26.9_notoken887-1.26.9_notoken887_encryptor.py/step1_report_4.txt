{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple encoding and decoding functions to transform strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa, acting as a basic obfuscation or cipher.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods, which take a string and an encrypted string, respectively.",
  "sinks": "The functions do not output data to external sources or perform data leaks; they only process strings within memory.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace characters with emojis ('encrypt'); emoji string -> replace emojis with characters ('decrypt').",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward character replacements with no external input validation, no network activity, and no security-sensitive operations. The methods are purely for obfuscation; no secrets, credentials, or environment variables are used or manipulated. No signs of malicious backdoors, code injection, or malicious data exfiltration are present. The replacement patterns are static and predictable, indicating a simple cipher, not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a static, character-by-character substitution cipher using emoji replacements for alphabetic, numeric, and some punctuation characters. Both methods are symmetric, with a predefined mapping. There are no external data sources, no network calls, and no handling of secrets. No obfuscation techniques beyond static replacements are used. The code is straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent or hidden backdoors. The purpose appears to be simple string obfuscation, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of character obfuscation via emoji substitution, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to serve a purpose of hiding or obscuring strings for non-security-critical reasons. No malware behavior or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
