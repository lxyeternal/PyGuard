{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple obfuscation mechanism by replacing characters in strings with emojis for encryption and reversing the process for decryption.",
  "sources": "Input strings passed to the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods.",
  "sinks": "The methods return the transformed strings; no external data sinks are directly involved.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed by the 'encrypt' method where characters are replaced by emojis, and then the 'decrypt' method reverses this process, restoring the original string.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward character substitution without any hidden or malicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The only notable feature is the simple character-to-emoji mapping, which is benign and serves as an obfuscation or encoding method.",
  "analysis": "The class 'TokenCryptor' offers basic character substitution for encoding strings into emojis and decoding back. It does not execute external code, access environment variables, or perform any network operations. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The design is purely for obfuscation, with no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of character substitution for obfuscation purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The structure is straightforward, with no suspicious or hidden functionality.",
