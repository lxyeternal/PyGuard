{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides simple substitution-based encryption and decryption functions for strings using emoji and special characters.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided to the encrypt() and decrypt() methods as string parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or outputs, such as network, file, or system calls, are present.",
  "flows": "Input string is transformed through chained replace() calls in encrypt(); similarly, encrypted data is transformed back in decrypt(). No external data flows or untrusted sources beyond method parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses straightforward string replacements for encryption, which is insecure for cryptographic purposes. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is present. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution observed. The substitution appears to be purely for obfuscation or novelty, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a simple, reversible substitution cipher with emoji mappings, lacking any cryptographic security or external data handling. No external network, file, or environment interaction is observed. The methods are stateless, operating solely on input strings. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code appears to be for encoding/decoding strings with emojis, possibly for aesthetic or obscuring purposes. Overall, the implementation is straightforward with no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-secure substitution cipher implementation with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. It does not interact with external systems or sensitive data. Its use is limited to obfuscating strings, not for cryptographic security. No malware or security threats are identified.",
