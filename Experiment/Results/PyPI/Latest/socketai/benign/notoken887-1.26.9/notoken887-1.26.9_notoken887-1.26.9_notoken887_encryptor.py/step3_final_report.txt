{
  "purpose": "A simple substitution cipher that maps characters to emojis and vice versa for obfuscation or aesthetic purposes.",
  "sources": "Input strings to encrypt or decrypt functions, which are then processed via static string replacements.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or sinks; the code only performs in-memory string replacements.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed to 'encrypt' or 'decrypt' methods, which replace characters with emojis or emojis with characters respectively.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static replacements without obfuscation techniques beyond simple substitution.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a reversible substitution cipher using static emoji mappings for characters, serving as an obfuscation or encoding utility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration. The functions are stateless and purely perform string replacements. The substitution mappings are static and known, with no dynamic or obfuscated code patterns. The code does not handle secrets, credentials, or environment variables. It is benign and primarily aesthetic or for simple obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static substitution cipher intended for obfuscation or aesthetic purposes. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The scoring in the reports is appropriate: malware score of 0, low security risk (~0.1), and minimal obfuscation (~0.2). There is no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
