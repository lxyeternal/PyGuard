{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character replacement encryption and decryption for obfuscation or encoding of strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to the encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data externally or interact with network, files, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace() chain in encrypt() -> output encrypted string; encrypted string -> replace() chain in decrypt() -> output original string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The class only performs character substitutions for encoding/decoding. No external network or system interactions are present. The code is straightforward and does not appear obfuscated or intentionally malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a TokenCryptor class with methods for simple character replacements to encode and decode strings. Both methods use extensive chained replace() calls to swap characters with emojis or symbols, then reverse those replacements. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network access, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation. The implementation is basic and appears to serve as an encoding utility, not malware. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not interact with external systems, does not contain hardcoded secrets, and lacks obfuscation or complex logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign character substitution encoder/decoder. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely for encoding or decoding strings through character replacements, with no side effects or external interactions.",
