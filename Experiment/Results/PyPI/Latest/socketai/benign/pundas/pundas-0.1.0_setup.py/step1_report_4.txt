  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for packaging the 'pundas' Python library.",
  "sources": "Open('README.md').read() which reads the long description from an external markdown file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Read from the README.md file as part of setting long_description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context manager (e.g., with statement) is not best practice but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project using setuptools. It specifies metadata such as name, version, description, author, license, and packages. It reads the long description from README.md without any manipulation or external input processing. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is present. The code appears typical for a Python package setup with no signs of supply chain attacks or malware. The only minor concern is reading a file without a context manager, which does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
