  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pundas', configuring its metadata and packaging options.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content during setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a straightforward setup configuration without any obfuscation or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for package setup. It specifies package metadata such as name, version, description, author details, license, and package discovery. The only file read is 'README.md' for long_description, which is standard practice. There are no dynamic code executions, input processing, or network operations. The structure is typical for Python package setup scripts. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures package metadata and reads a documentation file. The code appears safe and benign.",
