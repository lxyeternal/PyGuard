  "purpose": "A standard Python setup script for packaging the 'pundas' library, defining metadata and reading the README file for long description.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' via open() without a context manager.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A; static metadata assignment with file read operation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without a context manager; no obfuscation or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with static package metadata. It reads 'README.md' directly without a context manager, which is a minor best practice but not a security issue. No dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscated constructs are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores at 0 and very low security risk scores (~0.1) due to minor file handling concern. The code does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, confirming the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor file handling issue does not impact security. The reports' scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
