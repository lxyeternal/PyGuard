{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pundas'. It specifies package metadata and uses setuptools to prepare the package for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from 'README.md' for the long description. Other data (name, version, author info) are hardcoded string literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present. The setup function primarily prepares package metadata and does not execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The only data flow from source to sink involves reading 'README.md' content into 'long_description', which is then used in package metadata. No user input or external data streams are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code performs standard package setup tasks with straightforward, static values.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and configures package setup parameters, including metadata and package discovery. It reads a markdown file for the description but does not process or execute external data beyond this. No code injection, malicious behavior, or obfuscation present. The overall structure and content are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply prepares a package for distribution with predefined metadata.",
