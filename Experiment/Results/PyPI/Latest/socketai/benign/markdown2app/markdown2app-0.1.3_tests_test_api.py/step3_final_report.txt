{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal placeholder or test module, containing only comments and a docstring with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; there are no data flows or external interactions that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present, as the code contains only comments and a docstring.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-executable placeholder with only comments and a docstring. There are no sources, sinks, or data flows. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of logic, external interactions, or embedded code. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the minimal content. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
