  "purpose": "This code appears to serve as a placeholder or documentation comment for a hardware testing module, with no executable logic or data flow.",
  "sources": "Comments and string literal referencing a filename; no input sources or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist due to the absence of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only comments and a string literal, with no executable statements or suspicious patterns; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of comments and a filename string, with no functions, data flows, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this snippet. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the lack of executable or suspicious content. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.95), as the code provides no indication of malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder or documentation comment with no malicious behavior or security issues. All indicators (malware, obfuscation, risk) are correctly scored as zero, and the overall assessment confirms its harmless nature.",
