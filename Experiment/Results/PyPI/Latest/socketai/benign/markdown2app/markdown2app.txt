      "conclusion": "The code is not malicious by itself but provides a highly insecure environment capable of executing arbitrary system commands and code, exposing the system to command injection, data leakage, and system compromise if used with untrusted input. The high scores for malware (~0.8) and security risk (~0.9) are justified. It should be considered unsafe for processing untrusted data without significant modifications such as sandboxing, input validation, and restricting dangerous functions."
