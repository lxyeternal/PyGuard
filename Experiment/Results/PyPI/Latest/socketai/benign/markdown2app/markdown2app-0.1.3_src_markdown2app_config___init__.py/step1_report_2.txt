{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for basic data processing or utility functions, possibly for interacting with external systems or data sources.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as reading from environment variables, files, or user input (if present), and external data sources such as network connections or APIs.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe output operations like writing to files, executing system commands, or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and then to sinks which could lead to data leaks or system compromise if untrusted data is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious imports. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain any malicious payloads or suspicious behaviors. It uses standard Python practices. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity are present. The code appears clean, with no unusual dynamic execution or obfuscated segments. No malicious privacy violations or credential theft identified. The absence of external malicious calls or dangerous data handling suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign and performs routine operations without any malicious intent.",
