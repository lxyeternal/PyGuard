{
  "purpose": "This code appears to perform data processing and possibly communicates with external servers, but the exact purpose is unclear due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, potentially user inputs via function parameters, or external data files (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (HTTP requests), file writes, or subprocess calls, which could be used for data exfiltration or executing commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and may reach network or system execution points, indicating possible data leakage or command execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious code snippets. No suspicious obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing with imports, variable assignments, and function calls. There are no signs of code injection, malicious payloads, or hidden backdoors. It utilizes common libraries and appears to follow typical programming patterns. Without specific network or system command code shown, malicious intent is not evident. The lack of context limits confidence, but nothing suspicious stands out.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign but should be reviewed in its full context for any hidden or runtime behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
