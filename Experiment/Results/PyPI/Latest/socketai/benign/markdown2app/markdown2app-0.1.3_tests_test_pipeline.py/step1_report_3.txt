  "purpose": "The file appears to be a test script for a pipeline system, likely used for testing or development purposes.",
  "sources": "There are no apparent sources of input or data reading operations in the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink operations that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present due to lack of code execution or data handling logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a filename comment and a docstring with no functional code, inputs, outputs, or executable logic. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a filename comment and an empty docstring, indicating it is likely a placeholder or documentation. There are no functional elements, data handling, or suspicious activities. The absence of code makes malicious behavior or security risks impossible to assess beyond noting the lack of any executable logic.",
  "conclusion": "This file appears to be a non-executable placeholder or comment block with no potential for malicious activity. It does not include any code that could be used maliciously or pose a security risk.",
