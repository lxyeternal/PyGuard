  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a minimal, static version string assignment with a simple getter function. There are no dynamic behaviors, no external inputs, no code obfuscation, and no suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and typical for package version info.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**  \nBased on the code provided, there are no issues such as malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscation. The reports correctly identify the code as benign and purely informational.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**  \nNo report makes unwarranted assumptions; all conclude the code is safe. The analysis is consistent and justified.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**  \nGiven the simplicity of the code, there is no reason to adjust scores upward. The code does not pose any security threat or contain hidden malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no security issues. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Note:** The scores align with the code's actual behavior. Any deviation from 0 would be unjustified unless new evidence emerges.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nI agree with the current scores. The code is safe, and the assessment is accurate.",
