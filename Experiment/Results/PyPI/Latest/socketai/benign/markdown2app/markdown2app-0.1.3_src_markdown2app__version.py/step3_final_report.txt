  "purpose": "Provide package version information.",
  "sources": "The static variable __version__ and the get_version() function returning it.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted inputs are used or processed.",
  "flows": "The function get_version() returns the static __version__ value directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a fixed version string and a simple getter function. It does not involve dynamic code execution, external inputs, or network communication. The code is minimal and typical for version reporting in Python packages. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified. The confidence score of 1 reflects high certainty of benignity. The code's purpose is purely informational, posing minimal security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The existing scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
