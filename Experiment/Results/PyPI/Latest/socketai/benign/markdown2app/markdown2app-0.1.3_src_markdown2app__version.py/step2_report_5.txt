  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - The code is a minimal, static version information module.\n   - It defines a fixed version string `__version__ = \"0.1.3\"` and a simple function `get_version()` that returns this string.\n   - There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no environment variables, and no external communications.\n   - The code is straightforward, typical for package version reporting.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and purely informational.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features, these scores are appropriate.\n   - The confidence score is 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not claim or imply any vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n   - No report suggests any reason to suspect malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is standard, benign, and poses no security risk.\n   - The scores assigned across all reports are consistent and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate; no changes are necessary. The code is safe and standard for version reporting.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is straightforward, benign, and has no security concerns.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action or adjustment needed.",
