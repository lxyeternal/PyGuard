  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, considering the provided code snippet:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\n# Testy modułu audio\n\"\"\"\ntest_audio.py\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n**Assessment of the code:**\n- The code contains only a comment and a docstring.\n- No imports, functions, classes, executable statements, data handling, or logic.\n- No input/output, network activity, or external communication.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5 Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal placeholder with no executable content.\n- They consistently note the absence of data sources, sinks, or flows.\n- They conclude there is no malicious activity, security risk, or obfuscation.\n\n**Are the issues present?**\n- **Yes.** The code does not contain any executable or data-processing elements. It’s just a filename comment and a docstring.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the lack of code, logic, or data handling.\n- No false positives or overestimations are evident.\n- The conclusion that there is no security concern is justified.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These are appropriate given the code content.\n\n**Potential concerns or assumptions:**\n- The reports assume the code is just a placeholder, which is consistent with the content.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious code are made, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final scoring considerations:\n\n**Malware score:**\n- Since there's no executable code, no external communication, and nothing suspicious, **malware should remain at 0**.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n- The code is straightforward and minimal; no obfuscation is present. **Obfuscated should remain at 0**.\n\n**Risk score:**\n- Given the lack of any logic, data flow, or potential attack vectors, **risk should be 0**.\n\n**Confidence:**\n- High confidence (close to 1), as the analysis confirms the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                                  |\n|--------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0      | No malicious code, no suspicious activity.                       |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      | Clear, minimal placeholder code with no obfuscation.            |\n| Security Risk      | 0      | No data flow, no external communication, no executable logic.   |\n| Confidence         | 1      | The analysis is straightforward and conclusive.                 |\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n- The existing scores are accurate and reasonable.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign placeholder with no security concerns.**",
