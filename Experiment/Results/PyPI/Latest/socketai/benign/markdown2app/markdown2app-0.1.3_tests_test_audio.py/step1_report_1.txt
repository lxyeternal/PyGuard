  "anomalies": "Code is a simple comment and filename string with no executable content; no suspicious or unusual code features observed",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a filename comment and a docstring indicating it's a test module for audio. There are no imports, functions, or executable statements. Since no data processing, input, or output is present, there are no security concerns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The code is minimal and appears to be a placeholder or a filename reference.",
