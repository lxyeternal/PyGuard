  "sources": "No data sources; the code contains only comments and a string literal.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; there are no data flows, input/output, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present due to lack of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is trivial with only comments and a docstring, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-executable placeholder with no functions, data processing, or logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.
