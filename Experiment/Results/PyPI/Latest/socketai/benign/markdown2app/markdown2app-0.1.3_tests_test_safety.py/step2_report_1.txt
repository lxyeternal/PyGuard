  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code snippet, which consists solely of a filename comment and an empty docstring:\n\n```python\n# Testy modułu bezpieczeństwa\n\"\"\"\ntest_safety.py\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code contains no executable statements, functions, data handling, or input/output operations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- All reports correctly identify that this is a minimal, placeholder, or test module with no security concerns.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign and non-functional.\n- No false positives or unwarranted concerns are evident.\n\n**3. Score Justifications:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which aligns with the minimal content.\n\n**4. Risk and Malware Scores:**\n- Since there's no executable code, no data flow, and no suspicious patterns, the scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n- The code is benign; no need to increase scores.\n\n**5. Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n- The reports assume this is a test module, which is consistent with the filename and comments.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious code are necessary; the minimal content provides no basis for such.\n\n**6. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Estimated Security Risk Score:** **0**\n\nThe code is a simple placeholder with no executable logic or security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this minimal code snippet. The scores assigned are appropriate, and there are no discrepancies or concerns that warrant adjustment.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The current assessments are accurate and justified.",
