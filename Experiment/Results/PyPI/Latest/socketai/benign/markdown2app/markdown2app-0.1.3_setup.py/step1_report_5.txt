  "purpose": "Setup script for installing the markdown2app Python package, including metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description, reading _version.py for version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or insecure data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (README.md, _version.py) into variables used in setup() configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: reading a README file for description, executing a version file to extract version info, and calling setuptools.setup() with metadata. No dynamic code execution beyond simple exec() of a version file, which is typical for version management. No external inputs, untrusted data, or network communications involved. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a straightforward, legitimate package configuration with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
