  "flows": "Read README.md -> execute _version.py -> set version in setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on '_version.py' to obtain version info; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project. It reads the long description from README.md and executes '_version.py' to get the version number. The use of exec() is common but can be risky if '_version.py' is malicious or tampered with. No network activity, user input, obfuscation, or suspicious code is present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical packaging patterns. The main concern is the potential risk associated with executing external code, but assuming the version file is secure, the risk remains minimal. No malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The scores reflect this: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1-0.3 depending on trust in '_version.py'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script with a minor potential risk due to the use of exec() for version retrieval. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. Ensuring the integrity of '_version.py' mitigates the primary concern.",
