  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to identify any discrepancies, errors, or overlooked risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 & 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Both reports conclude that the script is standard, safe, and free of malicious behavior. They correctly identify that the code reads external files (README.md and _version.py) for configuration and versioning, with no untrusted input or network activity.\n\n- **Validation:** The code indeed performs typical setup tasks. The use of `exec()` on `_version.py` is common in package versioning, assuming the version file is trustworthy. No anomalies or suspicious code are present.\n\n- **Conclusion:** These reports are accurate; the code is safe, with no malware or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Highlights the use of `exec()` on `_version.py` as a potential risk, noting that if `_version.py` is compromised, malicious code could execute.\n\n- **Analysis:** This is a valid concern. Using `exec()` on external files can be risky if the file is malicious or tampered with. However, in typical package development, `_version.py` is a controlled, trusted file, so the risk is minimal if the environment is secure.\n\n- **Scores:** The report assigns a confidence of 0.8, malware score 0, and security risk 0.3, reflecting some concern but not a high threat level.\n\n- **Justification:** The risk score of 0.3 seems reasonable given the potential for malicious modification of `_version.py`. However, if `_version.py` is verified to be unaltered, the actual risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 & 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Both affirm that the script is standard, safe, and free of malicious activity, with no suspicious code or external network interactions.\n\n- **Validation:** Their conclusions align with the code's logic.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports agree that the code is standard and safe, with the only potential concern being the use of `exec()` on `_version.py`. This is a common pattern, and in a controlled environment, it poses minimal risk.\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** \n  - Reports 1, 2, 4, 5 assign 0, which is reasonable.\n  - Report 3 assigns 0.3, which is cautious but justified considering the `exec()` use.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to `exec()` usage, which is a known pattern but should be verified)\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n\n- The `exec()` on `_version.py` is the only point of concern, but in a typical, controlled package environment, this is acceptable. If `_version.py` is verified to be unaltered and from a trusted source, the risk is minimal.\n\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1            |\n\nThe overall risk is very low, with the main caveat being the `exec()` pattern, which should be maintained only if `_version.py` remains secure and unaltered.",
