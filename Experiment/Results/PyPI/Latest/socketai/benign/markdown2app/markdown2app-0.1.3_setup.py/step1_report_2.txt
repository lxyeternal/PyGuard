{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for installing the 'markdown2app' Python package, including metadata, versioning, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, reads the version from src/markdown2app/_version.py, and static metadata fields such as author and URL.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are evident; the setup configuration outputs metadata and package data only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external files (README.md and _version.py) into variables used by setup(), without any untrusted user input or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated behavior are present. The code follows standard setup.py patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to read external files (README.md and _version.py) for configuration, then invokes setup() with static and dynamically loaded parameters. No code injection, malicious network activity, or obfuscated logic detected. All data sources are controlled files, and there are no unusual or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It responsibly loads version info and documentation, with no hidden or malicious intent.",
