{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the installation configuration for the 'markdown2app' Python package, including reading metadata and package info.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description, reads _version.py to get version information, and executes its content.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external code via exec() on _version.py, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution if the file is malicious.",
  "flows": "exec() reads and runs code from 'src/markdown2app/_version.py' and assigns it to the version dictionary, which is then used in setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on a version file can be risky if the file is tampered with; no other suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures with external file reads for description and version. The only notable concern is the use of exec() to evaluate '_version.py', which, if compromised, could execute malicious code. All other code appears normal and intended for package installation configuration.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, this is typical setup code with a potential risk associated with executing external code via exec(). If '_version.py' is secure and unaltered, the risk is minimal. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
