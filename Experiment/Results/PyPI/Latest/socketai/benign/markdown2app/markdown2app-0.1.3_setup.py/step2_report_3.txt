  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Standard setup script; reads README.md for long description, executes _version.py for version info. No suspicious code, no untrusted input, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the script as safe and typical.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; standard setup script with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Valid; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Noted that the use of `exec()` on `_version.py` could be risky if the file is compromised, but otherwise standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3\n- **Analysis:** The risk score of 0.3 reflects a potential security concern due to `exec()`. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate unless malicious code is present.\n- **Recommendation:** The risk score is reasonable; no malware detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Completely standard setup script, no suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Standard, safe setup script, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the script as standard and safe.\n- The only point of concern is the use of `exec()` in Report 3, which is acknowledged as a potential security risk if `_version.py` is compromised.\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected in any report)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** Given the use of `exec()`, a moderate risk score of around **0.3** is justified, assuming the version file is trustworthy. If `_version.py` is under control and verified, the risk diminishes, but the use of `exec()` remains a potential vector if compromised.\n\n### Critical note:\n- The `exec()` call is the only point of concern. If `_version.py` is secured and maintained properly, the risk remains low.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 (due to `exec()` usage)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
