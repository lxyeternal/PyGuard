{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'markdown2app', including reading metadata and version info.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; reads _version.py to obtain version number; user input or external files are not directly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious execution are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or external systems; setup process is standard and static.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup.py procedures with safe file handling and version extraction.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading README for description, executing a version file to get version info, and calling setup() with package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions from untrusted sources, no obfuscated or malicious code, and no external network interactions. All data reads are from local files, and the data handling appears conventional and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py script for Python packaging, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
