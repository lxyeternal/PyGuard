  "purpose": "Setup script for installing the markdown2app Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description, reading _version.py for version info, input parameters for setup() function.",
  "targets": "Potentially vulnerable areas include reading external files and executing code from _version.py.",
  "flows": "File reading for version info and description; no untrusted data flows to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; standard setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading a README for long description, executing a version file, and calling setup() with package metadata. No untrusted input is processed in a way that could lead to code injection or malicious behavior. The exec() call on _version.py is typical for version management and appears benign assuming the version file is trustworthy. There are no external network connections, no dynamic code execution beyond the standard pattern, and no suspicious code anomalies. The script lacks any obfuscated or hidden code. Overall, the code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard and safe. It reads necessary files for package configuration and executes a version file, which is a common pattern. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
