  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is purely metadata and documentation, with no executable logic, data processing, or external communication.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - The code is benign, serving as a package header with version, author, and email information.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is non-executable and purely descriptive.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign scores of `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code content.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary based on the provided information.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree that there's no executable code, no data flows, and no suspicious activity, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified.\n   - The code is purely metadata with no security implications.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No questionable assumptions are present; all assessments are consistent with the code snippet.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Final Expert Estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the provided assessments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence that the code is merely package metadata and documentation, with no malicious or risky elements.",
