  "flows": "No data flows; code contains only static metadata and comments",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is purely descriptive, serving as package metadata with no executable logic, data processing, or external communication. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's benign nature is consistent across all assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, metadata-only package header with no malicious intent or security concerns. The provided reports are accurate, and the scoring is justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
