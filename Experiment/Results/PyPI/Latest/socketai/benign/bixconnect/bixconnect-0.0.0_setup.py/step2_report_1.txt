  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, static setup script for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code, user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved.\n- Commented-out lines contain metadata or dependencies but no executable or suspicious code.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code as provided is syntactically correct and functional for its purpose.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; the code does not perform any runtime actions, network calls, or data processing.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; no secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct. No malware activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct. No obfuscation.\n- **Risk score (0):** Correct. No security risks identified.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The code is purely static configuration.\n- Commented lines are benign and do not contain secrets or malicious code.\n- No external data or user input is involved.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. The code is a standard, benign setup script with no security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores as they are: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If future versions of this code include dynamic behavior, external data handling, or hidden code, re-evaluation would be necessary.",
