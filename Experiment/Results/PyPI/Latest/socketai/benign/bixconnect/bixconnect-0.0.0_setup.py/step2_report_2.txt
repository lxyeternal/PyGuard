  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, static setup script for a Python package.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, or environment variables are involved.\n- Commented-out lines contain metadata but no executable or suspicious code.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None of the reports find any malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports confirm the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign a risk score of 0 or 1 with high confidence, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Malware score:** All indicate zero, consistent with no malicious activity.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent; no anomalies or suspicious claims are present.\n- The only minor point is that the code is minimal, but that’s typical for a setup script.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Since the code is entirely benign, the scores seem appropriate.\n- The risk score could be kept at 0, as there's no security concern.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll evidence points to this being a standard, benign Python package setup script with no security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain as is.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- No changes needed in scoring.\n- I agree with the overall assessment: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.",
