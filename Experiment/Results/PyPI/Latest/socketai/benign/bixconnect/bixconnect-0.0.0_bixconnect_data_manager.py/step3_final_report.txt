{
  "purpose": "This code provides API client classes for managing data connectors and datasets, constructing endpoint URLs dynamically based on input parameters, and invoking request methods.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'url', 'token', 'inputId', 'data', 'params', 'connectorId', 'datasetId', 'limit', etc., used in URL concatenation and request payloads.",
  "sinks": "Potential URL injection points where untrusted input (e.g., 'inputId', 'connectorId', 'datasetId') are directly embedded into URL strings without validation or sanitization.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from function arguments into URL strings; these URLs are then used in HTTP request methods (_get_request, _post_request).",
  "anomalies": "Typo in method name 'vaild' instead of 'valid'; use of direct string concatenation for URLs without validation; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client wrapper with classes for data connectors and datasets, dynamically constructing URLs based on input parameters. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is potential injection if inputs are untrusted, due to direct URL concatenation. The malware score is 0, as no malicious actions are evident. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code clarity. The security risk score is 0.2, reflecting typical risks associated with unvalidated URL parameters in API clients. The code's structure and logic are standard, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws beyond the need for input validation in deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client implementation with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The main security consideration is ensuring input validation to prevent injection vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
