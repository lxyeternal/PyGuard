{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python class for making authenticated HTTP GET and POST requests to specified endpoints, with error handling and JSON response processing.",
  "sources": "The class reads input data from method parameters (endpoint URLs, request data, token) and request responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing error messages, response handling, and JSON decoding, which could leak sensitive information if responses contain secrets.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to request functions, where tokens and endpoint URLs are used to perform network requests; responses are processed and potentially outputted via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not appear to include obfuscated elements, malicious backdoors, or hardcoded secrets; it handles errors explicitly. No suspicious dynamic code execution or suspicious network behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly manages network requests with appropriate headers and error handling. It uses the token for authentication, which is passed at runtime, avoiding hardcoded credentials. Error messages are printed directly, which could leak info if responses contain secrets, but this alone is not malicious. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware-like behaviors, are detected. The logic is straightforward and intended for legitimate API communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for making authenticated requests with error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within the provided code fragment.",
