{
  "purpose": "A simple Python class to perform authenticated GET and POST requests to a specified endpoint with error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads the URL and token from class initialization, input parameters for endpoints and data in methods.",
  "sinks": "The token and data passed to methods could potentially be misused if exposed elsewhere; the responses are returned after parsing JSON.",
  "flows": "Token and URL are used as headers; requests are made with potential JSON responses; errors are caught and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed. No code obfuscation or hidden behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward HTTP request methods with proper error handling. The token is passed as an argument to the class and used in headers. The methods handle exceptions including HTTP errors, connection issues, timeouts, and JSON decode errors. No data leaks, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity are evident. The structure and logic are standard for HTTP request handling. The code does not perform any malicious actions or include malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility class for making authenticated requests with robust error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
