  "purpose": "A Python class providing authenticated HTTP GET and POST requests with error handling and JSON parsing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: URL, token, endpoint, data, and response content.",
  "sinks": "Response JSON parsing, printing error messages that include response text.",
  "flows": "Input token used in headers; request sent via requests.get/post; response processed or errors printed.",
  "anomalies": "Error messages include response text, which could leak sensitive info; no obfuscation or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client with standard error handling. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. Error messages could leak info but are typical for debugging. No malicious behavior detected. The code structure is clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing a standard API request pattern with minimal security concerns. The primary issue is potential info leakage via error messages, which is common and not malicious.",
