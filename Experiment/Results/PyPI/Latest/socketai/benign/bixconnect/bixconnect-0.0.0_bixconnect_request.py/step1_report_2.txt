{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for making authenticated HTTP GET and POST requests to specified endpoints, handling responses and errors.",
  "sources": "The 'token' provided during class instantiation is used as an authorization credential; 'endpoint' and 'params' or 'data' are inputs to request methods.",
  "sinks": "Response handling involves printing error messages; no data is stored or transmitted elsewhere. No external or untrusted data flows outside the class in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('endpoint', 'params', 'data') flow into request methods, which generate HTTP requests with headers including the token. Responses are processed locally with error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated logic. Error handling is standard. No malicious behavior detected in request handling.",
  "analysis": "The code properly manages request headers, including the authorization token. It handles various request exceptions and JSON decoding errors appropriately. No use of dynamic execution, no data exfiltration mechanisms, and no backdoors are present. The token is a parameter, avoiding hardcoded secrets. The code appears to be a standard HTTP client wrapper with error handling. No indicators of malicious intent or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a secure and typical HTTP request handler with proper error management. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or data leaks. The design is straightforward and standard.",
