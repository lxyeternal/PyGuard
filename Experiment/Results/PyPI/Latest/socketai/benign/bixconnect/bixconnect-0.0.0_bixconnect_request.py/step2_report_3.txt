  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code: a Python class for making authenticated HTTP GET and POST requests, with error handling.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1 to 0.2), which seems reasonable given the code's function.\n- The confidence levels are high (~0.9-0.95), indicating the reviewers agree on the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious behavior?** No. The code is a typical API client.\n- **Hardcoded secrets?** No, token is passed during instantiation.\n- **Obfuscation?** No, code is clear.\n- **Malware?** No, no malicious payloads or behaviors.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- Error messages include response text, which could leak sensitive info if responses contain secrets. This is a minor security concern but not malicious.\n- No other significant flaws.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, justified.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's benign nature, these are reasonable.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports mention potential info leaks via error messages, but this is standard debugging behavior, not malicious.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly identifies the code as standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a typical, well-structured API client.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to error message info leakage, which is common in debugging but could be improved)\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's scores are reasonable and justified based on the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard API request handler with proper error handling, no malicious activity, and no obfuscation. The scores reflect this accurately.",
