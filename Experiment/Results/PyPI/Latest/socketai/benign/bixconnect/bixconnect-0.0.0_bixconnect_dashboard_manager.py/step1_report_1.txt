{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for managing dashboards via API requests, including creating, cloning, deleting, and managing permissions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as url, token, inputId, params, and data used in methods.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request methods (_get_request, _post_request) that send data over the network; potentially sensitive data included in these requests.",
  "flows": "User inputs (inputId, data) flow into endpoint URL constructions and are used in HTTP request methods; data can be sent unfiltered to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or obfuscated code. Usage of string concatenation for endpoints is standard but could potentially lead to injection if not sanitized externally, but no direct malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client for dashboard management. It constructs endpoint URLs dynamically based on input parameters and calls inherited HTTP methods. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The code relies on external methods (_get_request, _post_request) which are not shown; assuming they are standard HTTP wrappers. No suspicious or obfuscated patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API wrapper for dashboard operations with no malicious intent. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The primary security consideration is ensuring that input parameters are sanitized externally, but within this code, nothing indicates malicious activity.",
