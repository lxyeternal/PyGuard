  "purpose": "API client wrapper for dashboard management, constructing URLs dynamically based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'inputId', 'params', and 'data' used in URL construction and request payloads.",
  "sinks": "The URL endpoints where 'inputId' is embedded, and request methods (_get_request, _post_request) which send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to build endpoint URLs; data is sent via _post_request; responses are returned from these request methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string concatenation for URL construction with input parameters, which could pose injection risks if inputs are not sanitized externally.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client class for dashboard management, relying on inherited request methods. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The main security concern is potential injection via 'inputId' in URL paths, but this depends on external validation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the code's pattern and potential external validation issues. The code's structure is standard, and no logical flaws are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious API wrapper with a minor security consideration regarding input validation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
