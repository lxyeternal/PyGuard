{
  "purpose": "Defines a Dashboards class that manages dashboard-related API requests, including CRUD operations and permissions.",
  "sources": "User-supplied parameters such as inputId, data, and params passed into class methods.",
  "sinks": "Endpoint URLs constructed with input parameters, POST requests with data payloads.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (inputId, data, params) flow into endpoint URL construction and POST/GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements detected. Use of string concatenation for URL paths is standard but could be risky if input is not sanitized.",
  "analysis": "The class methods generate API request endpoints dynamically using input parameters. These inputs influence URL paths and request payloads, but there are no signs of malicious data handling, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code relies on parameters supplied at runtime, which are passed directly to request methods, but without evidence of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward API client wrapper for dashboard management, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows typical patterns for such clients, but caution should be exercised if input parameters are not sanitized elsewhere.",
