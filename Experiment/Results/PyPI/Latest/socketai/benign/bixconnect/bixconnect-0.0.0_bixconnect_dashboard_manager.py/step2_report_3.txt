  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward API client class for dashboard management.\n- It constructs URLs dynamically based on input parameters.\n- It uses inherited methods (_get_request, _post_request) to perform HTTP requests.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The main security concern is potential injection if input parameters (like inputId) are not sanitized externally, but this is outside the scope of this code fragment.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, standard API wrapper, high confidence (0.9), malware=0.\n- **Scores:** securityRisk=0.2, malware=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, well-structured, no malicious intent, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** securityRisk=0.2, malware=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, mentions potential injection risk due to URL concatenation but no actual malicious code.\n- **Scores:** securityRisk=0.2, malware=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct, but note that the risk score is set at 0.2, reflecting a minor concern about input validation, which is reasonable.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no malicious behavior, standard API client, with caution about input validation.\n- **Scores:** securityRisk=0.2, malware=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same overall conclusion, no malicious activity, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** securityRisk=0.2, malware=0.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Set at 0.2 across reports, acknowledging potential injection risks if inputs are not sanitized externally. This is reasonable given the code's pattern.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- Since the code does not contain any malware or obfuscation, I agree with the current scores.\n- The primary security concern is external input validation, which is outside this code's scope.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to URL concatenation without validation, but not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.
