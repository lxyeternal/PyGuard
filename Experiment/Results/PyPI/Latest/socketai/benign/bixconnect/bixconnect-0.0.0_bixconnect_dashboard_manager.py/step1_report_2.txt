  "purpose": "Define a class for managing dashboards via API requests, including CRUD operations and permission management.",
  "sources": "Reads include constructor parameters (url, token), method parameters (inputId, data, params). No external or untrusted data sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "Uses internal methods (_get_request, _post_request) with constructed endpoints and data; potential sinks are the API request functions that send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method input parameters through endpoint URL constructions to internal request functions, potentially transmitting data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No obfuscated code, no unusual code constructs. Endpoint URL concatenation appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The class encapsulates API interaction methods for dashboards, constructing endpoints dynamically based on input IDs. It uses standard HTTP methods for create, read, update, delete, and permission management. The code appears to be well-structured, with no evident malicious logic such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network calls outside the intended API requests. There are no signs of backdoors or hidden malicious behaviors. The code relies on inherited request methods, which are not shown, but based on this code, there's no indication of malicious intent. Overall, the code seems to be a legitimate API client wrapper with no malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward API client class for dashboard management. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent. It performs standard API endpoint construction and request handling without any suspicious logic.",
