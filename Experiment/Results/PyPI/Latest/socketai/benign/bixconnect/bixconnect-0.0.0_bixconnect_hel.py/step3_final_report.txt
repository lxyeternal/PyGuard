{
  "purpose": "The code imports common data analysis libraries and a local module, then defines a simple print function, serving as a minimal setup for data visualization or processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib, seaborn, json, and data_manager module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; no network or file output observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines a function with no data processing or transfer",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code is simple, with standard library imports and a trivial print function. No data input/output, network activity, or complex logic. The import of 'data_manager' does not imply malicious intent, especially since it is not invoked. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report appears to be an overestimate; the code itself poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. and a very low security risk. The slight security risk score of 0.1 can be adjusted to 0 for consistency, but it is acceptable as is.",
