  "purpose": "Define classes for managing groups and users through HTTP requests to a specified API.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from method parameters (e.g., inputId, data, params), and URLs constructed with input parameters.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request methods (_get_request, _post_request) which send data to endpoints; potential for data leakage or misuse if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (inputId, data, params) are used to construct URLs and request payloads, then sent via HTTP request methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code. The URL concatenation uses simple string addition without validation or sanitization, which could be unsafe if inputs are untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, Grouops and Users, both inheriting from Request. They construct API endpoints dynamically based on input parameters. The code relies on external methods (_get_request and _post_request) for HTTP communication. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The URL construction using concatenation with inputId could be unsafe if inputId is not validated externally, but in this context, it appears as standard practice. There are no signs of malicious code, secret leaks, or backdoors. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no immediate security concerns aside from potential injection if input parameters are not validated elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as an API client wrapper for user and group management. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The only minor concern is the reliance on external validation for input parameters to prevent injection or URL manipulation, but within this snippet, it appears safe.",
