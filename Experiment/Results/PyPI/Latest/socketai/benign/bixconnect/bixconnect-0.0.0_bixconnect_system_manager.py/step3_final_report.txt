  "purpose": "This code defines API client classes for managing 'groups' and 'users' via HTTP requests, constructing endpoints dynamically with user-provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'inputId', 'params', and 'data' used in URL concatenation for endpoint construction.",
  "sinks": "The constructed URLs where untrusted input could lead to injection or misuse if not validated.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into URL strings via concatenation, then into HTTP request methods (_get_request, _post_request).",
  "anomalies": "Use of string concatenation with input parameters without validation, potential for URL injection if inputs are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper with methods that build URLs dynamically. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The main concern is that inputs like 'inputId' and 'data' are directly embedded into URLs without sanitization, which could lead to injection if inputs are malicious and validation is not enforced externally. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malware. The malware score is correctly set to 0. The security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), reflecting potential injection risk if inputs are untrusted. Obfuscation is absent. The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The primary security concern is the potential for URL injection if inputs are not validated before use. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and align with this assessment.",
