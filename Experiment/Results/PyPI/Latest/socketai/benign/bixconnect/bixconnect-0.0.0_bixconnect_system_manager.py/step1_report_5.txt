{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for managing 'groups' and 'users' via HTTP requests, likely as part of an API client library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'url', 'token', 'inputId', 'params', and 'data' which are used to construct API endpoints and request data.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request methods (_get_request, _post_request) that send data to specified endpoints. Potentially dangerous if data contains malicious content, but typical for API clients.",
  "flows": "Input data (from parameters) flows into endpoint URL constructions and request payloads, then sent via HTTP methods. No evident data leaks or injection points beyond standard API request patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. Endpoints follow predictable REST patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs. No dynamic code execution or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for interacting with a REST API, building request URLs with provided parameters and invoking HTTP methods (_get_request and _post_request). These methods are not defined here but are assumed to be standard request wrappers. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are apparent. The code appears to be a typical API client implementation. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward API client for managing user and group resources. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. It appears to be a standard, benign implementation.",
