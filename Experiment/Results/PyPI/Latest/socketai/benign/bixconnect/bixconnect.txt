      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The commented-out lines are harmless and do not introduce any vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is negligible, and the likelihood of malicious behavior is effectively zero."

The main security consideration is ensuring input validation to prevent injection vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. and a very low security risk. The slight security risk score of 0.1 can be adjusted to 0 for consistency, but it is acceptable as is."
