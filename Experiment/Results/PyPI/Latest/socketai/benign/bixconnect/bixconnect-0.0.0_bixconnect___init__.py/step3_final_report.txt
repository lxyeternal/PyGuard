  "purpose": "Assign a version string to __version__ in a minimal Python package setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, data, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string '__version__' to '0.0.0'. It contains no input/output, external communication, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code aligns with standard practices for version declaration in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The current assessment scores are appropriate and accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
