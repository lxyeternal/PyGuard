  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and contains only a version string assignment, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. There are no additional functions, data handling, or external interactions. The simplicity suggests no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The presence of only a version assignment indicates this is a small part of a larger package, with no evidence of security risks or malicious activity in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets a version string. No anomalies or malware detected.",
