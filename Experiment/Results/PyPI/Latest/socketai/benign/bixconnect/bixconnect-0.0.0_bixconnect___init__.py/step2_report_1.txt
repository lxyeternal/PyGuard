  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Content**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is simply:\n   ```python\n   __version__ = '0.0.0'\n   ```\n   or similar minimal version assignment. There are no additional functions, data handling, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes**:  \n   No report indicates any logical errors or suspicious coding practices. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packages.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. This is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's simplicity and transparency.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified since the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**:  \n   The reports correctly dismiss any suspicion based on the minimal code. No assumptions are made about hidden behavior; the analysis is consistent with the code's transparency.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code content.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:  \n   - The version is set to `'0.0.0'`, which is a placeholder, but this is common in initial or stub packages and not inherently suspicious.\n   - No external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n\nGiven the evidence, the code is benign, standard, and contains no security issues or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Security Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. No changes are necessary.",
