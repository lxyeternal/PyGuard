  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No input/output, data flows, external communications, or complex logic are present.\n   - The code snippet is minimal, typical for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the simplicity of the code.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The assessments correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which seems reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code only assigns a version string and contains no suspicious activity, there's no justification for a higher risk score.\n   - The risk scores of 0 across all reports are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, which is accurate.\n   - No malicious activity is indicated or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - They recognize the code as a standard practice in packaging.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code snippet is a straightforward version declaration.\n- All reports correctly identify it as benign with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: a simple, harmless version string assignment with no malicious or obfuscating behavior.",
