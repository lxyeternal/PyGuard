  "sources": "global_settings.ZHIPU_API_KEYS, global_settings.VOLCENGINE_API_KEYS",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations",
  "flows": "Loading API keys from global settings -> Creating APIKeyPool instances -> Instantiating interface objects with key pools",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward API client initialization without suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, retrieves API key lists from a configuration object, initializes singleton API key pools for each provider, and creates interface instances with these pools. The code is clear, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs. The reports of 'Empty response' are external API issues, not caused by this code. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are evident. The code does not handle responses or errors, but that does not imply malicious intent. The scores should reflect low risk and no malware suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client setup with no malicious or security issues. The 'Empty response' reports are likely operational or network-related problems, not security breaches or supply chain attacks. The code itself is safe, and the risk and malware scores should be minimal.",
