  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for language model chat interactions, including methods for standard chat and streaming chat.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'SimpleLLMFunc.interface.key_pool' and 'SimpleLLMFunc.logger'; usage of 'get_current_trace_id()' as default argument for 'trace_id'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication; methods only define signatures.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (messages, trace_id) flow into method signatures; no data flow beyond method definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'get_current_trace_id()' as default argument is typical; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward abstract class defining an interface with no implementation logic. It imports standard modules for key management and logging, using 'get_current_trace_id()' as a default parameter, which is common for tracing. No malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, risk: ~0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The code's purpose is purely structural, with no external network or data handling, indicating minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured interface definition for LLM interactions. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and risk scores are justified and consistent with the code's content.",
