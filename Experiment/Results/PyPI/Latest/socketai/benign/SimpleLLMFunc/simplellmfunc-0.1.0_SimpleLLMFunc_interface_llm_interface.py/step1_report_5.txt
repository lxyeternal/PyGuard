  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface class for interacting with a language model (LLM), including methods for chat and streaming chat.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules: 'SimpleLLMFunc.interface.key_pool' and 'SimpleLLMFunc.logger', as well as the get_current_trace_id() function. No input or data reading beyond these imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or direct data outputs are present in this code; the methods are abstract and do not implement data handling.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow is observable; the class defines method signatures with parameters that may include untrusted data when implemented, but no actual flows are present in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code consists solely of abstract class and method declarations with standard typing and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'LLM_Interface' with two abstract methods: 'chat' and 'chat_stream'. Both methods include parameters such as 'trace_id' (defaulting to get_current_trace_id()), 'messages' with a default message, and optional timeout. The imports include modules for key pooling and logging, but there are no dynamic data processing, insecure operations, or suspicious code patterns. No data handling or execution logic is implemented here; it is purely interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract class interface for LLM interactions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It provides method signatures for subclasses to implement, using standard practices. There are no anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or potential malware indicators.",
