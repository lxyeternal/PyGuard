  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for LLM interaction with methods for chatting and streaming chat.",
  "sources": "Import statements from SimpleLLMFunc.interface.key_pool and SimpleLLMFunc.logger, class initializations, get_current_trace_id() calls, and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of get_current_trace_id() and input parameters such as messages, stream, timeout, args, kwargs.",
  "flows": "Trace ID generated at each method call could be linked with messages and parameters, but no direct untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of get_current_trace_id() as default parameter could potentially generate or propagate trace identifiers, but this is typical logging practice, not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for LLM interfaces with two abstract methods for chat interactions. It imports external modules for key pooling and logging trace IDs. The get_current_trace_id() function is called at method defaults, which is standard for tracing. No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated constructs are present. The structure and logic appear typical for an interface definition in a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a standard interface definition for LLM communication, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily sets up method signatures and imports, with no direct data leaks, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
