  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for a language model (LLM) interaction class, including methods for chat and streaming chat.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external modules, class constructor, and abstract method signatures.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks; the code defines interface methods without implementation.",
  "flows": "No data flow to untrusted sources within this code; flow depends on implementations of abstract methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code. The use of get_current_trace_id() as default parameter could be inspected but appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an abstract base class with two abstract methods for chat functionalities, utilizing type hints and default parameters. The only external interactions are imports and the use of get_current_trace_id(), which seems to be a legitimate function for tracing purposes. No data is read from untrusted sources or written to external sinks within this code segment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a typical interface definition for a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract interface setup with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It simply defines method signatures for subclasses to implement. There are no signs of malware or security threats in this snippet.",
