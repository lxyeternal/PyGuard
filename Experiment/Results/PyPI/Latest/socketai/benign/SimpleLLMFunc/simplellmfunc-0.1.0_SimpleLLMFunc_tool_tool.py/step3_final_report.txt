  "purpose": "A utility framework for defining, describing, and serializing tools/functions for AI API integration, supporting type hints, docstring parsing, and Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Function parameters via inspect.signature and get_type_hints; docstring sections for parameter descriptions; Pydantic models for schema generation.",
  "sinks": "Serialization outputs for OpenAI API; no external untrusted data sources or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function signatures and docstrings into Parameter objects, then into schema serialization, and finally into OpenAI tool description dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for parsing docstrings, which can be fragile but not malicious; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard introspection, type hinting, and Pydantic schemas to generate API tool descriptions. No network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behaviors are present. The regex parsing, while potentially fragile, does not introduce security issues. The structure is clear, with no obfuscation or backdoors. The scoring aligns with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility for API tool description and serialization. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The conservative risk score (~0.1) accounts for regex parsing fragility but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities.",
