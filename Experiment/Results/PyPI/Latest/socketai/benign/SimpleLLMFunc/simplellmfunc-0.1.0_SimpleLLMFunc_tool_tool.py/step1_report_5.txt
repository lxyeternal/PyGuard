{
  "purpose": "The code defines a framework for creating and managing tools (functions) with automatic parameter extraction and serialization to OpenAI API format, supporting both decorator-based and subclassing approaches.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, docstrings (via regex parsing), and external modules (inspect, re, pydantic).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any obvious sinks that process untrusted data in a dangerous way; no data is being sent over the network, written to files, or executed dynamically.",
  "flows": "Parameter definitions and type hints flow from function signatures and docstrings into Parameter objects, which are then serialized into OpenAI function schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The use of regex for parsing docstrings is standard but can sometimes be fragile, yet not malicious. No use of eval, exec, or unsafe code execution. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a well-structured framework for defining tools with type annotations and documentation parsing. It relies on standard Python modules like inspect and re, and uses pydantic for model schemas. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or malicious behavior identified. The only potential concern is the use of regex for parsing docstrings, which could be fragile but not malicious. Overall, the code appears legitimate, intended for tool definition and serialization. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate framework for creating and serializing tools with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely handles type extraction, documentation parsing, and serialization without executing untrusted data or performing harmful operations.",
