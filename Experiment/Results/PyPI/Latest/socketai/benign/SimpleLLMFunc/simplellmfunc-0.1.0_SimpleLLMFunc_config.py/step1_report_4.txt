  "purpose": "Define application settings using environment variables, with support for secret decoding and caching of settings.",
  "sources": "Loading environment variables from a '.env' file and external input via environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink of untrusted data; environment variables are loaded and stored in memory.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are loaded into the Settings object, cached, and reused via get_settings().",
  "anomalies": "Use of ForceDecode in setting list of API keys is standard for secret handling; no suspicious hard-coded secrets or backdoors detected. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a settings class that loads environment variables from a '.env' file with specified encoding, ignoring unknown keys. It uses Pydantic's BaseSettings to manage configuration, with API key fields that support secret decoding. The get_settings function caches the Settings instance to optimize repeated access. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code adheres to best practices for configuration management, and no indicators of supply chain attack, malware, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration setup for managing environment variables securely. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
