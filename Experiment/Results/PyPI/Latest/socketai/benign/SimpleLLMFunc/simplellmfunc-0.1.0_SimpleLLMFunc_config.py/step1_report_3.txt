  "purpose": "Define and load application settings from environment variables and .env file, with support for API keys.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via pydantic's BaseSettings with env_file configuration, and dotenv load (though not explicitly called).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read during Settings instantiation, which is cached and reused.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ForceDecode for API keys could be a precaution for decoding, but no actual decoding code is present. The dotenv import is present but not used to load the env file explicitly, which is benign but slightly unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a settings class using pydantic's BaseSettings, specifying an environment file and encoding. Two lists of API keys are declared with ForceDecode annotation, implying decoding of environment variables into these lists. The get_settings function caches the Settings instance for efficiency. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The code appears to safely load configuration data from environment variables with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader with no malicious behavior. It safely reads environment variables into application settings, with support for multiple API keys. No malware or security risks are detected.",
