  "purpose": "Define application settings with environment variables and secure decoding, using Pydantic for configuration management.",
  "sources": "Environment file '.env' loaded via SettingsConfigDict, and environment variables for API keys (ZHIPU_API_KEYS and VOLCENGINE_API_KEYS).",
  "sinks": "Potentially the API keys stored in environment variables could be exposed if not handled securely, but no explicit sink of untrusted data beyond loading occurs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read into annotated list fields, then cached settings object is used throughout the application.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, backdoors, hardcoded secrets aside from API key placeholders, or suspicious dynamic execution. Use of dotenv and Pydantic is standard for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and third-party modules for configuration management, environment variable handling, and caching. It defines a Settings class with environment configuration, including lists of API keys with forced decoding. The get_settings function caches and returns a singleton Settings object, which is then assigned to global_settings. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code properly loads environment variables and manages secrets in a typical manner. No unusual data flows or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration setup for an application, securely loading API keys from environment variables via a .env file. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code appears safe and intentionally designed for configuration management.",
