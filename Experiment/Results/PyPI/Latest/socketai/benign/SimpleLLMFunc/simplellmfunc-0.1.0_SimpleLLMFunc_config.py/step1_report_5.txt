  "purpose": "Load and manage application configuration settings from environment variables and .env files using pydantic and caching.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables from a .env file and from the environment for API keys.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmission points are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are loaded into the Settings object, which is then cached for reuse.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; usage of ForceDecode on API keys is noted but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration management libraries and defines a Settings class that loads environment variables, specifically API keys. It uses pydantic for validation and environment variable parsing, with a cache for the Settings object. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are present. The use of ForceDecode on API keys is a standard method for decoding encoded environment variables, not malicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It securely loads API keys from environment variables and caches settings for efficiency. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
