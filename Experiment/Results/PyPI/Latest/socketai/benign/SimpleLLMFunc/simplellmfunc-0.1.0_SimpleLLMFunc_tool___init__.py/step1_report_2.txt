  "purpose": "This code exports references to 'Tool' and 'tool' from the local module 'tool'. It appears to be part of a module's __init__.py or similar file for packaging.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from its own module structure, specifically from '.tool'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this code that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious elements such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports and exposes 'Tool' and 'tool' from a submodule. It contains no data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely structural, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
