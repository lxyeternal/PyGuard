{
  "purpose": "This code exports specific classes or functions ('Tool' and 'tool') from a local module for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.tool' when importing 'Tool' and 'tool'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or can lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The code imports entities from the local module '.tool' and then exposes them via __all__ for external modules.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious or unusual code constructs, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module export pattern in Python. It imports 'Tool' and 'tool' from a local module named '.tool' and specifies these in __all__ for controlled exposure. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code structure is simple and typical for module initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as an interface to export certain components from a local module. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
