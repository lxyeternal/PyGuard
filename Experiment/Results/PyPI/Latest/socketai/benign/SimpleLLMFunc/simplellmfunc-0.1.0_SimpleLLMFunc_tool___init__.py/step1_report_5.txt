  "purpose": "Define exports for the current module by including the Tool class and tool object from a relative module.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.tool' (Tool, tool)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this code; it merely re-exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports two identifiers from a relative module named '.tool', then defines __all__ to explicitly export these identifiers. The code is straightforward and standard for Python module exports, with no indication of malicious behavior. It does not contain dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code snippet is minimal and lacks external input handling or output effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and follows standard Python practices.",
