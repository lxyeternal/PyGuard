{
  "purpose": "The code defines a module that exports two objects, 'Tool' and 'tool', imported from a local module named 'tool'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a local module 'tool' via import statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears minimal, with straightforward imports and exports; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports two objects from a local 'tool' module and exposes them via __all__. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execution of untrusted code. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. Its structure is typical for a Python module designed for re-exporting symbols.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to re-export imported symbols without any malicious intent or security risks.",
