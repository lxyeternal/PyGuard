  "anomalies": "None",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of 'Tool' and 'tool' from a local module '.tool' and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, data processing, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious patterns or security issues. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code. There are no anomalies or signs of malicious intent. The code's simplicity and lack of external data handling support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module re-export pattern with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and assessments in all reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
