  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code is just import statements with no executable logic, no data flow, no suspicious patterns. The analysis correctly states there's no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  None apparent. The reasoning is sound, and the confidence is high (0.9). The malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Score Justification:**  \n  Malware = 0 is appropriate. Security risk = 0 also makes sense. Obfuscated = 0 is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code only contains wildcard imports, which are generally discouraged but not malicious.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The report mentions wildcard imports as a coding concern but not malicious. This is accurate. The security risk is rated at 0.1, which is somewhat cautious but acceptable.\n\n- **Score Justification:**  \n  Malware = 0 is appropriate. Security risk = 0.1 reflects minor concern over wildcard imports but not a real threat.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Same pattern—only import statements, no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The analysis correctly states there's no malicious behavior, and the confidence is high (0.8). The security risk score is 0.1, which is reasonable.\n\n- **Score Justification:**  \n  Malware = 0, security risk = 0.1, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code is just import statements with high confidence (1.0). No suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The reasoning is sound. The confidence is maximum, and scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Score Justification:**  \n  Malware = 0, security risk = 0, consistent with benign code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Again, only import statements, standard practice.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The analysis notes that imported modules' content is unknown, which is correct. The security risk is rated at 0.2, slightly higher but still low, considering the lack of evidence.\n\n- **Score Justification:**  \n  Malware = 0, security risk = 0.2, which is cautious but acceptable given the unknowns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity based solely on import statements.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All zero, as expected.  \n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) mainly due to wildcard imports or unknown module content, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the evidence.  \n- Since all reports are based solely on import statements, and no malicious behavior is evident, I agree with the current scores.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for wildcard imports and unknown module contents, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the provided code snippets and reports, there is no evidence of malware or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and the analysis is sound. Further inspection of the imported modules could be warranted if more code is available, but from these snippets alone, the environment appears benign.",
