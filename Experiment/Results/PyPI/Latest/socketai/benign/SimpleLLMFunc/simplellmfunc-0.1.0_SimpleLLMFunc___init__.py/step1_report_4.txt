  "purpose": "Import modules from the SimpleLLMFunc package, likely for language model functions, logging, interface, and tools.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'SimpleLLMFunc' modules: llm_decorator, logger, interface, tool.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing shown; only module imports.",
  "anomalies": "Imports are straightforward; no suspicious or unusual patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a local package. No untrusted input sources, no data processing, no network calls, or code execution. The imports include modules related to LLM decorators, logging, interface, and tools, which are typical for a language model application setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent within these import statements alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, performing standard module imports for a language model-related project. There is no indication of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks based solely on these import statements.",
