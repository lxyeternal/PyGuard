{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to language model functions, logging, interfaces, and tools, likely for setting up or configuring a larger application involving LLMs.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'SimpleLLMFunc' package, specifically llm_decorator, logger, interface, and tool modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions are present in these import statements; they are just module imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling is visible in the provided snippet; these are only import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements with wildcard imports, which can be considered a bad practice but not inherently malicious. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The snippet shows only import statements from a package named 'SimpleLLMFunc'. The use of wildcard imports (*) can potentially introduce namespace pollution, but it does not indicate malicious behavior. There are no input sources, data processing, or sink functions present in this code. Without further context or actual logic, there's no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to only import modules from a local package related to language model functions. There is no indication of malicious activity, data leaks, or security issues based solely on these import statements. The use of wildcard imports is a coding concern but not malicious.",
