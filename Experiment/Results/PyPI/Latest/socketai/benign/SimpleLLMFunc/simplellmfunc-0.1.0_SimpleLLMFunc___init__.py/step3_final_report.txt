  "sources": "Import statements from 'SimpleLLMFunc' modules.",
  "sinks": "None, as there is no executable code or data flow.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only import statements present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) noted as a coding concern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, with no executable logic, data handling, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected. Wildcard imports are discouraged but do not constitute malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence is high due to the simplicity of the code snippet, and no anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor concern regarding wildcard imports is a coding style issue, not a security risk. The scores and analysis are appropriate and consistent with the evidence.",
