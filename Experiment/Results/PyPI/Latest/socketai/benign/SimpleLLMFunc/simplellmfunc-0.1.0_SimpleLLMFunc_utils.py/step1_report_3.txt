  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling generator objects, specifically retrieving the last item from a generator.",
  "sources": "Input generator passed as argument to 'get_last_item_of_generator' function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; function simply iterates over the generator.",
  "flows": "Generator data flows from input parameter to internal iteration, with no external data leaks or manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious constructs, or obfuscated code. The function performs a straightforward task.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic function to obtain the last element from a generator, iterating through all items and updating 'last_item'. There are no external data sources, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior. Usage of 'TypeVar' and type annotations is standard. No malicious or maliciously intended code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple utility function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a benign operation with no potential for abuse or data leakage.",
