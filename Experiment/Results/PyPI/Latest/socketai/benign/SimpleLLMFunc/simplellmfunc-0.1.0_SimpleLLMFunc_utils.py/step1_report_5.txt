  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for working with generators, specifically to retrieve the last item from a generator.",
  "sources": "Input generator passed to get_last_item_of_generator function.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data handling identified; function simply iterates over input.",
  "flows": "Generator input -> loop to retrieve last item -> return last item.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic function to extract the last element from a generator, iterating through all items to store the last one. It uses standard typing and control flow without external data access, side effects, or malicious constructs. No malware indicators or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility function with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and intended for general use.",
