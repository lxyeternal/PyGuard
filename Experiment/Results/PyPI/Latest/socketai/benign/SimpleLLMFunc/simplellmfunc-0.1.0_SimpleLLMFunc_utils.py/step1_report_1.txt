  "purpose": "Utility function to retrieve the last item from a generator object.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'generator' parameter, which is an iterable generator.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Generator input flows through iteration; the last item is stored and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Code performs a straightforward task with no unusual language features, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic type variable T and a function that iterates over a generator to find its last element. It uses standard Python constructs and type hints. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or suspicious network activity are present. The function is simple and intended for utility within the project, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It simply returns the last item in a generator, which is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs a simple, common operation securely.",
