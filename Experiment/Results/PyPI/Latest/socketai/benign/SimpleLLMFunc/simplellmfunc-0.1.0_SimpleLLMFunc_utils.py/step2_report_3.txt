  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n\nThe code defines a simple utility function:\n\n```python\ndef get_last_item_of_generator(generator: Generator[T, None, None]) -> T | None:\n    last_item = None\n    for item in generator:\n        last_item = item\n    return last_item\n```\n\n- It iterates over a generator and returns the last item, or None if the generator is empty.\n- Uses standard Python constructs, type hints, and no obfuscation.\n- No external system calls, no network activity, no data leaks.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.\n\n**Security and Malware Assessment:**\n\n- The function performs a benign, straightforward task.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware.\n- No external dependencies or side effects.\n- The code does not manipulate or leak data in any suspicious way.\n\n**Scores and Reasoning:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — The code is purely a utility function with no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The detailed reasoning in each report aligns with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct as per reports)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct as per reports)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (appropriate, given the benign nature)\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' evaluations.** The code is a standard utility function with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is safe, simple, and performs a common task.\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n- The detailed analysis supports the conclusion that this code poses no security or malware risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores and conclusions.",
