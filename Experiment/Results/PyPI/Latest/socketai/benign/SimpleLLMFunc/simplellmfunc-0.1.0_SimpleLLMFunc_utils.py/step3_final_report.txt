  "purpose": "Utility function to retrieve the last item from a generator.",
  "sources": "The generator passed as an argument to the function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external systems are involved; the function does not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "Generator yields data, which is iterated over to update 'last_item', then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward iteration with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured utility that iterates over a generator to find its last element. It uses standard Python constructs, type hints, and no dynamic code execution, network activity, or embedded secrets. All provided reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the scoring appropriately reflects the low risk profile.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
