{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer and module importer for the 'aymara_ai' Python SDK, aggregating imports and setting up logging.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules such as .types, ._client, ._models, ._constants, ._exceptions, etc., and the setup_logging function.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code only imports modules, sets attributes, and calls setup_logging.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The only function call is _setup_logging(), which is a standard logging setup with no data input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are detected. The code is straightforward and typical for module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components from internal modules, assigns module attributes for error handling and version info, and invokes a logging setup function. It does not process user input, handle environment variables, or perform network operations. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. All imported modules and functions are standard for SDK initialization. The for loop modifies __module__ attributes to improve error message clarity, which is a benign and common practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer that imports and re-exports components and configures logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intended for normal SDK setup.",
