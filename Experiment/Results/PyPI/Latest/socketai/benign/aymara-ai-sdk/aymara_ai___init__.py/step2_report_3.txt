  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, focusing on the code's content, potential security issues, and the scoring justification.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a package initializer for the 'aymara_ai' SDK.\n- Imports various internal modules, constants, error classes, models, and utilities.\n- Sets the `__module__` attribute for exported symbols to improve error message clarity.\n- Calls `_setup_logging()` to configure logging.\n- No user input, network operations, or data processing is performed.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code performs standard package setup tasks; no issues are present.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation techniques are used.\n- **Security risks:** The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or handle secrets.\n- **Data flow:** No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n\n### Analysis of the reports:\nAll five reports agree that the code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. They correctly identify that the code:\n- Only imports modules.\n- Sets module attributes.\n- Calls a logging setup function.\n- Does not process external or untrusted data.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The code is purely for module setup, with no data handling, network activity, or code execution based on external input.\n- The modification of `__module__` attributes is a benign practice to improve error reporting.\n- The code is auto-generated but contains no malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The reports' scores and reasoning are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
