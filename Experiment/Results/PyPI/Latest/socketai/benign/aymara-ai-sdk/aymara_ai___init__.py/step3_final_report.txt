{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer for the 'aymara_ai' Python SDK, importing modules, setting up logging, and adjusting __module__ attributes for better error messaging.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules and functions, such as types, utils, client classes, models, constants, and error classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network activity, data processing, or external inputs are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from module imports to setting __module__ attributes and calling the logging setup function, with no external data or untrusted inputs involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, auto-generated package setup code with benign modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package setup script that imports internal modules, modifies __module__ attributes for better error messages, and configures logging. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or include any obfuscated or suspicious code. The consistent absence of malicious patterns, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities indicates a benign purpose. The modification of __module__ attributes is a common practice to improve error reporting and does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate. No further action or modification is necessary.",
