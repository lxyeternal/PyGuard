      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions and protocols for an HTTP client library. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and should remain as is, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low risk score (~0.1). Overall, the code poses no security threat and is suitable for use in a safe environment."
