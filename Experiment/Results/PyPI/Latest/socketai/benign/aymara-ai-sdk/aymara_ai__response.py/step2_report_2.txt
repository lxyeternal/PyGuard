  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code handles HTTP responses, parsing, streaming, and resource management for an API client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks like command execution. Data flows are primarily response parsing and file writing.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No anomalies, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Uses standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Secure, well-structured, no signs of malicious activity. Confidence: 1.0. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's content. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on response handling, with attention to response streaming and parsing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evident data leaks or malicious data flows. File writing functions are controlled.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, no external malicious calls.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate response handling code, no signs of malicious activity. Confidence: 0.95. Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Response parsing, streaming, and wrapping functions for an SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evident data exfiltration or malicious sinks. Wrappers modify headers for request customization, which is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious code or obfuscation. Uses standard practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Secure, standard implementation. Confidence: 0.9. Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious indicators; the code is typical for an SDK.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Response handling with support for sync/async, streaming, and response management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious data flows. Response wrappers are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious code or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, secure code. Confidence: 1.0. Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Response classes, parsing, streaming, and resource management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evident malicious data flow. File operations are controlled.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external malicious calls.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard response handling framework, no signs of malware. Confidence: 0.9. Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code content; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are evident in the code. The code is primarily response management, parsing, streaming, and resource handling.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware, obfuscation, or sabotage detected across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** The minimal risk scores reflect the absence of dangerous behavior.\n- **Consistency:** The scores assigned (mostly 0 or close to 0.5) are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — The code is a standard, secure response handling module.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code appears to be a well-structured, secure HTTP response handling library with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms the code's integrity and security posture based on the provided reports.",
