{
  "purpose": "The code manages HTTP responses, parsing, streaming, and resource cleanup for an API client library.",
  "sources": "Response data from httpx.Response, headers, request info, response content streams.",
  "sinks": "Response content parsing, file writing, response object returns, header modifications.",
  "flows": "Response data flows from httpx.Response into parsing functions, stream handlers, or file outputs; headers influence response behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected. Wrapper functions and header manipulations are standard SDK practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured response handling module supporting synchronous and asynchronous operations, streaming, and response customization. It performs safe data handling, resource management, and response parsing without executing untrusted code or insecure operations. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of headers for controlling response behavior is typical in SDKs. No external malicious calls or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure HTTP response management framework with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. It follows standard practices for SDK response handling and resource safety.",
