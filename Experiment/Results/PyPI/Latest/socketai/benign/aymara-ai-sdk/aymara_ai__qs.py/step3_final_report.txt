  "purpose": "A utility class for parsing and serializing URL query strings with configurable array and nested formats.",
  "sources": "Input query string for parsing; parameters dictionary for serialization.",
  "sinks": "Uses urllib.parse.parse_qs for parsing; uses urllib.parse.urlencode for serialization.",
  "flows": "Input query string -> parse_qs -> output mapping; parameters -> _stringify_item -> urlencode -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python libraries for URL query string handling, with configurable options for array and nested formats. It does not perform any unsafe operations, execute untrusted code, or contain obfuscated segments. The data flow is straightforward, with safe serialization and parsing functions. No malicious patterns or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard URL query string utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It uses safe, well-understood libraries and practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal, approximately 0.1.",
