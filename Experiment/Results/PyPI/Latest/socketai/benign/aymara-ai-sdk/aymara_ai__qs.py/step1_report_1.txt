  "purpose": "This code defines a utility for parsing and stringifying URL query strings with customizable formatting options.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters such as 'query' in parse() and 'params' in stringify()/stringify_items() methods.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the 'urlencode' function, which generates URL-encoded strings from parameters. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through processing methods and eventually to 'urlencode', which produces URL strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for handling query strings with customizable options. Parsing uses 'parse_qs' directly, which is safe. Stringifying data involves serializing Python data structures into URL-encoded format, with options for array and nested formatting. The 'Options' class handles defaults sensibly. No unsafe code execution, external network calls, or malicious data handling are evident. No evidence of data leakage, credential storage, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility for URL query string management without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or suspicious anomalies.",
