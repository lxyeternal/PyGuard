{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for parsing and serializing query strings in URLs, supporting various formats and nested structures.",
  "sources": "Input data for the 'parse' method (query string), data passed to 'stringify' and 'stringify_items' methods (parameters to be encoded).",
  "sinks": "The 'urlencode' function outputs the serialized query string. No other direct sinks are evident; no data is written to external sources or executed.",
  "flows": "Input query string -> 'parse' method -> parsed mapping; parameters -> 'stringify'/'stringify_items' -> URL-encoded string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code segments, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns are present. Use of standard library functions appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard query string parsing and serialization logic with support for nested and array formats. It includes configurable options but relies on standard Python functions like 'parse_qs' and 'urlencode'. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or secret handling is observed. The code is straightforward and aligns with common practices for URL parameter handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for URL query string management without malicious intent. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the analysis. Its design uses standard libraries and simple data transformations, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
