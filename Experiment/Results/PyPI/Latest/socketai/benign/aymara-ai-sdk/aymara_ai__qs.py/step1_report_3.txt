  "purpose": "The code provides a utility for parsing and serializing URL query strings with configurable formatting options.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (`query` string, `params` dictionary), and configuration options (`array_format`, `nested_format`).",
  "sinks": "The code converts data into URL-encoded strings via `urlencode`, which is a safe standard library function. No untrusted data is directly used in system commands or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input query string -> `parse()` returns a mapping; Params dictionary -> `stringify()` and `stringify_items()` generate URL-encoded strings. Data flows are straightforward data transformations with no external or system influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated sections. No data leaks or unsafe operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement URL query string parsing and serialization with configurable options for array and nested formats. The parsing uses Python's `parse_qs` which is safe. Serialization uses `urlencode` with controlled data. The code handles data types explicitly, avoiding dynamic execution or insecure operations. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection, are detected. The code relies on standard Python libraries and controlled logic. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe URL query string utility without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data in insecure ways and uses safe, well-understood Python functions. No malware, obfuscation, or supply chain security issues are evident.",
