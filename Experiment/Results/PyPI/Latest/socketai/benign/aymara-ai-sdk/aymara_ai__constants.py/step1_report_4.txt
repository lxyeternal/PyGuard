  "purpose": "Define constants and configurations for HTTP requests, likely used in an API client or HTTP communication module.",
  "sources": "Constants and imported modules; specifically, the httpx library used for HTTP operations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the use of httpx.Timeout and httpx.Limits could influence HTTP request behavior, but no direct sink for untrusted data is evident here.",
  "flows": "Constants like DEFAULT_TIMEOUT, DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES, and connection limits are set at the start and used to configure HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code simply sets configuration parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the httpx library, defines string constants likely used as HTTP headers, and sets configuration parameters for HTTP request timeout, retries, and connection limits. These parameters are typical for configuring an HTTP client. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The constants and configurations appear standard and benign, aimed at controlling request behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for HTTP request configurations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily sets constants and parameters for an HTTP client, with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
