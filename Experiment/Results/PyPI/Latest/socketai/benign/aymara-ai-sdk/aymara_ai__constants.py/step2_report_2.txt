  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks:**  \n   All reports consistently conclude that the code is a straightforward configuration snippet for an HTTP client, with no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code is static, uses common libraries, and does not process untrusted input.\n\n2. **Code Content and Logic:**  \n   The code only defines constants and default parameters for an HTTP client setup, including headers, timeouts, retries, and connection limits. There are no dynamic behaviors, no secret credentials, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. This is appropriate.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code is straightforward and readable.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Concerns:**  \n   - No issues are present in the code itself.  \n   - The reports do not identify any vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors based on assumptions.  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**  \n   - Since the code is purely configuration, the risk scores should remain low unless further context indicates otherwise.  \n   - No need to increase scores based on these snippets alone.\n\n**Final Assessment:**  \n- The code is a benign, standard configuration for an HTTP client.  \n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at 0.  \n- The reports' scoring appears reasonable and justified.\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the current scores. There are no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the security risk is minimal. The code is safe and typical for its purpose.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis of additional code snippets or context is needed.",
