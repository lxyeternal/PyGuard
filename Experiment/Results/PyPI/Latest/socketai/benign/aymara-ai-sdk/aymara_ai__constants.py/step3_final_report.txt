  "purpose": "Configuration setup for an HTTP client using the httpx library, defining headers, timeouts, retries, and connection limits.",
  "sources": "Constants and default parameters defined directly in the code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs processed; no data leaks or security-sensitive sinks present",
  "flows": "Static definitions with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration snippet with static constants for headers, timeouts, retries, and connection limits. It does not process user input, environment variables, or untrusted data. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, security risk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration snippet for an HTTP client with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
