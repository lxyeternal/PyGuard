  "purpose": "Define constants and default configurations for HTTP requests, likely used in a larger API client implementation.",
  "sources": "Importing httpx library, defining string constants, setting default timeout, retries, connection limits, and retry delays.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink for untrusted data; configuration constants are static. No external data or user input processing present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable—no data flows from sources to sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward configuration code with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up parameters for HTTP request handling, including headers, timeout durations, retry logic, and connection limits. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The constants appear typical for an HTTP client setup. No obfuscated code or secret credentials are present. Overall, this code is a benign configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration snippet for an HTTP client using the httpx library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
