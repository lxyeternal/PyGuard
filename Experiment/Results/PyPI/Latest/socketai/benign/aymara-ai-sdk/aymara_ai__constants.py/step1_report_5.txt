  "purpose": "Define constants and default settings for an HTTP client configuration based on an OpenAPI spec.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string constants and imports the httpx library.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leaks or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard HTTP library (httpx) and sets static configuration constants for HTTP request timeout, retries, and connection limits. These are typical in client configuration and do not involve any data handling or user input. The header strings are hardcoded but benign. No dynamic code execution, data leakage, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration setup for an HTTP client, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard and safe.",
