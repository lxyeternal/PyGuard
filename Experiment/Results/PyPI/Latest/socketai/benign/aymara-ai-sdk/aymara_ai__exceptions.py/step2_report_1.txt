  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, boilerplate implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or flows involve untrusted or malicious data.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present.\n- The code relies on standard libraries (`httpx`, `typing_extensions`) and typical exception handling patterns.\n- The only minor concern is the `securityRisk` score of 0.1 in report 5, which appears to be an overestimation given the absence of any risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports identify that the code is a standard set of exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is correctly implemented, with proper type annotations, inheritance, and exception initialization.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct. The security risk is mostly 0, except for report 5 which has 0.1, but given the code's nature, this is unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  Correctly 0; no obfuscation or unusual code patterns.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0 or very low (0.1 in one case). Given the code's nature, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  None. All reports correctly identify that the code is purely for error handling, with no vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nConsidering all evidence, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is standard, safe, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Therefore, I assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely for API error handling and poses no security threat.",
