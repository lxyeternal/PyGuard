{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling API errors and responses, specifically for an application interacting with an API using httpx.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, exception handling, and type annotations. No external input sources are present in this code fragment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data, execute commands, or perform network operations are present. The code only defines exception classes and data structures.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely establishes class hierarchies and error handling structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns are observed. The code uses standard Python exception handling, type hints, and class structures. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling. It includes structured error types corresponding to various HTTP status codes, with clear inheritance and type annotations. There is no dynamic code execution, external input processing, or potentially malicious behavior. The code appears to be boilerplate or library code for managing API errors in a safe manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and intended for handling API errors. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks within this module.",
