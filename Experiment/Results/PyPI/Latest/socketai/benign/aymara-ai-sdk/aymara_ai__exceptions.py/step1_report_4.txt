{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling API errors in a client library interacting with an external service.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions and exception handling logic; no input sources or untrusted data input points are evident.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiations and attribute assignments, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks like network or file system.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted input to critical operations is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code adheres to typical exception handling and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for various HTTP error responses, with appropriate typing and inheritance. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious logic is included. It appears to be standard error handling code for an API client. No indications of malicious behavior or anomalies were identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It appears to be part of a safe client library.",
