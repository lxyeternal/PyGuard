{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various API error responses, including connection issues, validation errors, and specific HTTP status codes.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily defines classes and their initializers, with no external data input or output operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; exception handling is internal and does not involve data leaks or external system calls.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; error classes are instantiated with data from API responses, but no malicious or unsafe processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The code follows standard Python class and exception patterns. No hardcoded credentials or secret values are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for API error handling, relying on the 'httpx' library for request and response objects. It properly initializes exceptions with relevant data and types, following best practices. No external data is processed or transmitted, and there are no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code appears to be purely for error management within an API client context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling. It poses no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
