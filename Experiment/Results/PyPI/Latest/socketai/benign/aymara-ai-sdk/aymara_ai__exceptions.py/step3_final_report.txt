{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various API error responses, including status errors, validation errors, and connection issues.",
  "sources": "Request and response objects from the httpx library, used in exception initialization to capture request/response data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; exception objects may contain untrusted request/response data but do not process or leak it.",
  "flows": "Exception classes are instantiated with request/response data; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks beyond standard error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard class definitions, type annotations, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of API error handling classes, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It uses typical patterns and libraries, and the exception classes serve as data containers for API error information. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The request/response data stored in exceptions could include untrusted data, but this is normal for error handling and does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, boilerplate set of exception classes for API error management. It poses no malware, security risks, or obfuscation concerns. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report is slightly cautious but justifiable; overall, the code is safe and standard.",
