{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling API errors and responses in a Python client for an API service.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (__future__, typing_extensions), third-party httpx library, and class definitions which process API responses and errors.",
  "sinks": "Exception constructors and properties that store request and response data, which could potentially hold untrusted or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated with request/response data, which could contain untrusted input, but these flows are standard error handling patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code strictly defines error classes and does not perform any network or file operations outside of type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up custom exception classes to handle various API errors using httpx request and response objects. It includes error subclasses for common HTTP error statuses, with clear and conventional constructors. The use of exception classes to encapsulate request/response data is typical for API clients. No malicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are observed. The code relies on standard library and third-party modules, and only deals with error representation. There is no indication of malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom API error handling classes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a larger API client package. It appears safe and free from malicious or sabotage code.",
