{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various API error responses and connection issues, primarily for use in an HTTP client interacting with an API.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute definitions, class initializers, and exception raising logic.",
  "sinks": "Construction of exception objects with potentially untrusted data (e.g., response bodies, requests). No data is sent or leaked; no network operations are directly performed.",
  "flows": "Input data from HTTP responses or requests is used to instantiate exception objects, which may include response bodies or request details; no external flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. Use of type annotations, exception inheritance, and standard Python constructs are typical. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes for API error handling, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data manipulation. All operations are standard class initializations and attribute assignments. The use of 'httpx' objects for request and response details is typical for HTTP error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a standard error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of custom exception classes for API error handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply models API error responses and connection errors. No evidence of malware, supply chain attacks, or malicious intent is present.",
