  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling.\n- No external data processing, dynamic code execution, or network operations are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The code relies on the 'httpx' library for request and response objects, which is common in API clients.\n- The exception classes are well-structured, with proper inheritance and type annotations.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis that there are no malicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Most reports assign a security risk score of 0, except report 5, which assigns 0.1. Given the code's nature, this seems overly cautious since the code only defines error classes without any code that could be exploited or used maliciously.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The code matches the description: class definitions, exception handling, type annotations, no external input processing, no data leaks, no code injection.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate or library code for error handling.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- The only minor concern is the securityRisk score of 0.1 in report 5, which seems unnecessary given the code's benign nature. A score of 0 would be more appropriate unless there is context outside this snippet that could introduce risk.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk evident)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, safe implementation of API error handling classes. It poses no malware, security risk, or obfuscation concerns. The reports are consistent in their analysis, and the minor security risk score in report 5 is slightly overcautious but not unreasonable if considering potential misuse, though unlikely.\n\n**My estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's nature.",
