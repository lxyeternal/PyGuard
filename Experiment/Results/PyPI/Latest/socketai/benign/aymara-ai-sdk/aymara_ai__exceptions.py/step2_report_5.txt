  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling.\n- No external data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The code relies on well-known libraries (`httpx`) and standard Python practices.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No issues, purely standard error classes, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code content.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no external input, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, boilerplate code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same consistent conclusion.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard error class definitions, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), but still no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score is marginally above zero, but given the code only constructs exception classes with request/response data, which could potentially contain sensitive info, a small score is acceptable. However, there's no indication of actual malicious intent or vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very close to 0. The last report's 0.1 is reasonable, reflecting minimal potential concern due to handling of request/response data, but not actual risk.\n\n### My conclusion:\n- The code is purely boilerplate, well-structured, and safe.\n- No malware or malicious activity is present.\n- The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 in report 5 is justifiable but could be standardized to 0 for consistency, as no actual vulnerabilities or risky patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or 0.1 if conservative, but 0 is more consistent)\n\n**Therefore, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the detailed analysis.",
