  "purpose": "Static metadata declaration for a Python package, defining __title__ and __version__ variables.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static string values to __title__ and __version__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, generated from an OpenAPI spec, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata. No input/output, external calls, or dynamic behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The malware score is 0, security risk score is 0, and obfuscated score is 0, with high confidence. The code is typical boilerplate metadata, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static metadata with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
