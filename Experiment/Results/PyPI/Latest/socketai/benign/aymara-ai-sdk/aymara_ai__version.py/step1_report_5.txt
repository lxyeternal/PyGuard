  "purpose": "This code defines metadata variables for a Python package named 'aymara_ai'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string assignments for __title__ and __version__ variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets metadata variables without input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is simple, straightforward, and follows typical package metadata conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only variable assignments defining package title and version. No input handling, no external data sources, no dynamic execution, no secret handling, and no malicious behavior. The file appears to be boilerplate or generated metadata, with no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as package metadata with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
