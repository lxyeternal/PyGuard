  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for the Python package 'aymara_ai', including title and version information.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments (__title__, __version__).",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; code is a simple metadata declaration with no suspicious or unusual elements.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata variables with static string values. No input reading, environment variable access, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. It appears to be auto-generated documentation or boilerplate, typical in Python packages. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward metadata declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is typical boilerplate code used in Python package setup.",
