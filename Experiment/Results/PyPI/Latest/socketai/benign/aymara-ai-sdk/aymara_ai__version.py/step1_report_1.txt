  "sources": "Assignment statements setting __title__ and __version__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only assigns static string values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward and generated from an OpenAPI spec; no suspicious or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two variable assignments that specify the package title and version. There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic behavior. The comments indicate it was generated from an OpenAPI specification using Stainless. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks. The code appears to be benign metadata setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
