  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code content, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple static variable assignments for package metadata (__title__, __version__).\n- No inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic behavior are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security issues are evident.\n- The code is generated from an OpenAPI spec, indicating boilerplate or auto-generated code.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Metadata definition for a Python package.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies static assignment of strings, no data flow, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. No issues.\n\n#### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Metadata declaration for 'aymara_ai'.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, correctly notes static string assignments, no external interactions.\n- **Scores:** All zeroes for malware, securityRisk, obfuscated; confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n#### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Metadata declaration.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; straightforward static variable assignments.\n- **Scores:** Zeroes across the board, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n#### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Metadata for package.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern; no dynamic or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Zeroes, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Metadata variables.\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with previous; static assignments, no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Zeroes, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence:** Confirmed; only static variable assignments.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected; code is benign.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; straightforward assignments.\n- **Security risk:** None.\n- **Score consistency:** All scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is simple, auto-generated metadata, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified.\n- Confidence level of 1 is appropriate given the clarity and simplicity.\n\n**Potential adjustments:** None needed; the reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security concerns. The reports are thorough and accurate.",
