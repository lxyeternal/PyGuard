  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is primarily type annotations, data structures, and protocols for an HTTP client library, with no runtime logic or network calls.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious data flows are present.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears standard, benign, and well-structured, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, no runtime data flows, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on type safety and protocol definitions, with no runtime or network activity.\n- No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, which aligns with the static, benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, primarily type definitions, protocols, and class structures.\n- No dynamic code, network calls, or data leaks.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1) perhaps due to the nature of the code being a utility library, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, with focus on type safety and request setup.\n- No suspicious code or malicious patterns.\n- Slightly more cautious with securityRisk=0, which is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Focuses on potential data flows into HTTP requests, but no actual runtime or network code.\n- Notes potential sinks (headers, request bodies, files), but these are standard for such libraries.\n- No evidence of malicious activity.\n- Slightly higher securityRisk=0.2, which could reflect the inherent risk in handling untrusted data in request parameters, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate given the static analysis. The securityRisk is slightly elevated but justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code or behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are low (0 or 0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code, which is mostly type definitions and protocols.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0 across all, as no malicious behavior is present.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk:** Given the code's purpose, the overall risk should remain very low, around 0.1, mainly due to the potential for untrusted data handling in a broader context, but not from the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports' scores are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, standard part of an HTTP client library with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores. The overall security posture of this code snippet is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation concerns.",
