{
  "purpose": "The code defines type aliases, protocols, and data structures for an HTTP client based on httpx, including support for files, request options, and response handling.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class and function definitions, import statements, and variable initializations.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no code performs data output or network operations directly; the code mainly sets up structures for further use.",
  "flows": "Data flows are not explicitly demonstrated; the code primarily defines types and protocols for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of type definitions, protocol declarations, and class definitions that facilitate HTTP request handling with httpx. No input/output operations, network calls, or data leaks are directly implemented. The structures seem standard for a type-safe HTTP client interface. No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type definitions and protocols for an HTTP client library. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. It is a supportive module for an HTTP client, not performing any malicious actions itself.",
