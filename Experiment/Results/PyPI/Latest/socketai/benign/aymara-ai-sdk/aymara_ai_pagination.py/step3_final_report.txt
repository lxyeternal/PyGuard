  "purpose": "Implement offset-based pagination classes for synchronous and asynchronous contexts, managing 'items' and 'count' attributes to determine next page info.",
  "sources": "Class attributes 'items' and 'count' used to compute pagination; no external input processing.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Retrieve 'items' and 'count', compute 'current_count', compare with 'count', generate 'PageInfo' with 'offset' if applicable.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant checks for 'count is None' in 'next_page_info()' methods; no malicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard offset pagination classes with straightforward logic. It reads from class attributes without external input, performs simple calculations, and creates 'PageInfo' objects. The redundant 'count is None' checks are unnecessary but benign. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by the lack of external data handling or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of pagination classes with no malicious or security issues. Redundant code exists but does not impact security. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
