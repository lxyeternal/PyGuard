  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the logic, reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a standard HTTP SDK with no suspicious input sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are typical; no malicious data sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Use of platform detection and retries are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The reasoning is sound; no signs of malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to report 1, emphasizing standard request handling, retries, and environment detection.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious indicators, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on platform detection, request retries, and response parsing.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard SDK features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights platform detection, network requests, and response handling.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 fit.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar assessment: standard SDK, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a well-structured, standard HTTP client SDK.\n- The detailed reasoning points out the absence of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious network activity.\n- The assigned malware scores of 0 are consistent with the code's content.\n- The obfuscated scores of 0 are appropriate, given the code clarity.\n- The security risk scores are low (around 0.1–0.2), aligning with the analysis that the code is benign.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious intent or payload detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, well-structured, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to network operations inherent in SDKs, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious features.\n\n**Summary:** The reports' assessments are accurate and well justified. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code is safe, standard, and free from malicious features.",
