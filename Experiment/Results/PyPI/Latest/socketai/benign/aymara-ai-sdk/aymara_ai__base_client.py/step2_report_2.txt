  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, focusing on the technical details, flow of data, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive HTTP SDK with sync/async support, pagination, platform detection, and request config utilities.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Platform detection and request handling are standard utilities.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both are 0, with high confidence (0.95). The report correctly identifies no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing request retries, environment detection, and response parsing.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Use of `random()` for jitter is standard. No suspicious dynamic code or external command execution.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, confidence 0.95. The reasoning aligns with the code's structure.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on request construction, platform detection, and response handling.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Platform detection functions are typical.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, confidence 0.95. The reasoning is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior; the code is standard SDK code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Details about request handling, platform detection, and response parsing.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of `random()` for jitter is standard.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, confidence 0.9. The analysis is consistent.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears benign, with no malicious signals.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on request building, retries, and environment info.\n- **Findings:** No malicious or obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious external interactions.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, confidence 0.95. The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard API SDK with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** No, all reports agree that the code is standard, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** No, the reasoning is consistent and thorough.\n- **Scores:** The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1-0.2) are reasonable given the analysis.\n- **Justification for Scores > 0.5:** None of the reports justify higher scores; all indicate benign code.\n\n### Final Justification & Personal Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation or code hiding.\n- **Risk Score:** ~0.1 — low, mainly due to network interactions and environment detection, which are standard for SDKs.\n\n**In conclusion, the code is a well-structured, standard HTTP client SDK with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.**",
