  "purpose": "AI-assisted selection of project files based on requirements, utilizing AI responses and file descriptions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, FileFetcher.get_all_files_without_ignore, FileMemory.get_file_descriptions, internal methods, external modules.",
  "sinks": "Logs files (file_selected.txt), AI responses, potential file operations.",
  "flows": "User provides requirement -> build prompt -> AI generates response -> response split into file list -> logs written -> files returned.",
  "anomalies": "Log directory path constructed from project_dir and issues_id without sanitization; no user input directly influencing paths, no obfuscated code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AI-assisted file selection with logging and prompt generation. No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors are present. Path construction could be improved with sanitization but currently poses minimal risk. External modules are assumed trustworthy. The AI model used is a known model name. Overall, the code is straightforward and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility for AI-assisted project file selection. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The minor path construction concern does not constitute an immediate threat.",
