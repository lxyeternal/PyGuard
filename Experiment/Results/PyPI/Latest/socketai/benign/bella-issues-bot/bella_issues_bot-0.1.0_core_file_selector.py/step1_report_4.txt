{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to assist in selecting relevant project files based on user requirements, utilizing AI to analyze project structure and descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user requirement strings, project directory files obtained via FileFetcher, and file descriptions from FileMemory.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing selected file logs to disk, passing untrusted user input to AI models, and returning file lists.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input (requirement), through AI prompt construction, to AI response, and then to file logging and final output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors detected; the code appears straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no hidden network activities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to help select project files based on requirements, using an AI assistant and a custom tool for file selection logging. The select_files tool logs selected files to a path constructed from project directory and issues ID, then returns the original file list string. The main method initializes the class with specific AI configurations and invokes file selection based on a requirement. All file operations are local, and AI interactions seem to be standard prompt-based calls. No signs of malicious actions such as network transmission of data, backdoors, or system harm are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a file selection helper leveraging AI, with logging and prompt-based logic. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided analysis.",
