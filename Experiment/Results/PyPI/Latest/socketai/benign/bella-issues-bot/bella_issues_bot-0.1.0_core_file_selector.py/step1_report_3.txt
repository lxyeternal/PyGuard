{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for selecting project files based on AI analysis to meet a specified requirement, primarily for assisting in project management and code understanding.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables via load_dotenv(), function arguments such as requirement strings, and file lists provided to the select_files tool.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing selected file logs to disk (file_selected.txt), returning file list strings, and generating AI responses based on project files.",
  "flows": "Flow involves reading project files, building prompts, using AI to select relevant files, and logging selections. Data flows from file fetchers and environment variables into AI prompts and logs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The use of AI models (claude-3.5-sonnet) appears to be legitimate. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes environment variables, project file fetching, AI-based decision making, and file logging. All operations appear standard for an AI-assisted file selection tool. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code are present. The AI model used is a known model name, and logs are stored locally without sensitive data. The purpose is well-documented, and the code structure is clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of an AI-assisted file selector for project management. There are no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
