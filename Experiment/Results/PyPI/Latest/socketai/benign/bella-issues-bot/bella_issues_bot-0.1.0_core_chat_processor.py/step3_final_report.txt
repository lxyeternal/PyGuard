  "purpose": "A chat handler module that processes user inquiries, provides responses via an AI assistant, and logs interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from core.ai and core.log_manager; user_query input parameter.",
  "sinks": "generate_response method of AIAssistant; archive_logs method of LogManager.",
  "flows": "User input (user_query) -> generate_response -> response -> archive_logs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a chat processor with configurable prompts, delegates response generation to an external AI module, and logs interactions. It relies on trusted external modules, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The data flow is straightforward, involving input, response, and logging. No suspicious patterns or malicious logic are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature. External dependencies are assumed trustworthy but could be a vector if malicious, though no evidence exists here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign chat processing component with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware and risk scores are justified, and the overall confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
