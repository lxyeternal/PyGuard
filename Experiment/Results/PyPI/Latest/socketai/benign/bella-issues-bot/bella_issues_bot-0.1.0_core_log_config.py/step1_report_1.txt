{
  "purpose": "The code configures logging for a Python application, including console and file handlers with rotation, and provides functions to set up and retrieve loggers.",
  "sources": "Reads the script file path (__file__), environment variables for log_dir and log_file, and logging configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Outputs logs to console (stdout) and to log files in specified directory; no data leaks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration functions set up logging handlers; log messages flow from application code through the logger to console and file handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly sets up logging with color formatting and rotating file handlers, ensuring logs are stored safely and with rotation. It uses standard libraries and practices. No external inputs are used insecurely, and there are no suspicious data flows. The only data source is configuration parameters and the script path; outputs are to logs. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe logging setup for a Python application with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
