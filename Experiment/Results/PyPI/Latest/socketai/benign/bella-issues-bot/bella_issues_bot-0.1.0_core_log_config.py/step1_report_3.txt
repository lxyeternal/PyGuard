  "purpose": "Configure and set up logging with colored console output and file rotation, providing functions to initialize and retrieve loggers.",
  "sources": "User code and environment variables (such as __file__, sys.stdout, os.environ if any).",
  "sinks": "Log outputs to console and log files in the specified directory.",
  "flows": "Initialization of log directory -> creation of loggers -> output to console and log files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard logging setup. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging with colorized console output and rotating file handlers. It dynamically determines the project directory, creates log directories if needed, and configures log formatters. Functions are provided for setup and retrieval of loggers. No external data sources, untrusted input, or insecure behaviors are present. No data leaks or malicious actions detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging configuration implementation with no malicious intent or security issues. It provides configurable logging setup for a Python application, adhering to best practices without any suspicious behavior.",
