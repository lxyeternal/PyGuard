  "purpose": "Configure logging for a Python application with colored console output and log file rotation.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.makedirs, sys.stdout, os.path.join, os.path.dirname, __file__",
  "sinks": "logging handlers (StreamHandler and RotatingFileHandler) writing to console and log files",
  "flows": "Code reads environment and file system paths, then writes logs to console and files based on configuration",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a logging configuration that outputs colored logs to console and rotates log files on disk. It uses standard libraries and well-known third-party modules (colorlog, logging.handlers). No input is taken from untrusted sources; log files are stored in a designated directory. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. The code appears to be a typical logging setup for a Python application, with clear, documented functions and safe use of environment variables and file system paths.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging configuration module that does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It responsibly manages log output and storage without exposing sensitive information or executing malicious operations.",
