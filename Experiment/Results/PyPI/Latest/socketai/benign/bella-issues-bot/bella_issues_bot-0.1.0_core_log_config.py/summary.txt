  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-implemented logging setup with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence scores and low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The minimal security risk score reflects the benign nature of the code, primarily due to its role in logging rather than data processing or network activity."
