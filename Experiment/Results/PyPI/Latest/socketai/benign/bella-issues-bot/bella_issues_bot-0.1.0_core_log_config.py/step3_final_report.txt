{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a comprehensive logging system with console (colorized) and rotating file handlers, facilitating application diagnostics and monitoring.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters, the script's file path (__file__), and creates directories for logs.",
  "sinks": "Logs are output to stdout (console) and log files stored in the specified directory; no untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters flow into logger setup functions, which then direct logs to console and file handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard logging practices, ensuring log directory existence, configuring root and named loggers, and adding colorized console and rotating file handlers. It does not process external untrusted inputs, connect to networks, or handle secrets. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The use of third-party 'colorlog' is common and safe. The overall structure is clear, maintainable, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-implemented logging setup with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence scores and low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The minimal security risk score reflects the benign nature of the code, primarily due to its role in logging rather than data processing or network activity.",
