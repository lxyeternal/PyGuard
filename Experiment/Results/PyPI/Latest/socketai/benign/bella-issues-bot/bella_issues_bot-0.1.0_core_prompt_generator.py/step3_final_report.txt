  "purpose": "Generate prompts for AI models based on project files, descriptions, and user requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, filesystem data, and prompt strings; processing file contents, descriptions, and prompt text.",
  "sinks": "Reading files from disk; parsing prompt strings; rendering templates with file contents.",
  "flows": "Source data (files, prompt text) -> regex extraction and file reading -> template rendering -> structured prompt output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility for prompt generation and parsing, involving standard file I/O, regex parsing, and template rendering. It includes exception handling for file operations. No malicious code, network activity, or system modifications are present. The regex patterns assume specific prompt formats but are appropriate. The code does not perform any dynamic code execution based on untrusted input beyond template rendering, which appears controlled. No obfuscation or malicious logic is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, security risk ~0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, which handles files carefully and does not contain malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for prompt generation and parsing. It performs standard file operations and template rendering without any malicious intent or activity. The risk scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
