{
  "purpose": "The code provides tools for generating structured prompts based on project files, descriptions, and user requirements, including reading file contents and extracting information from prompts.",
  "sources": "File system reads in 'format_file_content' and 'generatePrompt' functions; reads from environment variables via 'load_dotenv'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially reads and outputs file contents; no evident transmission or untrusted data handling outside file reading functions.",
  "flows": "File reading functions ('format_file_content', 'generatePrompt') read files; 'extractInfo' parses prompt text to extract structured data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic file reading and content formatting; no hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated code or suspicious network activity; no hidden backdoors or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on file handling, prompt generation with templating, and extracting information from prompts. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, code injection, or backdoors. All file reads are from local paths, with error handling in place. The use of environment variables is limited to loading configurations. No suspicious obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic observed. The code's purpose aligns with legitimate prompt management and file processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate prompt generation utility with standard file handling and templating functions. No malicious intent or security risks identified. It operates solely on local files and prompt text without any suspicious or malicious side effects.",
