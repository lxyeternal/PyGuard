{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate structured prompts based on project files, descriptions, and user requirements, primarily for use in AI-driven workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads file existence status and content from the filesystem; reads environment variables; processes input prompt strings.",
  "sinks": "Reads file contents from disk; no direct sink to network, database, or system commands; potential risk if file contents contain malicious code.",
  "flows": "File reading functions feed file content into prompt templates; prompt text is parsed for information extraction.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic code execution via Jinja2 templates; no apparent hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports external libraries dotenv and jinja2, uses filesystem operations, and processes text data for prompt generation and extraction. The template rendering functions involve reading file content and incorporating it into prompts, which could pose security concerns if files contain malicious code, but no malicious activity is explicitly present. The environment variable loading is standard and does not involve sensitive data. The code does not connect to external servers or execute system commands based on untrusted input. There are no signs of backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network activity. The use of dynamic templating is a potential attack vector if untrusted files are processed, but this alone is not malicious. Overall, no malware or malicious behavior is evident, and the functions are consistent with their intended purposes. The main risk is potential misuse of file content, but this is not malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a prompt generation and extraction tool with filesystem interactions. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, but care should be taken if files contain malicious content, which could lead to unsafe prompt outputs. There are no indicators of sabotage or supply chain attacks within this code segment.",
