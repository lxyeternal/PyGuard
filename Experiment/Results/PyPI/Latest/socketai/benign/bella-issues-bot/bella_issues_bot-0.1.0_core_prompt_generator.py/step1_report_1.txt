{
  "purpose": "The code generates prompts for AI models based on project files, descriptions, and user requirements, primarily for code analysis or assistance.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables via dotenv.load_dotenv(), accesses the filesystem with os.path and open(), and processes prompt strings with regex searches.",
  "sinks": "Reads files from disk, uses regex to extract information from prompt text, and renders templates with Jinja2 which could process untrusted input if manipulated.",
  "flows": "File paths are used to read file contents; prompt strings are parsed for info; templates are rendered with data potentially including file contents and descriptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident. The code dynamically reads files and generates prompts, but no suspicious or malicious logic, such as network activity or system modification, is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and third-party libraries (dotenv, jinja2). It defines data classes for prompt data and extracted info, and a PromptGenerator class with methods for generating prompts and extracting info from prompts. The generatePrompt method renders a template that reads files from disk and includes their content with line numbers. The extractInfo method uses regex to parse prompt text for file descriptions, steps, and requirements. The main block loads environment variables, sets up file selection, and generates a prompt. There is no code that performs network communication, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or modifies system files. The only potentially risky operations are file reads, which are standard and controlled, and template rendering that could process malicious input if prompt text is manipulated externally, but there is no evidence of such activity within this code.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a prompt generator and parser for AI interactions involving project files and descriptions. It does not contain any malicious code or malware behaviors. Its operations are standard file I/O, string processing, and template rendering, all with clear intent. There are no indicators of malicious sabotage or malicious intent within this module.",
