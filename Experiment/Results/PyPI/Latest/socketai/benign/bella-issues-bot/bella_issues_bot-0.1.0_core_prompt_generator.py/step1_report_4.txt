{
  "purpose": "The code generates structured prompts based on project files, descriptions, and user requirements, primarily for AI-assisted code analysis or generation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables with load_dotenv(), accesses the filesystem with os.path and open(), and processes prompt strings.",
  "sinks": "Reads files from disk for their contents, potentially exposing sensitive information if files contain secrets. Uses open() for reading file content without validation.",
  "flows": "Source: File system reads in formatFileContent and generatePrompt; Sink: reading file contents, loading environment variables. Data flows from filesystem to string variables, then to template rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features are detected. The code properly handles exceptions when reading files.",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables, selects project files, retrieves descriptions, and generates prompts with file content included. The file content is read and formatted with line numbers, which is standard. The extraction logic uses regex to parse prompt text. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is present. The only potential concern is reading and outputting file contents, which could expose secrets if files contain them. No external network connections, no system manipulation, and no data exfiltration are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign prompt generation utility with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It handles file I/O safely with exception handling, and there are no signs of malware or sabotage. Its main function is to assist AI workflows by preparing project context.",
