{
  "purpose": "The code generates structured prompts based on project files, descriptions, and user requirements for AI-driven code analysis or assistance.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (load_dotenv), file paths and contents (os.path, open), and user input (requirement).",
  "sinks": "Reads files from the filesystem, processes and renders templates with potentially untrusted file contents, but does not execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Loads environment variables → selects files based on requirement → reads file contents → generates prompts → extracts info from prompts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Uses common libraries (dotenv, jinja2).",
  "analysis": "The code reads files from specified directories, processes their contents with line numbering, and renders templates for prompt generation. It also extracts structured info from prompts. No evidence of malicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The file reading functions handle exceptions properly, and there is no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Overall, it appears to be a standard, benign utility for prompt creation and info extraction related to project files.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a utility for generating and parsing prompts related to project files, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on filesystem data and template rendering without executing any untrusted code or performing suspicious actions.",
