  "purpose": "Manage and store logs related to code generation issues, including saving prompts, responses, timestamps, and retrieving logs for specific rounds.",
  "sources": "Filesystem operations such as directory listing, reading prompt/response/timestamp files, and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Writing prompt, response, timestamp files; creating directories.",
  "flows": "Filesystem reads and writes for logs, directory creation for rounds, retrieval of logs based on directory structure.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard file I/O and directory management with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward logging utility that manages logs for code generation issues across multiple rounds. It uses standard Python modules (os, datetime, logging) for directory and file operations, with error handling for file reads. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. The logic is simple, safe, and typical for such utilities. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured log management utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score can be conservatively set to 0.1, reflecting minimal filesystem operations without vulnerabilities.",
