  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior and security risks, focusing on code analysis, source/sink identification, anomalies, and scoring.",
  "sources": "Untrusted input sources such as environment variables, user input, network connections, and configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Functions like eval(), exec(), network operations, file writes, and environment modifications that could process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Untrusted sources flow into eval()/exec() or network/file sinks, potentially leading to code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() with unvalidated input, hardcoded credentials, insecure network connections, and absence of code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is either missing or benign, with no evidence of malicious payloads. When present, risky practices such as eval()/exec() with untrusted input are noted but not confirmed as malicious. No obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The risk scores reflect the potential danger of unsafe code practices, particularly in Report 2, where eval()/exec() usage warrants a moderate concern. Malware scores remain at 0 across all reports due to lack of confirmed malicious activity. Confidence levels are appropriate given the evidence, and the scores are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates no confirmed malicious behavior. The primary concern is the unsafe use of eval()/exec(), which justifies a moderate security risk score (~0.4-0.5). Malware remains at 0, and obfuscation is not detected. The scores and reasoning are aligned and appropriate.",
