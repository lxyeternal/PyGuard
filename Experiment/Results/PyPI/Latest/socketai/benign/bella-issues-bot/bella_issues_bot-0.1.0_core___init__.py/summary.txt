  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates no confirmed malicious behavior. The primary concern is the unsafe use of eval()/exec(), which justifies a moderate security risk score (~0.4-0.5). Malware remains at 0, and obfuscation is not detected. The scores and reasoning are aligned and appropriate."
