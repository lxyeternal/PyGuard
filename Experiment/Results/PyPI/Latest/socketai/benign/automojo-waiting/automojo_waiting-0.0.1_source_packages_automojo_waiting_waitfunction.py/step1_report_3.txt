{
  "purpose": "This module provides a utility function 'wait_for_it' to repeatedly invoke a callback until a condition is met or a timeout occurs, used for synchronization or waiting for specific states in an application.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include: the 'looper' callback function, 'largs' positional arguments, 'lkwargs' keyword arguments, and optional 'wctx' (WaitContext) object. External data might be indirectly sourced via 'looper' or 'wctx' methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points include the 'looper' callback invocation, 'wctx' methods (such as 'mark_begin', 'mark_complete', 'mark_time', 'mark_final_attempt', and 'create_timeout') which may perform actions based on callback outcomes or raise exceptions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'looper' callback to the loop control logic, with 'wctx' managing state and timing; the callback's return value determines loop continuation; in case of timeout, an exception is raised. The flow is controlled internally without external data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and uses standard libraries and typical design patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The function 'wait_for_it' is a straightforward implementation of a polling/wait pattern, invoking a callback repeatedly until a condition is satisfied or a timeout occurs. It handles optional parameters, manages timing with sleep, and uses a context object to track state and timing. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The exception raising on timeout is standard for such patterns. The code relies on external modules 'automojo.waiting.constants' and 'automojo.waiting.waitmodel' for constants and context management, which appear to be part of the application logic, not malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard wait/poll utility function with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs its function safely, with no hardcoded secrets or external data leaks. No malware or malicious patterns detected.",
