{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility function 'wait_for_it' to wait for a condition to be met by repeatedly invoking a callback, with configurable timing parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads are from input parameters: 'looper', 'largs', 'wctx', 'lkwargs'. Uses imported constants and classes from 'automojo.waiting'. No external data sources or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "The function calls the 'looper' callback repeatedly, which is a trusted, user-provided function; no direct sinks such as network, file, or system calls are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Flow involves invoking 'looper' with 'wctx' and additional args, checking conditions, and potentially raising a 'TimeoutError' from 'wctx'. No untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code constructs, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution. Use of standard sleep and callback pattern is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a polling wait mechanism, relying on a user-defined callback 'looper' and a 'WaitContext'. It properly manages timing, conditions, and timeout handling. It does not access external data sources, invoke system commands, or perform any network operations. No anomalies or malicious patterns are evident. The design is typical for a wait utility function, and all components appear benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, well-structured wait utility without any signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It solely facilitates waiting on a condition via callbacks. No security issues or malicious intent detected.",
