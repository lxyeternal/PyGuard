{
  "purpose": "A polling utility function that repeatedly invokes a callback until a condition is met or a timeout occurs.",
  "sources": "The callback function 'looper' invoked repeatedly within the while loop; the WaitContext methods that manage timing and state.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of 'looper' callback; WaitContext methods that could potentially perform actions if misused, but are assumed safe.",
  "flows": "The function calls 'looper' with 'wctx' and additional arguments; depending on the result, it either completes or continues looping; on timeout, raises an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs detected. The use of sleep delays is standard; no external data leaks or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward polling utility that invokes a user-defined callback repeatedly until success or timeout, managing delays and timing via a context object. It employs standard Python modules and practices, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The callback 'looper' is external and trusted, and the code does not perform network, file, or environment variable operations. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly set to zero. The security risk score is minimal, reflecting the potential risk if the callback is malicious, but this is outside the code's scope. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe polling utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified, with negligible security risk. No modifications are necessary.",
