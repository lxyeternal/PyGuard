{
  "purpose": "A utility function to wait for a certain condition to be met by repeatedly calling a callback function within a timeout period.",
  "sources": "The function reads parameters and callback functions provided as arguments; it also accesses attributes of the WaitContext instance.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data, nor are there data leaks or system commands executed within this code.",
  "flows": "The callback 'looper' is repeatedly invoked with the context and arguments until it returns True or timeout occurs. No untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or malicious system commands are used. The code relies on imported modules and callbacks for its core logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a waiting mechanism with configurable delay, interval, and timeout. It uses a callback pattern, passing a WaitContext object and optional arguments to 'looper'. It handles timeouts and raises exceptions if the condition isn't met. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears to be a standard utility function for synchronization or polling, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard waiting utility function with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply orchestrates repeated polling with timeout handling. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
