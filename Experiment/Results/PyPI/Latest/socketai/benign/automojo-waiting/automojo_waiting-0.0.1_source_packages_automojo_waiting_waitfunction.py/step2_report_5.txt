  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a polling utility that invokes a callback until success or timeout.\n- It uses standard patterns: sleep, callback invocation, timeout handling.\n- No external data sources, network, or file operations are involved.\n- The code relies on trusted modules and classes (`WaitContext`, constants).\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The function raises a `TimeoutError` on failure, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate, describes a polling utility.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity or security risk identified.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0.0`, `securityRisk=0.0`, `obfuscated=0.0`, confidence=1.0\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct, straightforward.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Well-reasoned, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, confidence=1\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Properly identifies the utility nature, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0.1`, `obfuscated=0`, confidence=0.9\n\n**Note:** The security risk is set at 0.1, which is low but indicates minimal concern. Given the code's benign nature, this seems acceptable. No need to increase.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Appropriately identifies the code as a benign wait utility.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, confidence=1\n\n**Verdict:** No issues with scores.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly states that the code is a standard wait/retry utility.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0.1`, `obfuscated=0`, confidence=1\n\n**Note:** Similar to report 3, the security risk is minimal, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a benign, standard polling utility.\n- No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is justified.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal concern, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- Confidence levels are high, given the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed based on the current information.\n- The code does not exhibit any malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.0–0.1 (very low, just a polling utility)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, benign, and well-structured. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
