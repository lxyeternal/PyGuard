{
  "purpose": "This module defines constants related to timeout configurations and a class representing timeout states.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data are constants or class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only defines static constants and a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions and a class with fixed attributes for timeout states. It includes descriptive comments, author information, and static variables. There are no functions, no data handling, no dynamic execution, and no external inputs or outputs. The code appears standard and benign, serving as a configuration/constants module. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign constants module used for timeout handling. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are present.",
