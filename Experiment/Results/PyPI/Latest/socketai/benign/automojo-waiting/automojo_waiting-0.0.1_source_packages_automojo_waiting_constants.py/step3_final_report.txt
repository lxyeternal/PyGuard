{
  "purpose": "Defines timeout-related constants and a class representing timeout states for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Static constants and class definitions; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static definitions with no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with only constants and a simple class. The copyright year is in the future (2025), which is unusual but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module defining constants and a class with timeout states. It contains no functions, data processing, or dynamic behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are present. The code is well-commented and serves as configuration/constants. The future copyright year is likely a placeholder or typo but does not impact security. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static constants module with no malicious or obfuscated content. The assigned scores are justified and accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
