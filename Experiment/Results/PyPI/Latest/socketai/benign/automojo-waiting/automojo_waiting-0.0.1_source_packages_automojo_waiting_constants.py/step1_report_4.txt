{
  "purpose": "This module defines constants related to timeout configurations and states, likely used in other parts of a larger application.",
  "sources": "The constants are hardcoded within the module, specifically DEFAULT_WAIT_DELAY, DEFAULT_WAIT_INTERVAL, DEFAULT_WAIT_TIMEOUT, and MSG_TEMPL_TIME_COMPONENTS.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input sources or sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the constants are static values used internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs are present. The class TimeoutState simply defines integer status codes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static constant definitions and a class representing timeout states. It does not contain any input handling, dynamic execution, or data manipulation that could be malicious. The module appears to serve a straightforward purpose of defining constants for use elsewhere. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard constants module with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears safe and typical for configuration or constant definitions in a larger project.",
