  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the actual code.\n\n1. **Assessment of the Code Content:**\n   - The code is a straightforward constants module defining timeout-related constants and a class with static status codes.\n   - There are no functions, no data processing, no external input/output, and no dynamic behavior.\n   - The code includes descriptive comments, author info, and static variables, all of which are benign.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns.\n   - The copyright date is in the future (2025), which is unusual but not suspicious.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0.\n   - The confidence level is 1 in all reports, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Since the code is static, contains only constants and a simple class, there's no basis for malware or obfuscation.\n   - The future copyright date is odd but not malicious.\n   - No issues are present that would warrant raising risk scores.\n\n5. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The reports' assessments are consistent with the code content.\n   - No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThe code is a benign, standard constants module used for timeout handling. All indicators point to a safe, non-malicious component.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are needed. The code is entirely benign and safe for use in a larger project.",
