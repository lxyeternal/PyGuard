{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and a class related to timeout management, mainly for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static constants and a simple class with constant values representing timeout states. There are no functions, no dynamic code execution, and no data handling or external interactions. All elements serve configuration or status purposes, with no signs of malicious intent. The copyright date appears to be in the future but that is not inherently suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module defining constants and a class for timeout states. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks in this code segment.",
