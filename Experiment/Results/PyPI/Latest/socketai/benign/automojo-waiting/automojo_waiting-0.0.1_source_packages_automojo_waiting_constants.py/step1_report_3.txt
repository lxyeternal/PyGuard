  "purpose": "This module defines constants related to timeout configurations and states for use in other parts of a larger application.",
  "sources": "There are no explicit sources of input or external data reads in this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects, as the code only defines constants and a class with static attributes.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks because no input or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code structures, or hidden behaviors present in this code segment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions, a string template, and a simple class with static attributes. No input handling, data processing, or security-sensitive operations are performed. The code is straightforward and does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module defining constants for timeout management. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
