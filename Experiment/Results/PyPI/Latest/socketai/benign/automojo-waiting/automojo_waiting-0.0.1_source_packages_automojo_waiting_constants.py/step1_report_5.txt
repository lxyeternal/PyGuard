{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and a class related to timeout handling in a module, likely for timing operations.",
  "sources": "No input sources; constants and class definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing involving untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static constants and class definitions without dynamic execution or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions, a class with status codes, and a descriptive comment block. No input handling, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution are present. It appears to serve as a static configuration or constants module with no malicious indicators or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module defining constants and a status class for timeout operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
