  "purpose": "This module serves as an interface for the 'waiting' package, exporting constants and classes related to wait functionality.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; only imports from other modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily imports and re-exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes and constants from internal modules and exports them via __all__. It contains no data processing, no input/output operations, nor any dynamic execution or external network calls. The code appears to be standard package scaffolding, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning solely as a public interface for the 'waiting' package components. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
