{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an aggregator and exporter of public elements related to waiting mechanisms within the 'waiting' package, providing constants and class/function imports for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'automojo.waiting.constants', 'automojo.waiting.waitfunction', and 'automojo.waiting.waitmodel' modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "The code imports elements from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, with no processing or data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of documentation, author metadata, import statements, and defining the __all__ list for module exports. All imported elements are from internal, presumably trusted, modules. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are referenced. The structure is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a standard module initializer or facade pattern for the 'waiting' package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that re-exports constants and classes for external use, with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity. It appears safe and standard for Python package code.",
