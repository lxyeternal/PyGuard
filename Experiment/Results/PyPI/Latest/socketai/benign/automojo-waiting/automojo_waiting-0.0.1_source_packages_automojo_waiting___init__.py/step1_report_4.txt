{
  "purpose": "The module exports public elements related to a waiting mechanism, including constants and classes for handling timeouts and wait conditions.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load constants and functions from the 'automojo.waiting' package modules.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only imports and re-exports symbols, with no data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "Imported constants and functions are made available for external use; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The copyright date is in the future (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as a module initializer, importing specific elements from other modules and defining what is publicly accessible. No code execution, data handling, or external communications are present. It appears to be a straightforward package module setup without any malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module definition that exports specific classes and constants for waiting mechanisms. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this fragment.",
