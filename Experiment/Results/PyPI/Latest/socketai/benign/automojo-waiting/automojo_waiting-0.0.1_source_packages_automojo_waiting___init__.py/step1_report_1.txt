{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an aggregator and export point for the waiting package components, re-exporting constants, classes, and functions for external use.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; it only imports from other modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or handle inputs directly.",
  "flows": "N/A; there are no source-to-sink data flows since the code only imports and re-exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of documentation strings, author metadata, and import/export statements. It imports several constants, classes, and functions from internal modules and re-exports them. There are no user inputs, network communications, or data processing involved. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward module aggregator, with no security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that re-exports components from the waiting package. There is no malicious behavior, no data leakage, and no security concerns based on this code alone.",
