  "purpose": "This module serves as an interface that re-exports constants, classes, and functions from internal modules within the 'automojo.waiting' package, providing a clean public API.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external or untrusted input; it imports from internal modules only.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and re-exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the future copyright year '2025', which appears to be a typo or placeholder, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports constants, classes, and functions from internal modules and re-exports them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The code's purpose is purely organizational, serving as a facade or interface. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The only minor irregularity is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and very low security risk scores. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard module that re-exports package components with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible. The only minor note is the placeholder copyright year, which does not impact security.",
