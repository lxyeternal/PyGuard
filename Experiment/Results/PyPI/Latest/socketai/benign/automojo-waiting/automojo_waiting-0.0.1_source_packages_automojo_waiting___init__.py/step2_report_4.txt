  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a simple module that imports constants, classes, and functions from internal modules within the `automojo.waiting` package.\n   - It then re-exports these elements via the `__all__` list.\n   - The code contains metadata such as author, copyright, and docstrings.\n   - There are no user inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or data processing.\n   - The code is straightforward, serving as an aggregator or facade for the package components.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n   - The code's sole purpose is to re-export symbols, which is a common pattern in Python packages.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no security risks or malicious behavior.\n   - They mention the absence of suspicious patterns, data leaks, or external communications.\n   - Slight note on the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not suspicious.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and malware scores are 0 across all reports.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any suspicious activity, the risk score should be 0 or very close to it. Some reports assign 0.1, possibly due to the future date anomaly, but this is negligible.\n   \n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025). However, this is likely a typo or placeholder.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or exploits are justified based on this code snippet.\n\n6. **Overall Security Assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign module that simply re-exports components.\n   - No security risks, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n   - The scores should reflect this: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consistent findings across all reports and the code's straightforward nature.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe module with no malicious or suspicious elements. The current scoring is appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
