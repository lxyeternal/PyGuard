  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a module that imports constants, classes, and functions from internal modules within the 'automojo.waiting' package.\n   - It then re-exports these elements via the `__all__` list, serving as an aggregator or facade.\n   - There are no data processing, user inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The module contains only documentation strings, author metadata, and import/export statements.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code.\n   - The only unusual aspect is the copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future; this is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports concur that the code is benign, primarily serving as a package interface.\n   - They highlight the absence of data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1, some 0.9), indicating strong agreement on the benign nature.\n   - Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports.\n   - Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal concern.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the lack of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all cases; the code is straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, the risk score of 0 or 0.1 is justified; the slight increase for the future date is negligible and not indicative of risk.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - No issues are evident; the code is standard and secure.\n   - The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is not suspicious but might be a typo.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a simple, safe module that re-exports components from internal modules.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Keep at 0 or 0.1; the current scores are appropriate.\n- **Additional notes:** No changes needed; the reports are accurate.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments provided.**",
