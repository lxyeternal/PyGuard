{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an interface exporting elements of the 'waiting' package, including constants and classes related to wait functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'automojo.waiting' modules: constants, waitfunction, and waitmodel.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or vulnerable operations are performed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily re-exports of imported components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The __copyright__ year is in the future (2025), but that alone isn't suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific elements from the 'automojo.waiting' package and re-exports them. It contains standard metadata, author info, and licensing details. No user input, network calls, or data processing occurs within this snippet. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard module for re-exporting components of a package with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain any malicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
