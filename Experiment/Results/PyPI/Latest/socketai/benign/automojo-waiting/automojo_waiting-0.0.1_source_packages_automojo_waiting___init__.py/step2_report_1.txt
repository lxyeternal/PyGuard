  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a simple module that imports constants, classes, and functions from internal modules (`constants`, `waitfunction`, `waitmodel`) within the `automojo.waiting` package.\n   - It then re-exports these elements via the `__all__` list.\n   - The code contains only metadata, import statements, and the `__all__` declaration.\n   - There are no user inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or data processing.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The copyright year is in the future (2025), which might be a typo or placeholder, but not malicious.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Considerations:**\n   - The code is purely an export module, serving as an interface or facade.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n   - No untrusted data handling or external communication.\n   - The structure is straightforward and standard for Python packages.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n   - They note the absence of data flow from untrusted sources, no obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution.\n   - Some reports mention the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not an attack vector.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and malware scores are 0 across all reports.\n   - The security risk scores are minimal, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign analysis.\n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All are very low (0 or 0.1), justified by the absence of any suspicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025). This is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n   - No evidence of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n6. **Final Assessment:**\n   - Based on the code and reports, the supply chain security risk is negligible.\n   - No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n   - The code is a benign, standard module setup with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering the placeholder year, but that is negligible)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a safe, non-malicious module that simply re-exports package components. No security risks or malware are present based on the provided snippet and analysis.",
