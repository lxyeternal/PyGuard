{
  "purpose": "Defines a class 'MaleoSecurityClients' that holds references to HTTP and service client classes for security-related operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .http and .services",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data directly",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; class attributes are assigned class references only",
  "anomalies": "Nothing unusual; simple class attribute assignments referencing imported classes; no dynamic execution or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules and assigns their classes to class attributes within 'MaleoSecurityClients'. This pattern suggests encapsulation or convenience grouping. No input handling, data processing, or execution of untrusted code occurs here. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or secret leaks. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a larger project structure for security-related HTTP and service clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class definition that encapsulates references to other classes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be benign and serves as a container for client classes.",
