  "purpose": "Define a class that holds references to HTTP client and service classes for security purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.http and .services). No external data inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data processing, storage, or network operations occur.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares class attributes referencing imported classes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code appears straightforward and clean.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from local modules and assigns them as class attributes. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated elements, or suspicious patterns. The structure is simple and typical for organizing dependencies. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard organizational pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It merely references other classes for use elsewhere.",
