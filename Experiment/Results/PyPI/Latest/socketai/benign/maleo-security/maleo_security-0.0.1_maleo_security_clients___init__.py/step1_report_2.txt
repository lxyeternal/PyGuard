  "purpose": "Define a class to encapsulate HTTP client and service dependencies for Maleo Security module",
  "sources": "Import statements for __future__, http module, and services module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class attribute assignments are static references",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; standard class attribute assignment",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations, imports two classes from local modules, and defines a class with two class attributes assigned to these imported classes. There are no inputs, external data, or dynamic execution. The code appears to be a simple dependency container or namespace holder. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward dependency encapsulation class with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It appears to serve as a structural component within a larger codebase.",
