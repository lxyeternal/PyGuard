  "purpose": "Defines a class to group HTTP and service clients for security purposes within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules (.http and .services)",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or exposed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the class only assigns references to imported classes",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing classes and assigning them as class variables. No input/output operations, no data processing, and no external network interactions are present. It serves as a configuration or organizational structure for client classes. The imported modules may contain sensitive logic, but based solely on this snippet, there is no malicious behavior. The code is minimal and appears standard for a module organizing client classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a simple container for security-related client classes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident within this snippet.",
