  "purpose": "Organize references to imported security-related classes within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'MaleoSecurityHTTPClient' and 'MaleoSecurityClientServices'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "None; static class attribute assignments without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class with no dynamic behavior, input, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes and assigns them as class attributes, serving as a dependency container or organizational structure. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks. The code is static, with no external data handling or network operations. The security and malware scores are appropriately zero, reflecting the benign nature. The only minor inconsistency in prior reports was a high risk score (0.9) in one report, which is unjustified given the code's simplicity. The risk score should be adjusted downward to 0.1 or 0, aligning with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static dependency container with no security risks, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The only necessary adjustment is lowering the risk score in the previously higher-scoring report to accurately reflect its safety.",
