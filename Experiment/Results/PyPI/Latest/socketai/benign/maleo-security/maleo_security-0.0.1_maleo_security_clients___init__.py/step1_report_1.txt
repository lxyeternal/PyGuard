  "purpose": "Define a class to organize and access HTTP client and service classes related to Maleo Security.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.http and .services). No external input sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data output points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from sources to sinks; the code merely assigns imported classes to class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward class and attribute definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from local modules and assigns them to class attributes without any processing or dynamic behavior. No user input, environment variables, or data transmission occurs. No obfuscated or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple organizational structure for class access within a larger project. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
