  "purpose": "A service layer facilitating message signing and verification via external HTTP controllers, with validation and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for signing/verifying functions, and the controller type parameter.",
  "sinks": "Delegation to external HTTP controller methods for cryptographic operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation -> delegation to external controller -> response validation -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of controller type, delegates cryptographic signing and verification to external HTTP controllers, and handles responses with validation. It employs exception handling decorators for robustness. No embedded malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The reliance on external controllers is typical but could be a trust concern outside this scope. Overall, the code is a straightforward, well-structured API wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic service interface with proper validation and error handling, exhibiting no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk assuming external dependencies are trustworthy.",
