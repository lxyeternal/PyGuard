  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client for signing/verifying messages, with validation, exception handling, and delegation to HTTP controllers.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Validation is straightforward. The response handling is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (low). These are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; the code appears safe and standard.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on orchestrating calls to external controllers, proper validation, and error handling.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no data leaks, no malicious behavior. It relies on external modules presumed trustworthy.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a service layer for cryptographic operations, with validation and external calls.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or secret handling. The pattern is consistent with typical service wrappers.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern, focusing on HTTP delegation, validation, and error handling.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation. External controllers are a dependency but not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and standard.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Asynchronous service for signing/verifying, delegating to external controllers.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or secret handling. The external controllers are a potential risk if compromised, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports confirm the code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks beyond the low baseline.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified. The logic is consistent, validation is appropriate, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Scores consistency:** All malware scores are 0, which aligns with the reports. Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** 0.2 is low and appropriate, reflecting minimal inherent risk in this service layer assuming external controllers are trustworthy.\n- **Malware justification:** No evidence of malware or malicious intent. The code delegates cryptographic operations to external modules, which could be a risk if those modules are malicious, but within this code, no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Assumption-based vulnerabilities:** The reports correctly avoid assumptions about the security of external controllers; they only assess the code snippet itself.\n- **Score adjustments:** No changes needed; the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security risk score:** **0.2** (low, typical for a service delegating to external modules, assuming external trustworthiness)\n\n**In conclusion,** the code appears to be a well-structured, standard cryptographic signature service interface with no signs of malicious activity or security issues within the provided scope.",
