{
  "purpose": "This code provides an asynchronous service layer for signing and verifying single and multiple messages via different controller types, primarily HTTP, with error handling and response validation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for signing/verifying methods; use of external controller methods (sign_single, sign_multiple, verify_single, verify_multiple).",
  "sinks": "Return statements with model validation, external controller calls, error message returns, and exception handling decorators.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated for controller type → Calls to external HTTP controller methods → Responses are validated and returned or errors are generated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious pattern observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a service class with static methods for signing and verifying signatures, utilizing external controller calls. It performs input validation, error handling, and response validation. All data flows are contained within expected boundaries; no suspicious data leakage, dynamic execution, or malicious behavior is evident. The functions properly handle errors and only interact with external modules in a controlled manner, with no signs of secret exfiltration or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a signature service layer with proper validation and error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as intended for secure signature operations, with no suspicious activity detected.",
