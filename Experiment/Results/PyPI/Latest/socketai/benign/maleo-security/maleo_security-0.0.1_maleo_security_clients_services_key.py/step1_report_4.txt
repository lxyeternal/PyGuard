{
  "purpose": "The code provides an asynchronous service for creating RSA private keys, public keys, and key pairs via specified controllers, primarily HTTP-based.",
  "sources": "User input parameters: 'parameters' arguments for key creation; 'controller_type' argument for choosing the controller type.",
  "sinks": "Calls to external controller methods ('create_private', 'create_public', 'create_pair') which handle key generation; returns validated results.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then passed to external controller methods; results are validated and returned, forming a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code present. Exception handling is in place. Controller type validation appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation of input types and controller types, then delegates key creation to external controllers. It handles success and failure cases, returning appropriate results. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. All interactions with external controllers are standard function calls, and there are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden payloads. The use of exception handlers and validation suggests standard security practices. Overall, the code appears to be a standard service implementation for key generation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of an asynchronous key management service, with proper input validation and delegation to external controllers. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. It appears secure in the context of its described functionality.",
