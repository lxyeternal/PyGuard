{
  "purpose": "This code provides a service layer for creating RSA private, public, and key pair objects, primarily interacting with HTTP controllers to generate cryptographic keys.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to create_private, create_public, and create_pair methods; external controller responses.",
  "sinks": "Return statements, especially when handling controller results and validation; possible data handling points.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then passed to external controllers; controller responses are validated and returned as structured results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious network activity or system modifications evident.",
  "analysis": "The code validates controller type inputs, delegates key creation to external HTTP controllers, and processes their responses. It uses structured validation and exception handling via decorators. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection are present. The code appears to be a standard service wrapper for cryptographic key generation, relying on external, presumably secure, controllers. No obfuscation, malware signatures, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward service interface for key generation operations, with proper validation and exception handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and compliant with expected functionality.",
