{
  "purpose": "Provides an async service layer for creating RSA private keys, public keys, and key pairs, delegating cryptographic operations to external controllers with validation and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for key creation, controller type validation, external controller calls (create_private, create_public, create_pair).",
  "sinks": "Response handling from external controllers, validation failures, exception handling pathways.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation -> controller type check -> delegate to external controller -> handle success/failure -> return structured result.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. External controllers are assumed secure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured service wrapper for cryptographic key management. It performs necessary validation, delegates to external controllers, and handles responses appropriately. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior. External dependencies are the main consideration for security, but within this code, no issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is secure, clear, and free of malicious intent. It functions as a standard cryptographic key management service layer, with appropriate validation and error handling. The low risk score reflects minimal inherent vulnerabilities within this code snippet.",
