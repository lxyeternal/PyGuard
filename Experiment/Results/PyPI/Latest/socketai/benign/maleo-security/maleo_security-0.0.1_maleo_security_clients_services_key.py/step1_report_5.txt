{
  "purpose": "This source code defines a service class for creating RSA private keys, public keys, and key pairs, with support for different controller types, primarily HTTP, and handles exceptions and responses.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for create_private, create_public, and create_pair methods; usage of controller_type argument; calls to external controller methods for key creation.",
  "sinks": "Return statements with validation errors, external controller method calls for key creation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → validation of controller_type → controller method invocation based on type → processing of controller response → return of success or failure result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed. No signs of malicious data exfiltration, network activity, or system manipulation within this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation on input parameters and controller types, calls external controllers for cryptographic key creation, and handles responses accordingly. All operations seem to be standard for a cryptographic key management service. There are no indications of data leakage, secret theft, or malicious behavior. The only potential concern could be reliance on external controllers, but without their implementation, no malicious activity can be inferred from this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard service layer for key generation, with proper validation and error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling within this module. It maintains good practices for security and input validation.",
