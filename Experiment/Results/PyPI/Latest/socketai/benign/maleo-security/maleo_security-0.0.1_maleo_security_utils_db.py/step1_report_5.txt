  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only defines a class and imports modules, no data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for ORM setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a subclass of DatabaseManager, and sets up a declarative base for ORM models. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalous patterns. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ORM setup for a database management class without any suspicious or malicious intent. It appears safe based on the provided snippet.",
