  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM base class for database tables related to Maleo security features",
  "sources": "Import statements for sqlalchemy.orm, maleo_foundation.db.manager, and maleo_foundation.db.table",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations",
  "flows": "The class definition creates a declarative base linked to BaseTable, which is used for ORM mapping",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and typical for ORM setup; no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, then defines a class MaleoSecurityDatabaseManager inheriting from DatabaseManager. It creates a SQLAlchemy declarative base using 'declarative_base' with a custom base class 'BaseTable'. The metadata is extracted for further ORM operations. There are no input sources, untrusted data flows, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code appears to be a standard ORM setup for a database schema related to security management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard ORM base class definition with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a foundation for database table mappings in the context of Maleo security infrastructure.",
