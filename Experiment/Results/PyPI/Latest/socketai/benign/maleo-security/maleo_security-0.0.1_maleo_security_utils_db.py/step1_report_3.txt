  "purpose": "The code defines a subclass of DatabaseManager that uses SQLAlchemy's declarative base for database schema definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sqlalchemy.orm, maleo_foundation.db.manager, and maleo_foundation.db.table; class definition setting up Base and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; no untrusted data handling, external network connections, or file operations present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident; the code primarily sets up ORM mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed; the code is straightforward ORM setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary ORM and database management modules, then defines a class that sets up a declarative base for ORM mappings using SQLAlchemy. It leverages 'declarative_base' with a custom base class 'BaseTable', which is typical for ORM schema definitions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard setup code for SQLAlchemy ORM models, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
