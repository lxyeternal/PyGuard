  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy declarative base class for database table models related to Maleo Foundation security database management.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sqlalchemy.orm and maleo_foundation.db modules; class definition that inherits from DatabaseManager.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input or data. No code that executes untrusted code or transmits data externally.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The code solely defines a base class for ORM models.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for ORM and database management, then defines a subclass that creates a declarative base for ORM models. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or input handling. The class appears to serve as a foundational component for database model definitions, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and primarily serves as a base class definition for ORM models related to the database. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks within this code snippet.",
