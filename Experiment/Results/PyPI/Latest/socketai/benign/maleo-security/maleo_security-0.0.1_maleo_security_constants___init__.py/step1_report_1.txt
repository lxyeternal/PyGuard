  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, but no specific purpose is evident due to lack of context or comments.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; the code does not read external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations are identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. No obfuscation detected; code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimal and straightforward, with no indications of malicious activities. It neither reads nor writes external data, nor does it invoke suspicious system commands or network activities. The absence of comments or context makes it difficult to ascertain intent, but structurally it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is simple and lacks any suspicious or malicious elements.",
