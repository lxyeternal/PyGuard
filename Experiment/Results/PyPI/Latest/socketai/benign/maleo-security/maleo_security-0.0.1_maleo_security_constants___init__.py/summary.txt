  "conclusion": "The majority of reports correctly identify benign or insufficient data, while Report 3's behaviors warrant moderate suspicion. Slight adjustments to malware and obfuscation scores could better reflect the observed suspicious activities, but current scores are acceptable. The supply chain risk remains low overall, with moderate concern in one case."
