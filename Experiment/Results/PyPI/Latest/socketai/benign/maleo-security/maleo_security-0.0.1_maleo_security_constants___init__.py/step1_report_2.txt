{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for general execution, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; the code does not read user input, environment variables, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network communication, file writing, or system commands; however, the code does not perform such actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are detected, as the code does not handle untrusted data or external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no obfuscated elements, hardcoded secrets, or unusual language features. It contains standard import statements and function definitions, but no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of basic Python constructs: imports, variable assignments, and function definitions. No external data input, network activity, or sensitive operations are evident. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. The absence of complex logic or obfuscated code further reduces suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or malicious code inclusion. The code appears benign with no immediate security concerns.",
