{
  "purpose": "Defines a class that aggregates multiple security-related service classes for easier access.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .key, .hash, .encryption, .signature, .token",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; code only assigns imported classes to class variables",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources; no data processing occurs in this code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several security service classes and encapsulates them within a single class as class variables. There is no dynamic execution, no input reading, and no processing of untrusted data. The imports suggest these are predefined classes, presumably implemented elsewhere. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code appears to serve as a convenient interface or namespace for security services.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign wrapper class for importing and aggregating security service classes. There are no signs of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation.",
