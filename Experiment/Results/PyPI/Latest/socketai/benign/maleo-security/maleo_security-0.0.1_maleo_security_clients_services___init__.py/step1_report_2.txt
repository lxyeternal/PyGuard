{
  "purpose": "Defines a container class for various security-related client services by importing and assigning them as class attributes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.key, .hash, .encryption, .signature, .token). No external data sources or user input handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Imports lead to class attribute assignments; no data flow involving untrusted sources or sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code structure is straightforward, with no unusual patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific service classes and assigns them as static attributes of a container class. There is no data processing, no external data reading, and no actions performed beyond class attribute assignment. The import paths suggest a modular security package design. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The structure indicates a clean organizational pattern without obfuscation or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple container for importing and organizing security service classes. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, structural component of a larger security library.",
