{
  "purpose": "Define a container class for various security-related service classes related to cryptographic functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .key, .hash, .encryption, .signature, .token",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; class attributes are assigned class references without executing or processing untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; only static class assignments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code simply imports and assigns class references.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple security service classes and encapsulates them into a container class. There is no data processing, no untrusted input handling, and no dynamic execution. The code appears to be a straightforward module for organizing security services. It does not perform any network operations, file access, or secret handling within this snippet. All references are to other modules, which are not provided, but their mere import does not suggest malicious intent. The structure and syntax are standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple organizational structure for security service classes with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign module setting up class references for use elsewhere.",
