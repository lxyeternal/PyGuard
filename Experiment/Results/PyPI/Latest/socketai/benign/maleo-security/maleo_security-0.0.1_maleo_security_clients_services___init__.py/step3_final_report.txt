{
  "purpose": "Organizational container class that aggregates references to various security service classes for simplified access.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.key, .hash, .encryption, .signature, .token).",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "None; static references assigned without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and assignment, no suspicious patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple security-related classes and assigns them as class variables within a container class. It performs no data processing, input/output, or dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for dependency organization. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate it is benign and purely organizational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, organizational wrapper for security service classes with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
