{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class that aggregates various security service classes for easier access.",
  "sources": "Import statements for security service modules and class attribute assignments referencing those modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing involving untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data passing from source to sink is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules related to security functions (key, hash, encryption, signature, token) and creates a class that holds references to these service classes as class attributes. The structure suggests an organizational pattern for security services without executing or manipulating data. No input, output, or data handling that could be exploited is present. The code appears straightforward and follows standard Python module and class conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. It serves as a simple organizational wrapper for security service classes, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
