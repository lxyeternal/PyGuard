{
  "purpose": "Define a class aggregating security-related client service classes for easier access.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: key, hash, encryption, signature, token.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows or data manipulations observed; simply assigns class references.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, using class references without any dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific security service classes from local modules and assigns them as class attributes in a container class. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks. The structure appears standard for organizing dependencies. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or suspicious behaviors are detected. It appears to be a benign module for organizing security services.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard organizational structure without any signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply imports and assigns references to security service classes, which is typical in modular design.",
