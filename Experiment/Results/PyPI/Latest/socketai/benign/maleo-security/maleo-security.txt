      "obfuscated": 0.4,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits some suspicious features such as obfuscation and dynamic execution, which warrant cautious scoring. However, without concrete malicious payloads, the overall malicious intent remains uncertain. Slight increases in malware scores for reports with dynamic features are justified, and risk scores should reflect the potential for misuse. The current scores are mostly appropriate, with minor adjustments recommended for a more accurate risk assessment."

      "conclusion": "The majority of reports correctly identify benign or insufficient data, while Report 3's behaviors warrant moderate suspicion. Slight adjustments to malware and obfuscation scores could better reflect the observed suspicious activities, but current scores are acceptable. The supply chain risk remains low overall, with moderate concern in one case."

The security risk scores are slightly conservative; given the simplicity and standard pattern, they should be lowered to zero for a more accurate assessment."
