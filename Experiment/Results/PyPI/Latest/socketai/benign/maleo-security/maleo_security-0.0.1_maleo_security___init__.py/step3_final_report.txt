  "purpose": "Analysis of supply chain security and malicious behavior in the provided Python code.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, file/network operations, dynamic execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, system commands, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input or environment data -> dynamic execution or network/file operations -> potential data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, reading environment variables, network activity without clear purpose, obfuscated code, suspicious import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains dynamic execution and environment variable access, which are common vectors for malicious activity. Obfuscation is present in some reports, indicating potential concealment. No explicit malicious payloads like data exfiltration, reverse shells, or unauthorized network connections are confirmed. The suspicion levels vary, with some reports indicating high obfuscation and dynamic features but lacking concrete malicious indicators. The scores assigned generally reflect these observations, with slight adjustments recommended to better align with the suspicion levels, especially increasing malware scores in reports with dynamic execution and obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits some suspicious features such as obfuscation and dynamic execution, which warrant cautious scoring. However, without concrete malicious payloads, the overall malicious intent remains uncertain. Slight increases in malware scores for reports with dynamic features are justified, and risk scores should reflect the potential for misuse. The current scores are mostly appropriate, with minor adjustments recommended for a more accurate risk assessment.",
