  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a basic utility or module, but without specific context, it is unclear. It does not contain any explicit functionality that indicates malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not evident; the code does not read external input, environment variables, or user input explicitly.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks such as network connections, file writing, or command execution are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks are identifiable in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual programming constructs. The code structure is straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a simple, well-structured script or module. It contains no signs of data leakage, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. No network activity, credential handling, or data manipulation is present. Without external context or additional code, it does not exhibit malicious characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, this code shows no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is likely benign with respect to supply chain security and malware concerns.",
