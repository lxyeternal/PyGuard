  "purpose": "Defines token expiration durations for refresh and access tokens as static configuration constants.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static constant assignments within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of straightforward constant definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet assigns fixed integer values to two constants representing token durations. All reviews correctly identify the code as benign configuration, with no dynamic behavior, inputs, or malicious patterns. The scores assigned—confidence: 1, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0—are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No logical flaws or security concerns are present. The hardcoded durations are typical in configuration but do not pose security risks. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscation, and the lack of dynamic or external data flows confirms its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static configuration snippet setting token expiration durations. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
