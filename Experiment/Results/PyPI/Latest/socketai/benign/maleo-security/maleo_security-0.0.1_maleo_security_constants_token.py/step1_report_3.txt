  "purpose": "Define token expiration durations for refresh and access tokens",

  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data handling or output)",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurring",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns integer constants to variables representing token expiration durations. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations. The constants appear to be configuration parameters for token lifespan management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward configuration with no malicious intent or security issues. It is a benign snippet defining token durations.",
