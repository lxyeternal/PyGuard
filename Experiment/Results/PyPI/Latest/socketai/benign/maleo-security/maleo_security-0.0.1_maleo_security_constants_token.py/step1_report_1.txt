  "purpose": "Defines token duration constants for refresh and access tokens, likely used in authentication processes.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded integer values assigned to constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present.",
  "flows": "Constants are used as fixed values in token expiration logic, with no dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; simple constant assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two constant assignments for token expiration durations. There are no inputs, no processing, and no potential data leaks or malicious behavior. The code appears to be standard configuration or parameter definition for authentication token lifetimes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, straightforward, and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
