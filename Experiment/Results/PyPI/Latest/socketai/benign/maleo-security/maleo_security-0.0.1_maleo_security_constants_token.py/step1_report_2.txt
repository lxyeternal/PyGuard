  "purpose": "Define token expiration durations for refresh and access tokens in an authentication system.",
  "sources": "Constants are assigned fixed integer values indicating duration in days and minutes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; constants are static values.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; these are static configuration values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; only simple constant assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code sets two constants for token durations, using straightforward integer assignments without any dynamic execution or external input. No data leakage, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a standard configuration snippet for token expiration times.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration for token expiration durations. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
