  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of static constant assignments defining token durations.\n   - There are no inputs, no dynamic code, no data flows, and no suspicious patterns.\n   - The code appears to be standard configuration, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - All scores for malware and security risk are 0, indicating no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n   - The code is simple configuration, with no dynamic or suspicious elements.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0, not higher.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - Since no malicious behavior is observed or claimed, malware score should be 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated/malicious patterns.\n\n6. **Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n   - The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they recognize the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, static configuration defining token expiration durations.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate; no further action or concern is warranted.",
