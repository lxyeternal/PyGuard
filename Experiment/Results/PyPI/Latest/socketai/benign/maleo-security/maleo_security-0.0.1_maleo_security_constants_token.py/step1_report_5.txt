  "purpose": "Define token duration constants for authentication tokens.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded constants at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines constants, no data processing or external input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or processing is present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded duration values could be considered inflexible, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns fixed integer values to two constants related to token expiration durations. There is no input handling, no data processing, no external communication, and no dynamic or obfuscated code. These constants are typical in authentication schemes to specify token lifetimes. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and non-malicious; it defines constants for token durations without any suspicious or harmful logic.",
