  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Code Content Review:**\nThe code snippet in all reports is:\n```python\nREFRESH_TOKEN_DURATION_DAYS = 7\nACCESS_TOKEN_DURATION_MINUTES = 15\n```\nThis is a straightforward assignment of integer constants representing token expiration durations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports accurately describe the code as simple constant definitions for token durations, with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or suspicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Are there any errors or flaws?**  \n  **No.** The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, configuration-like, and free of malicious or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Security Risk:** All 0, justified as the code only defines constants without any security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes, they are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since all reports assign a risk of 0, and the code is purely configuration with no malicious behavior, this is appropriate.\n- No higher risk scores are warranted.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- **Malware score is 0** in all reports, which is correct.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- Some reports mention \"hardcoded constants\" as potentially inflexible. While true, this is standard practice for configuration and not malicious.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, straightforward, and standard configuration.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**In summary:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the code poses no security risks. The scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
