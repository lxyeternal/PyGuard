  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the underlying code:\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nREFRESH_TOKEN_DURATION_DAYS = 7\nACCESS_TOKEN_DURATION_MINUTES = 15\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code only assigns static integer constants for token durations.\n- No dynamic data, no external inputs, no code execution, no data leaks.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, straightforward configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the code as simple constant assignments for token durations.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior.\n- No data flows, inputs, or outputs involved.\n- All assign fixed values: 7 days for refresh tokens, 15 minutes for access tokens.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning in all reports is accurate.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign configuration.\n- The confidence levels (1) are appropriate.\n- Obfuscation and malware scores (0) are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- All reports assign malware score = 0, which is correct given no malicious activity.\n- Security risk score = 0, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated score = 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n### Any inconsistencies or unreasonable scores?\n- No. All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The only potential concern is the hardcoded nature of token durations, which could be inflexible, but this is a design choice rather than a security issue.\n- No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the code's scope.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate, and the code is benign.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**This aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's simplicity.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are correct in their benign assessment. The code is a standard configuration snippet with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
