  "purpose": "Define token expiration durations for refresh and access tokens in an authentication system",
  "sources": "Hardcoded constants for token durations",
  "sinks": "None; constants are used internally for token expiration settings",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and only sets constants",
  "analysis": "The code defines two constants for token expiration durations: one for refresh tokens (7 days) and one for access tokens (15 minutes). These are typical settings in authentication systems and do not involve any data input, external dependencies, or dynamic behavior. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The constants are clearly named, and there are no signs of hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration setting for token durations with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It is standard practice in authentication implementations.",
