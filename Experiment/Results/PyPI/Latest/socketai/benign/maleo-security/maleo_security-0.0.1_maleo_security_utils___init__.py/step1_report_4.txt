  "purpose": "Utility class for security-related functions, likely involving logging.",
  "sources": "Import statement from __future__ and local module .logger",
  "sinks": "Assignment to class variable Logger",
  "flows": "Import from __future__ -> import of logger module -> assignment to class variable",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import, but no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; minimal code complexity",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations from __future__ for compatibility, then imports a logger manager class from a relative module. It defines a utility class with a class attribute assigned to the logger manager. No data is read from untrusted sources, and no data is written or transmitted. The code appears to be a straightforward setup for logging functionalities, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility class setup with no malicious intent, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behavior. It functions to manage logging but does not perform any security-sensitive operations or data handling.",
