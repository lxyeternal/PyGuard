{
  "purpose": "A minimal utility class that assigns a logger manager to a class attribute, used for logging purposes within a package.",
  "sources": "Import of __future__.annotations and relative import of MaleoSecurityLoggerManager from .logger",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed or output",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data sources; the code only assigns a class attribute",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and class attribute assignment, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations support and a logger manager, then defines a class with a class attribute referencing that logger. It contains no functions, data processing, or dynamic behavior. The import patterns are standard, and there are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is a simple utility setup typical in package modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero. The security risk scores are slightly conservative; given the simplicity and standard pattern, they should be lowered to zero for a more accurate assessment.",
