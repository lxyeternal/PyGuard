  "purpose": "Utility class for security-related functions, utilizing a logger manager.",
  "sources": "Import statement from __future__ and local logger module import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform risky actions.",
  "flows": "The code defines a class with a logger attribute, but no data flow or input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; uses relative import which could be suspicious in some contexts but is common in packages. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__ for compatibility, then imports a logger manager class. Defines a utility class with a class attribute for logging. No input/output operations, no data flows, no suspicious code or obfuscation. No indications of malicious intent or security risks. The minimal structure suggests a standard utility class pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward utility class setup for security logging purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks present in this fragment.",
