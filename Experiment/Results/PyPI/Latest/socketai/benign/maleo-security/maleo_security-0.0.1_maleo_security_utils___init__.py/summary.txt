  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero. The security risk scores are slightly conservative; given the simplicity and standard pattern, they should be lowered to zero for a more accurate assessment."
