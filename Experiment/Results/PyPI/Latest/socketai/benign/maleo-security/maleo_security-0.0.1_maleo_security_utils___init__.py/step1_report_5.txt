  "purpose": "Utility class for security-related functions, initializing a logger manager",
  "sources": "Import statement and class attribute assignment",
  "sinks": "None present in the provided code",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks within this code fragment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports the future feature annotations for type hinting, and imports a logger manager class from a sibling module. It defines a utility class that assigns this logger to a class variable. There are no user inputs, no untrusted data handling, and no execution of dynamic or malicious code. The code appears standard and intended for logging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility class setup with standard import and attribute assignment, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
