  "purpose": "Utility class for security functions, involving logging management",
  "sources": "Import statements and class attribute assignment",
  "sinks": "None present in the provided code",
  "flows": "None identified due to limited code scope",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; import statement uses relative import which is standard in packages",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature for annotations and a relative import of a logger manager class. It defines a utility class with a class attribute set to the imported logger manager. There are no functions, no data input/output, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to be part of a larger project, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility class setup with a logger reference. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
