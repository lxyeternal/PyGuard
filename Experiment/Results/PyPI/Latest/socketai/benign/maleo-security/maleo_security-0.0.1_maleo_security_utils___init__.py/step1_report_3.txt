  "purpose": "Defines a utility class that initializes a logger manager for security-related functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statement for __future__ annotations, import of MaleoSecurityLoggerManager from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points identified in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __future__ import is standard; the class assigns a logger manager to a class variable. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations support, likely for type hints, and assigns a logger manager class to a class variable. This is typical for setting up a utility class. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected, and the code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility class setup with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be part of a larger security framework without any malicious or suspicious behavior in this fragment.",
