{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package, likely related to testing route availability, as indicated by the imported module 'test_route_availability'.",
  "sources": "The code imports a module from the same package, which may contain data or functions, but does not read external input directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal and does not contain any unusual or suspicious constructs; it only contains a license comment and a module import.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment and a single import statement. There are no apparent malicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The import is from a local module, which is common in package structures. No obfuscated code or malicious logic is present. Given the simplicity, it appears to be standard package code.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple module import with a license declaration and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical for a Python package's module file.",
