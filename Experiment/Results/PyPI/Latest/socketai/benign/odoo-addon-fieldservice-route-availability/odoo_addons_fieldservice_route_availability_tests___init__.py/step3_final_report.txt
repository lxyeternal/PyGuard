  "purpose": "Minimal import statement with license comment, typical for a package module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module (. import test_route_availability).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is static import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with only a license comment and import.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a license comment and a local module import, with no data processing, external input/output, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and standard structure support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module import with a license comment, showing no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
