{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'test_route_availability' from the current package, likely for testing or validation purposes.",
  "sources": "The only source is the import statement which loads a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external data flows are observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows are apparent; the code simply imports a module without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only a license comment and an import statement, with no suspicious or unusual activity. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a license declaration followed by a single import statement. There are no dynamic code executions, external network calls, or data manipulation. The import is from a relative module, which is common in package code. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing a standard import with a license comment. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
