  "purpose": "Importing a module named 'test_route_availability' from the current package, likely for testing or route validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted data sources",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present in this minimal code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Lack of actual code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or suspicious code. The import appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license declaration and an import statement. The import is a local module import with no external network activity or data handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. There are no data sources or sinks, and the code structure is straightforward. Given its simplicity, the code appears benign and typical of a package setup or test initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign import statement following a license declaration, with no signs of malware or security concerns.",
