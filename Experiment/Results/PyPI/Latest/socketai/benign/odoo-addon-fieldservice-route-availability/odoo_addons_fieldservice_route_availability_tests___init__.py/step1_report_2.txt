{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named test_route_availability, likely for testing or validation purposes within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local package/module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present in the code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a license comment (AGPL-3.0), but no suspicious or unusual code activities",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment and a single import statement. The import is from a local module, which is standard practice. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, obfuscated code, or other suspicious activities. The license comment indicates open-source licensing but does not influence security directly.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a minimal code snippet focused on importing a module, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
