{
  "purpose": "This code enforces constraints on FSM routes in an Odoo module, specifically preventing scheduling on blackout days.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'fsm_route_id', 'scheduled_date_start', and related blackout day records within 'fsm_blackout_day_ids'.",
  "sinks": "Raises ValidationError if a blackout day is detected, which prevents saving invalid data.",
  "flows": "Inputs: order.fsm_route_id and order.scheduled_date_start -> Filtering blackout days -> Raising ValidationError upon match.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs data validation only.",
  "analysis": "The code is part of an Odoo model extension, implementing a constraint check to prevent scheduling on blackout days. It filters blackout days for a route and raises an error if the scheduled date matches any blackout day. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities. Usage of filtering and string formatting appears standard for Odoo, with no obfuscated or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate validation routine for route blackout days in an Odoo module. It does not contain malicious intent, malware, or security risks based on the provided content.",
