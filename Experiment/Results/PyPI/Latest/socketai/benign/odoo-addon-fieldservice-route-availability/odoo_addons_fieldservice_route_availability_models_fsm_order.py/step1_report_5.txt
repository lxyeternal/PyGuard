  "purpose": "Enforce blackout days on field service operation scheduling within an Odoo module.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'fsm_route_id', 'scheduled_date_start', and related 'fsm_blackout_group_ids' and 'fsm_blackout_day_ids'.",
  "sinks": "Raises ValidationError if the scheduled date matches blackout days, preventing invalid scheduling.",
  "flows": "Reads 'fsm_route_id' and 'scheduled_date_start' from the model, filters blackout days, and raises an exception if a match is found.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code performs standard validation with date filtering.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a constraint method to check if scheduled dates fall on blackout days for a route. It filters blackout days based on the date and raises a validation error to prevent scheduling on such days. The filtering logic is straightforward, using standard Odoo ORM methods. No suspicious data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The purpose appears to be legitimate validation within an Odoo business application.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical validation for blackout days in an Odoo module. There is no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The logic is clear, standard, and aligned with expected business validation functions.",
