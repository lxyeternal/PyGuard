{
  "purpose": "Enforces a constraint on 'fsm.order' to prevent scheduling on blackout days for specific routes.",
  "sources": "Reads 'fsm_route_id', 'scheduled_date_start', and related blackout day records ('fsm_blackout_group_ids', 'fsm_blackout_day_ids').",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; primarily raises ValidationError locally within the system.",
  "flows": "Reads route and date fields, filters blackout days matching the scheduled date, and raises an exception if a match is found.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of ORM filtering, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard validation check in Odoo, filtering blackout days for the route and comparing with the scheduled date. It raises an error if a blackout day is detected. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is clear, well-structured, and typical for business rule enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate business logic enforcing blackout day constraints. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
