{
  "purpose": "The code enforces a constraint on 'fsm.order' to prevent scheduling on blackout days for specific routes.",
  "sources": "Reads 'fsm_route_id', 'scheduled_date_start', and related 'fsm_blackout_group_ids' and 'fsm_blackout_day_ids'.",
  "sinks": "Raises a ValidationError if a blackout day is detected, which could halt or prevent certain operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'fsm_route_id' and 'scheduled_date_start' are checked; if matched with blackout days, a validation error is raised to block the operation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Odoo model constraints.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Odoo ORM features to enforce business logic constraints. It performs a filtered check on related blackout days and raises an exception if the scheduled date coincides with a blackout day. No external data is fetched or transmitted, and no suspicious activity or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard business logic constraint enforcement for scheduling, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code behavior.",
