{
  "purpose": "Extend the 'fsm.order' model in Odoo to enforce blackout day constraints on scheduled dates for field service management routes.",
  "sources": "Reads 'fsm_route_id', 'scheduled_date_start', and related blackout day data from the database.",
  "sinks": "Raises ValidationError if a blackout day matches the scheduled date, which affects the workflow within the application.",
  "flows": "Checks if 'fsm_route_id' and 'scheduled_date_start' are set, filters blackout days for that route and date, then raises an exception if a match is found.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated elements present. Use of standard Odoo ORM filtering and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a constraint that validates whether the scheduled date for an FSM order falls on a blackout day for the route. It uses standard ORM filtering with a lambda to find matching blackout days and raises a ValidationError if a match exists. The code operates within the expected framework of Odoo and performs data validation without executing any external or unsafe code. No hidden or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate validation logic within the Odoo framework. It checks for blackout days and prevents scheduling conflicts, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
