{
  "purpose": "The code adds a validation constraint to check for blackout days on a scheduled date in the context of field service management routes.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'order.fsm_route_id', 'order.scheduled_date_start', 'group.fsm_blackout_day_ids', and filters dates for validation.",
  "sinks": "Raises a ValidationError if the date matches a blackout day, which prevents saving invalid data.",
  "flows": "Accesses 'fsm_route_id' and 'scheduled_date_start' from the order; filters 'fsm_blackout_day_ids' for matching dates; raises error if match found.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code detected. No malicious behavior or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard validation implementation within Odoo's framework. It reads route and date data, checks against blackout dates, and raises an error if necessary. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. Usage of filtering and string formatting is straightforward and typical for validation logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate validation check to prevent scheduling on blackout days. No malicious intent or suspicious activity is evident.",
