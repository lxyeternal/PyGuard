  "purpose": "Static metadata declaration for an Odoo module, containing module information such as name, version, dependencies, and license.",
  "sources": "The manifest file itself, which provides static data about the module; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code does not process external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the file is purely declarative with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which appears to be a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static JSON-like manifest describing an Odoo module. It contains no executable code, dynamic data handling, or suspicious patterns. The only unusual aspect is the future year, which does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal, around 0.1, due to the date anomaly. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No malicious or obfuscated content is present, and the minor anomaly does not warrant a higher risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static metadata with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor future date is likely a placeholder and does not pose a security threat. Scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.1 to account for the anomaly, or 0 if considering it negligible.",
