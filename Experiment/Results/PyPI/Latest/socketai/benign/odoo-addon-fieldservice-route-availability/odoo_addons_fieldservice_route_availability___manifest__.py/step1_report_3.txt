  "purpose": "Metadata and configuration information for a Python package related to field service routing restrictions.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present in this static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only package metadata; no executable code or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a JSON-like dictionary defining package metadata such as name, version, license, dependencies, and maintainers. It does not include any executable code, input/output operations, or data handling routines. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or malicious behavior are evident. The structure appears to be a typical manifest for a Python package, possibly an Odoo module, with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious actions, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard package metadata declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate package descriptor for an open-source project.",
