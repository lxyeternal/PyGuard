  "purpose": "This code defines a package metadata for an Odoo module related to field service route availability restrictions.",
  "sources": "Metadata fields such as name, summary, version, category, website, author, maintainers, license, depends, and data; no user input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points that could lead to data leakage or execution of untrusted code are present in this metadata.",
  "flows": "There are no data or control flows; this is purely declarative metadata without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date, possibly indicating a placeholder or typo; no malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a package manifest for an Odoo module, including license info, metadata, dependencies, and data references. It does not contain executable code, user input, or external data handling. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright date, which may be an oversight or placeholder. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module manifest with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code detected. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is unlikely to pose security concerns.",
