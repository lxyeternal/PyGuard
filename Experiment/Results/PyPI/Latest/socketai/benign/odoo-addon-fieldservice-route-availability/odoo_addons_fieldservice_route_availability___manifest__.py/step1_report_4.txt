  "purpose": "Define metadata for the Odoo module 'Field Service Route Availability', including description, version, dependencies, and licensing information.",
  "sources": "Commented license and author information, JSON dictionary with module details",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing or external input/output operations",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Presence of license and metadata comments; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a JSON-like dictionary defining the module's metadata, including name, description, version, dependencies, and licensing. It is formatted as a Python comment and data structure for Odoo. No code execution, input handling, or external communication logic is present. The license and author comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious functions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely metadata describing an Odoo module. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be standard module declaration code with no anomalies.",
