  "purpose": "Extend the 'fsm.route' model in Odoo by adding a many-to-many field to associate blackout groups.",
  "sources": "Import statements; class definition; field declaration",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code mainly defines data structure",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward model extension with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Odoo modules and defines a model extension that adds a Many2many relationship field. The purpose appears to be structural, extending existing functionality to associate blackout groups with routes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is typical for Odoo module development, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard model extension for Odoo with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It only adds a relational field to enhance existing functionality.",
