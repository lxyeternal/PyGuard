  "purpose": "Extend the 'fsm.route' model by adding a Many2many relationship to 'fsm.blackout.group' for managing blackout days.",
  "sources": "The class definition and the Many2many field declaration.",
  "sinks": "Database interactions related to the 'fsm.route' model and its relation to 'fsm.blackout.group'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the model definition to the database, establishing the relation; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard import, class inheritance, and field declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard extension of an Odoo model, adding a relational field with explicit relation table and columns. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The import statements and class structure follow typical Odoo conventions. There are no signs of external network calls, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The code's purpose is purely structural, and it does not process untrusted input. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0-0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard model extension with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's straightforward structure. No adjustments are necessary.",
