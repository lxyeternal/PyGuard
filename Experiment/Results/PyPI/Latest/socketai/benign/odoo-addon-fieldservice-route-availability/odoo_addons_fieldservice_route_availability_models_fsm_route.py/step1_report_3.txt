{
  "purpose": "Extend the existing FSM route model to include blackout group associations",
  "sources": "import statement for 'fields' and 'models' from 'odoo'",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; primarily defines a data model extension",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward model extension with standard field declaration",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from Odoo, defines a class inheriting from an existing model, and adds a Many2many field linking to blackout groups. There are no hardcoded credentials, external network calls, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The structure adheres to standard Odoo module development practices. No signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Odoo model extension with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply adds a Many2many relationship to manage blackout days for FSM routes, with no suspicious or malicious code elements.",
