{
  "purpose": "Extend the existing 'fsm.route' model in Odoo by adding a Many2many field for blackout groups.",
  "sources": "Imports from odoo (fields, models); class definition and field declaration",
  "sinks": "Field definitions potentially store or manipulate data related to blackout groups",
  "flows": "Import statements → Class declaration → Field definition",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; only standard Odoo model extension with no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, or external network access",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Odoo modules, defines a new class inheriting from 'fsm.route', and adds a Many2many field linking to 'fsm.blackout.group'. The field appears to be a standard relational link without any malicious behavior. No obfuscation, hidden code, or external data flows are present. The comments are legal/license notices and do not affect execution security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward extension of an Odoo model to include blackout group associations. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
