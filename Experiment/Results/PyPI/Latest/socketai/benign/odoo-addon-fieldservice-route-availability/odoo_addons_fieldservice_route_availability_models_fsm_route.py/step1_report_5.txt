{
  "purpose": "Extend the FSMRoute model by adding a many-to-many relationship with blackout groups.",
  "sources": "Importing fields and models from odoo, accessing the FSMRoute model, defining a new field for blackout groups.",
  "sinks": "The new field 'fsm_blackout_group_ids' potentially receives data from user input, but as a relational field, it primarily reads from and writes to the database.",
  "flows": "User or system input to the 'fsm_blackout_group_ids' field, which stores related blackout group IDs, then interacts with the database for retrieval or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code is straightforward model extension with no unusual language features or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from Odoo, defines a model extension for 'fsm.route', and adds a Many2many field linking to 'fsm.blackout.group'. This setup is typical for Odoo module development, involving standard model inheritance and field definition. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns. The only potential concern is if the related 'fsm.blackout.group' model or the usage of this field involves insecure data handling, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Odoo module extension adding a relationship field. There is no malicious intent, suspicious code, or security risks present within this fragment.",
