{
  "purpose": "Extend the existing FSM route model by adding a many-to-many relationship with blackout groups.",
  "sources": "Import statements; field definition for 'fsm_blackout_group_ids'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the database where the many-to-many relation is stored.",
  "flows": "The field 'fsm_blackout_group_ids' can store multiple related blackout group IDs, but no data flows or untrusted input sources are explicitly present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward model extension.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from Odoo, defines a model extension inheriting from 'fsm.route', and adds a many-to-many field. The field relates to 'fsm.blackout.group' and uses specific relation table and column names. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The license comment indicates open-source licensing. No code injection, external data handling, or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple extension of an Odoo model adding a relational field without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears to be standard application code for model extension within Odoo framework.",
