{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal module that includes a license declaration and imports a local 'models' module, typical in Python package structures.",
  "sources": "The code reads the license comment and the import statement from the local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not process input or output.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to the import of the local 'models' module; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward with a license comment and a simple import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a license comment and an import statement. No data processing, external interactions, or suspicious patterns are evident. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, and high confidence. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The import of a local module 'models' is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. The code's simplicity and lack of external data flows support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and justified. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
