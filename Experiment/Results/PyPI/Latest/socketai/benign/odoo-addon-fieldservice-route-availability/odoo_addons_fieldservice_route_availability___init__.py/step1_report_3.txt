{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set the license for a Python package and imports a module named 'models'.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the import statement importing the 'models' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code, as no untrusted data processing or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as the code only contains a license comment and an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, containing only a license comment and an import; no anomalies or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a license comment indicating AGPL-3.0 or later, which is standard licensing information. It then imports a local module 'models'. There are no functions, data handling, or network operations. The import suggests the package relies on internal models, which is common in Python projects. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward Python module with licensing info and a simple import. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
