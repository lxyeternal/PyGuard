{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'models', likely for defining data structures or database models.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'models' module when imported.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads the 'models' module; no data flow analysis possible with this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; the only notable feature is the license comment. No anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment and an import statement for a local module 'models'. There are no functions, data processing, or external data inputs. No suspicious or malicious behavior can be inferred from this fragment. The import appears standard for a Python package or module. The license comment indicates open-source licensing but does not influence security analysis directly.",
  "conclusion": "This is a very minimal code snippet with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports a local module and states licensing information. No anomalies, malware, or security threats detected.",
