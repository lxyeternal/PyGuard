{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'models' module from the current package, likely for defining or accessing data models within the package.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the import statement, which loads a local module; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or data processing pathways; the code solely contains an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated code are present. The license comment is standard and does not influence code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment and an import statement from a local module. It does not execute any logic, handle inputs, or produce outputs. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The import indicates the package depends on 'models', but does not suggest any malicious activity by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving only to include a local models module. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
