{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package module, importing submodules 'fsm_route' and 'fsm_order' for further functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data directly; it only imports local submodules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this snippet; it simply imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements and a license comment, with no suspicious or unusual code patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is minimal, containing a license declaration and two import statements. It does not process or handle data directly. The imported modules are referenced relatively, which is typical for package internal structure. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. No external data sources or sinks are evident, and no suspicious code logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import structure with a license comment. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks in this fragment. It appears to be a benign part of a larger codebase.",
