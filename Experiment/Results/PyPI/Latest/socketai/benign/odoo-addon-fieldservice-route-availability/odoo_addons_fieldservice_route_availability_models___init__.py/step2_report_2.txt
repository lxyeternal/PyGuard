  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Context**:\n   - The code consists solely of a license comment and two import statements:\n     ```python\n     from . import fsm_route\n     from . import fsm_order\n     ```\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external inputs, or outputs.\n   - The imports are relative, indicating internal modules within a package.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - **Confirmed**: The code does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - **No anomalies**: No hardcoded secrets, data flows, or external data handling.\n   - **No malware**: The code is benign, simply importing modules.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as a benign, standard module import with no security concerns.\n   - They assign high confidence (mostly 1) that there are no issues.\n   - The malware scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Some reports assign very low security risk (0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the minimal code.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content.\n   - Since there's no evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security risk, the scores of 0 or near-zero are justified.\n   - The \"obfuscated\" score is 0 across reports, which is correct.\n   - The \"malware\" score is 0, matching the analysis.\n   - The \"securityRisk\" scores are also appropriately low.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - No discrepancies are evident.\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent.\n\n6. **My own assessment**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n   - **Risk score**: 0.0 to 0.1 (negligible, as there's no security concern)\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The code is a straightforward module import with an open-source license comment.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Keep the overall security risk very low, around 0.0–0.1.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are accurate.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.0–0.1\n\nThis is a benign, standard code snippet with no security concerns.",
