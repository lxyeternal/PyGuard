{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that imports modules related to 'fsm_route' and 'fsm_order'. Its purpose seems to be to include or load these modules as part of a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "The import statements are sources where the code reads or loads other modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this snippet. No untrusted data handling, network communication, or file writing occurs.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing internal modules ('fsm_route' and 'fsm_order'), with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a license declaration and two import statements for internal modules. It is a typical package structure, with no signs of malicious intent. No external input handling or data processing is visible. The import statements do not involve dynamic execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module import statement with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign part of a larger package.",
