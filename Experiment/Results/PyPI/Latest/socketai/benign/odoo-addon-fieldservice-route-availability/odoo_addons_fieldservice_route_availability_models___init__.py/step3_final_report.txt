{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal module import, likely part of a larger package, with a license comment indicating open-source licensing.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the license comment (for licensing info), and imports internal modules 'fsm_route' and 'fsm_order' via relative imports.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; the code only imports modules internally.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves reading the license comment and executing the import statements; no data flows from external sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a license comment and two relative import statements, indicating internal module dependencies. There are no functions, data processing, external inputs, or outputs. The absence of data flows, network activity, or malicious code suggests a benign purpose. The minimal structure and standard syntax imply no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the code's content. No anomalies or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module import with an open-source license comment. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
