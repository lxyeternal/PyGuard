  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is minimal, consisting solely of a license comment and two import statements:\n     ```python\n     from . import fsm_route\n     from . import fsm_order\n     ```\n   - There are no functions, data processing, or external inputs/outputs.\n   - The import statements are relative, indicating internal modules within a package.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Concerns:**\n   - No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.\n   - The code does not perform any network communication, file operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The license comment is standard and does not influence security.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Malware and Risk Scores:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the minimal and straightforward nature of the code.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Logical Errors:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reports.\n   - The reports correctly identify that this code is benign and part of a larger system.\n\n5. **Score Justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely import statements with no malicious activity, the malware score remains at 0.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - The overall security risk score should remain very low, consistent with the reports.\n\n6. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - All reports are consistent with the code's content.\n   - No report suggests any suspicious activity that warrants a higher risk or malware score.\n\n**Summary and Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet. Given the minimal and benign nature of this code, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
