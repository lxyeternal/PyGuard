  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to FSM routing and order processing, likely part of a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing internal modules: fsm_route and fsm_order.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible due to absence of data handling; the code only imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements and a license comment. There are no functions, data handling, or logic that could present security risks or malicious behavior. The license comment indicates open-source licensing with no malicious intent. The minimal nature of this code makes it unlikely to contain malicious behavior or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module import with a license comment, with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger project.",
