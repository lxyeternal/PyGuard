  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal import statement with a license comment.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or data handling.\n   - The code snippet is straightforward and typical for a Python module setup.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign and does not pose security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or errors are evident in these evaluations.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence) — appropriate given the simplicity.\n     - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n     - Malware: 0 — consistent with the code's benign nature.\n     - SecurityRisk: 0 — justified since there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - These scores are reasonable and align with the code's minimal and benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.0, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign malware score 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious logic, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to observable facts.\n   - They correctly interpret the import statement as harmless.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the minimal and benign nature of this code, the overall security posture is very low risk.\n- The license comment does not influence security but indicates licensing terms.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and thorough. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or vulnerable features.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the assessments provided and the actual code content.",
