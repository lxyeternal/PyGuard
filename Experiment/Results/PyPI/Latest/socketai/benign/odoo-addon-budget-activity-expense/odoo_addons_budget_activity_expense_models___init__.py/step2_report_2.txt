  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a minimal import statement (`from . import hr_expense`) accompanied by a license comment.\n   - No data processing, input/output, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - The code is standard for a Python module, typical in open source projects.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No report indicates any suspicious or malicious activity.\n   - The import statement is straightforward, importing a local module, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden code.\n   - The license comment is standard and does not influence security.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - The reports do not identify any errors or flaws.\n   - The code is minimal and correctly structured.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis: the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n5. **Potential for Underlying Risks**:\n   - Given the simplicity, there's no basis for higher malware or security risk scores.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or malicious.\n\n**Final Assessment & Recommendations**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: Should remain at **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: Should remain at **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: Should be **0** — no security vulnerabilities or risks are evident.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code snippet is a standard, benign module import with an associated license comment. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The existing scores are appropriate and should not be changed.\n\n**Note**: Always ensure that the imported module (`hr_expense`) itself is secure, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe.",
