  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal import statement with a license comment.\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data handling.\n   - The code is benign and typical for a Python module.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of suspicious patterns, data flows, or anomalies.\n   - No logical errors or overestimations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a security risk of 0, and the code is just a straightforward import statement with a license comment, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic, network, or data processing that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign malware score 0, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code's simplicity.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The assessments are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThis code snippet is entirely benign, with no security concerns. The import statement and license comment do not pose any risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's straightforward nature.",
