{
  "purpose": "This code imports a local module 'hr_expense' and includes a license comment, serving as part of a larger Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from . import hr_expense' reads the local module; the license comment is a static string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or output; the code simply imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement and a license comment. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic execution. The import is local and standard, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The license comment is benign and does not influence security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning confidence scores of 1, and malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and accurate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
