  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe minimal code: a license comment and a simple import statement.\n- No data flows, external communications, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The code snippets are consistent with typical package/module files in Python.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risks of 0, which seem appropriate given the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code snippets are straightforward and contain only a license comment and an import statement, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the minimal, benign nature of the code. They do not overstate risks or assume malicious intent where none exists.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code's clarity. Security risk scores are 0, appropriate for such minimal, benign code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **confidence scores** are mostly 1, indicating high certainty of benign nature, which is appropriate.\n- The one report with confidence 0.9 still aligns with the benign assessment.\n- The code does not contain any signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct; no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct; code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct; no security issues)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- Since the code is purely a license comment and an import statement, there is no reason to assign any higher scores.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reported scores and conclusions. The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code content.",
