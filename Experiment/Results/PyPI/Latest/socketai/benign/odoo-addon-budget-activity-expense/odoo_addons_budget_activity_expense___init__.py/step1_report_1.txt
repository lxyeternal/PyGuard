  "purpose": "This code appears to specify licensing information and imports a module named 'models'.",
  "sources": "The only source is the import statement 'from . import models'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data outputs or untrusted data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, with only a license comment and a single import statement; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a license declaration indicating AGPL-3.0 licensing, which is standard. It imports a local module 'models' using relative import syntax. There are no functions, data processing, or external network interactions. The code appears to be a typical module import statement with licensing info, lacking any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, primarily serving to declare licensing and import a local module. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues.",
