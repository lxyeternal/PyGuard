  "purpose": "License comment and import statement for a local module",
  "sources": "The license comment and the 'from . import models' statement",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present",
  "flows": "N/A, minimal code with no data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code constructs",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a license comment and a single import statement, which is typical for a module initialization file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, data leaks, or external network activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code. Confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module file with no malicious or security issues. The reports accurately reflect this, and the scores are consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
