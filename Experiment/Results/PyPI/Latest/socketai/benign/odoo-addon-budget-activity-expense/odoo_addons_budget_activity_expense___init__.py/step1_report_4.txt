{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'models' within the same package, likely for use elsewhere in the application.",
  "sources": "The import statement from . import models, which loads a local module or package named 'models'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or external network communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a license declaration and a single import statement, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code starts with a license comment indicating AGPL-3.0 licensing, then performs a straightforward relative import of a local module 'models'. There are no functions, data processing, external communications, or embedded logic. The import statement appears standard and typical for a Python package. The overall code is minimal and lacks any behavior that could be malicious or suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization or module file with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply imports a local module and includes a license statement. There is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
