  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code is a minimal Python snippet containing only a license comment and an import statement. There are no data inputs, outputs, dynamic code execution, or network activity. The import is a relative import of an internal module, which is standard practice in package code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware. They consistently note the lack of data flow, sinks, or anomalies. No logical errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators. Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code shows no signs of malicious activity, the risk scores should remain at 0. The reports correctly do not assign any elevated risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's content.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the code's minimal nature and lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet is benign, standard, and contains no security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The current scoring and analysis are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, and the reports correctly reflect that.",
