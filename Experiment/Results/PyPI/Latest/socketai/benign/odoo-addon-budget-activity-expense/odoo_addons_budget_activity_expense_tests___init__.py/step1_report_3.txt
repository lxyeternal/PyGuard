  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of a license comment and an import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a license declaration and a single import statement of a local module. No data input, processing, or external network interaction occurs. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code are present. The import could be for testing or modular functionality, but by itself, it shows no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple module import with a license header. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
