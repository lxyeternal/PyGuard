  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code contains only a license comment and a simple import statement.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or network activity.\n- The import is a relative import of an internal module, typical in package code, especially for testing.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that this snippet is benign.\n- They correctly note the absence of data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n- No report claims or implies any malicious activity or security risk beyond the minimal import.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n- The scores seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct because the code is trivial and benign.\n- No justification is needed for higher scores here.\n\n**5. Malware Score:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n- No malicious activity or behavior is present.\n\n**6. Challenging Assumptions About Vulnerabilities:**\n- All reports avoid assumptions and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- The import statement, in isolation, does not imply vulnerability.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable, reflecting the minimal and safe nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final System-Level Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code snippet is a straightforward import statement with a license comment.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- The import is internal and typical for package structure, likely for testing purposes.\n- The absence of data flow, external interaction, or obfuscation supports a zero risk assessment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a simple, benign import statement with a license header.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
