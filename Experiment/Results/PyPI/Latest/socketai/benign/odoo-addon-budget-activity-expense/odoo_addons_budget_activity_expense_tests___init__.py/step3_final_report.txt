{
  "purpose": "Minimal Python module containing only a license comment and a relative import of an internal module, likely for testing or internal use.",
  "sources": "The license comment and the relative import statement (`from . import test_budget_activity_expense`)",
  "sinks": "None; no data inputs, outputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution present",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data sources or sinks identified",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license header and a single relative import, typical in package internal modules. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The import is standard for internal testing or modular structure. No data flows or external interactions are present, and the code's simplicity indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The minimal structure and standard import suggest it is part of internal testing or package setup. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
