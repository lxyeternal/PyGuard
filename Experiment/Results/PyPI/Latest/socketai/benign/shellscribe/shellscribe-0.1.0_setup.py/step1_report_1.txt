  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for a CLI tool named 'shellscribe' that uses AI to generate and insert code.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; reads package configuration data from code variables and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sink points for untrusted data; no data leaks or harmful effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this is a setup script without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard setuptools pattern, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No user input, network operations, or code execution occurs here. The dependencies and scripts appear typical for a CLI package. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, nor unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be legitimate, standard package configuration with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
