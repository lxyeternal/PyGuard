{
  "purpose": "This script is used to set up a Python package named 'web3socket' for distribution, defining its metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version from 'web3socket/__init__.py' using a regex search.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present. The setup function is used for packaging, not runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "The version string is extracted from the package's __init__.py file and used directly in the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically reads the version from an external file, which is common in setup scripts. No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and attempts to import 'setuptools' with a fallback to 'distutils'. It extracts the version string from 'web3socket/__init__.py' via regex, which is standard practice. The setup() function specifies package metadata, dependencies, and data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation. The code performs straightforward setup tasks without executing untrusted code or handling user input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply reads version info and calls setup() with static metadata.",
