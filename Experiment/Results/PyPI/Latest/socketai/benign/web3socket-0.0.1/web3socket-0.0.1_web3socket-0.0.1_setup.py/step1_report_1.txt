{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'web3socket', intended to package and distribute the module.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string from 'web3socket/__init__.py' file using regex; loads dependencies via 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; setup parameters are static, and dependencies are predefined.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file (source) to set the package version (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to extract version info dynamically, which is standard; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code observed. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup configuration with no network communication, no execution of untrusted input, and no malicious behavior. The version string extraction via regex from a file is standard practice. No anomalies or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical setup.py file used for packaging Python modules. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
