  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging the web3socket Python project",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__ string from web3socket/__init__.py file",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; setup parameters are hardcoded or derived from the package files",
  "flows": "Reading __version__ from the file → used in setup call",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic extraction of version using regex from a local file; no suspicious code execution or external data fetch; no hidden code, obfuscated parts, or suspicious behaviors",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports setup tools, extracts the package version from a local file, and calls setup() with static package information. It performs a straightforward version extraction with regex, which is common in package setup scripts. There are no network operations, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input sources. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code are evident. The script adheres to standard package setup practices without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It securely reads the package version from a file and proceeds with standard packaging procedures.",
