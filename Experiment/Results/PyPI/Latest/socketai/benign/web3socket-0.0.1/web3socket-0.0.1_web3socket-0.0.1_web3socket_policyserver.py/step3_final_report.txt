  "purpose": "Implement a simple Flash cross-domain policy server that listens on port 843 and serves a static XML policy allowing all domains and ports.",
  "sources": "Socket connections accepted on port 843, no external data fetching or user input processing.",
  "sinks": "socket.sendall() transmitting the static XML policy XML to clients.",
  "flows": "Connection accepted -> optional logging -> socket.sendall(policy XML).",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and serves a static policy XML without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a benign server serving a permissive cross-domain policy XML. It uses gevent's StreamServer for asynchronous handling, listening on port 843, and responds with a static XML allowing all domains and ports. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The permissiveness of the policy XML is typical for such servers but could be a security concern in some contexts. The code is clear, with no logical errors or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk between 0.1 and 0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a Flash cross-domain policy server. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The permissive policy XML could pose security considerations but is not malicious. The reported scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
