  "purpose": "Serve a cross-domain policy file for Flash clients to allow cross-origin socket connections.",
  "sources": "Reads incoming socket connection when a client connects (via handle method).",
  "sinks": "Sends the cross-domain policy XML over the socket connection.",
  "flows": "Client connects -> handle method invoked -> socket.sendall(policy) executed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior. The policy allows all domains and ports, which is typical for a permissive cross-domain policy but not malicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a server class that serves a permissive cross-domain policy XML for Flash clients. It listens on port 843 by default. The handle method sends the policy to clients, which is standard for such servers. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. No suspicious code patterns or malicious intent are apparent. The server's functionality is straightforward and typical for a cross-domain policy server.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard Flash cross-domain policy server with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign implementation serving a broad cross-origin access policy, common in Flash-based applications.",
