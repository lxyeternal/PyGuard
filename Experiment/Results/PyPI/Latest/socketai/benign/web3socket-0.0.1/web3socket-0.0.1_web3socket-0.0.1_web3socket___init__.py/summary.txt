  "conclusion": "The dependency is a legitimate implementation of a WebSocket-like protocol with known cryptographic weaknesses and minimal validation. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage. The security concerns are due to weak cryptography and validation, not malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting security weaknesses but no malicious behavior."
