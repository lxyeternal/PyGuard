{
  "purpose": "This code implements a simple web application that serves static files and manages WebSocket connections for real-time communication.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('PATH_INFO', 'web3socket'), file system (open(path)), socket data (socket.receive()), and server commands.",
  "sinks": "Socket.send() method for outgoing messages, file reading for serving static content, print statements for logging.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and socket.receive() flows into server logic; data sent through socket.send(); file content loaded and served to clients.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert message is None' in receive method; reliance on a global 'PORT' variable; minimal error handling around socket communication; no validation of environment variables or socket data.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a web server handling WebSocket connections and static file serving. It spawns greenlets for concurrent socket receive and send operations. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible. The use of 'assert message is None' may lead to server interruption if messages are unexpected. The code reads files without sanitization but only serves static content. No malicious network activity, data leakage, or backdoors are evident. The logic appears straightforward, with no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. Potential security concerns include unvalidated socket data and minimal error handling, but these do not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard WebSocket server with static file serving capabilities, showing no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It contains minor security considerations but no malware or supply chain attacks are evident.",
