However, this is a code correctness or robustness issue, not malware.\n- No evidence of code injection, remote code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- No signs of supply chain compromise or backdoors.\n- The static file serving and socket management appear routine.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.2** — minimal security concerns, primarily around input validation and server robustness, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- Slightly increase the risk score to 0.3 if you consider the `assert` statement as a potential crash vector, but since it does not involve malicious code, 0.2 remains reasonable.\n- No change needed for malware or obfuscation scores.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the detailed review, **the code is benign**, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected. The minor security issues are typical for such server code and do not constitute active threats.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (or possibly 0.3 if considering robustness concerns)\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to prepare a summarized report or further analysis.",
