  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard server implementation for WebSocket and static file serving. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident. Exception handling is broad but typical for server code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity justify a malware score of 0. The risk score is low, reflecting typical server concerns.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on static file serving and server management. No suspicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are justified.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and the risk is low.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical WebSocket server with static file serving, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malware or obfuscation; the broad exception handling does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, standard server functions with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are justified.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation; exception handling is broad but typical.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical server setup with static content and WebSocket support. Static file serving based on environment variables, with no evident malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are consistent.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity or code is detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, indicating code clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** 0.2 across all reports reflect typical server operation concerns, such as broad exception handling and potential input validation issues, but nothing severe.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- Given the absence of any malicious indicators, I would maintain the current scores.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 (considering broad exception handling and static file serving without sanitization)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears benign, well within standard server implementation practices, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or high security risk.",
