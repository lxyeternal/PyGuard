  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes server functions; sources are environment variables, filesystem, and server properties.\n- **Sinks:** Writes to sys.stderr, logs, and network sockets—standard for server code.\n- **Anomalies:** Broad exception handling ('except:'), deprecated syntax (IOError, ex), no input validation, dynamic string formatting that could raise exceptions.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a standard WebSocket and static file server with proper resource management. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. Exception handling could be improved, but this is common in server code.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity detected. The confidence is high (0.9). Malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and security risk is low (0.2). These are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores align well with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; accurate.\n- **Sinks:** File reads, logs, HTTP responses—standard.\n- **Anomalies:** Broad exception handling, no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a legitimate WebSocket server with static file serving, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Reasonable; no malware, obfuscation, or high risk. Confidence at 0.9 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; environment variables, socket, files.\n- **Sinks:** File reading, stderr, network communication—standard.\n- **Anomalies:** Broad exception handling, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Analysis:** Typical server code; no malicious behavior or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The assessment is correct; scores reflect the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; environment variables, socket, files.\n- **Sinks:** File reads, logs, network responses.\n- **Anomalies:** Broad exception handling, use of 'assert' for version check, static file serving without sanitization.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a standard WebSocket server with static content; potential minor concern about input validation, but no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The reasoning is sound; no malware or obfuscation. Security risk remains low (0.2). Confidence at 0.9 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks:** File reading, HTTP responses, logs.\n- **Anomalies:** Broad exception handling, serving static files directly based on environment variables without sanitization.\n- **Analysis:** Typical server setup; no signs of malicious activity or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores align well.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0, and the reasoning confirms no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above 0.2 (0.2) in all cases, reflecting typical server code with minor exception handling concerns—reasonable.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0.2** (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are thorough, and their scores are justified. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks exists in the provided code. The broad exception handling is a minor concern but not malicious. The code appears to be a standard, benign WebSocket server implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n- The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the broad exception handling but no actual vulnerabilities.  \n- The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.",
