  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is standard server code with broad exception handling, but nothing suspicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The low risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the benign nature. Malware=0 aligns with the lack of malicious activity. The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring appears consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the code is standard server code for WebSocket and static file serving, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Again, the low risk score is appropriate. No malware detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical WebSocket server with static file handling, no suspicious network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is justified. No malware, no obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, with no signs of malicious activity. The broad exception handling is noted but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is appropriate. No malware detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a server for WebSocket and static content, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. Minor concerns about broad exception handling and static file serving without sanitization, but these are typical server patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The risk score remains low; no malware detected.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, scoring 0.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation, scoring 0.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low (0.2), which is reasonable given the benign analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all, consistent with the code and analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 remains appropriate; no significant security risk detected.\n\n**Additional notes:** The broad exception handling, while not ideal, is common in server code and does not imply malicious intent. The static file serving could be improved with sanitization, but as is, it does not suggest malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese reflect a benign, well-understood server implementation with no malicious activity detected.",
