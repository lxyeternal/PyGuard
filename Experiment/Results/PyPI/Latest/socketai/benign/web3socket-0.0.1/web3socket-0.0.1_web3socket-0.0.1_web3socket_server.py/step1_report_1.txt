  "purpose": "Implements a WebSocket and Flash policy server with custom handling for web3socket connections, serving static files, and managing server lifecycle.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('PATH_INFO', 'HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH'), filesystem files (open, read), and server properties (server_host, server_port).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to sys.stderr, server logs, and network sockets during start/kill and logging operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and filesystem data flow into request handling and static file serving; server lifecycle and logging flow into output and error streams.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling with 'except:' without specific exception types; deprecated syntax (IOError, ex) in Python 2 style; no explicit input validation; use of dynamic string formatting for logs that may raise exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines server classes for handling WebSocket and Flash policy server interactions, serving static files based on request paths, and managing server start/stop procedures. It uses environment variables and filesystem reads as input sources, with output directed to logs and error streams. No hardcoded credentials or secret data are evident. Exception handling is broad and may suppress critical errors, but this is common in server code. No external inputs (like user input or untrusted data) are processed in a way that could lead to code injection or data leakage. The code appears to follow standard server patterns without obfuscated or suspicious constructs. No malicious behavior or malicious intent is detected. The logic is straightforward and adheres to typical server design, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code implements a standard WebSocket server with static file serving and logging features. It contains no evident malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no suspicious external communications or backdoors. It appears to be a benign server implementation with typical handling of exceptions and environment interactions.",
