  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**1. Report 1**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches exactly the provided code snippet; it initializes and starts a FlashPolicyServer, logs the address, and runs indefinitely.\n- **Logic and reasoning:** The report correctly states that this is a standard server startup script with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified, no malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.\n  - Security risk: 0.2 — perhaps slightly high, but considering the server opens network ports, a low risk is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment seems accurate. No change needed.\n\n**2. Report 2**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, matches the code. No suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Scores:** Similar reasoning applies; malware and obfuscated are 0, low security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**3. Report 3**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Again, code matches the snippet; no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**4. Report 4**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Correctly low malware and obfuscated scores.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**5. Report 5**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same code, same analysis.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward server startup script for a WebSocket policy server.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities is present.\n- The \"malware\" scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are low (0.1-0.2), which seems reasonable given the server opens network ports but is otherwise benign.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — low, given that the server opens network ports but appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports are accurate in their analysis and scoring. The code is a standard server startup script with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No adjustments needed.",
