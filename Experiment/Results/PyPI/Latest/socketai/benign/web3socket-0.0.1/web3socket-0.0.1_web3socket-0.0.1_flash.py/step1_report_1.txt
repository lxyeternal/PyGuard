  "purpose": "Start a Flash policy server for Web3socketSocketServer to serve policy files for WebSocket connections.",
  "sources": "Importing Web3socket.policyserver and instantiating FlashPolicyServer, which initiates server startup and possibly network listening.",
  "sinks": "server.start() and server.serve_forever() involve network sockets listening for incoming connections.",
  "flows": "The code initializes the server object, starts the server, and then enters an infinite loop to serve incoming connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual code constructs. The code appears to be standard server initialization.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a specific server class from a library, initializes it with a 'noisy' parameter, and starts it, which causes it to listen on network ports. It outputs the server address to stderr. The code relies on the external web3socket.policyserver module, and there are no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious network activity within this code snippet. It appears to be a typical server startup script intended for WebSocket policy serving, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward server startup script for serving WebSocket policies, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and standard for its intended purpose.",
