  "purpose": "Start a Flash policy server for WebSocket connections to enable cross-domain access.",
  "sources": "Importing the FlashPolicyServer class from web3socket.policyserver, instantiating and starting the server.",
  "sinks": "The server's network binding (host and port) used for listening for incoming connections.",
  "flows": "Import -> Instantiate server -> Start server -> Log server address -> Serve forever.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or obfuscated elements detected. Use of a server class that may serve cross-origin policies could be benign or malicious depending on context, but in this context, it appears standard for WebSocket policy serving.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a server class from a library, initializes it with a 'noisy' parameter, starts the server, and logs its listening address. The server is likely intended to serve cross-domain WebSocket policy files, which is a common necessity in WebSocket deployments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network connections to suspicious domains. The code is straightforward and uses standard library features for server operation. No malicious payloads, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. It simply starts a server process to serve policy files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard server startup script for WebSocket cross-domain policy serving. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain risks. Its security risk level is low, assuming the library it uses is trustworthy. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
