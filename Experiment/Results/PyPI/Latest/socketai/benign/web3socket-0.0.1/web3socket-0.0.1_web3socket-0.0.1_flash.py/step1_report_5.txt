  "purpose": "Start a Flash policy server using the web3socket library, primarily for WebSocket security purposes.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module; instantiating FlashPolicyServer object; calling server.start() and server.serve_forever()",
  "sinks": "server.start() and server.serve_forever() potentially opening network ports and listening for incoming connections",
  "flows": "The server initializes and listens for incoming WebSocket policy requests, potentially exposing a server endpoint",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, or unusual code behavior. The script is straightforward, starting a server.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and a class from web3socket.policyserver, then creates a FlashPolicyServer instance with noisy=True. It starts the server and logs its listening address to stderr, then runs serve_forever(), which likely keeps the server running indefinitely. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or code injection. The server’s purpose is to serve WebSocket security policies, which is a standard function. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are present. The code performs a benign network service setup aligned with its stated purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code sets up and runs a WebSocket Flash Policy server without any indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard implementation for serving WebSocket policies, with no malicious behavior detected.",
