  "purpose": "Start a WebSocket Flash Policy Server to serve cross-origin WebSocket policies.",
  "sources": "Importing the FlashPolicyServer class and initializing it with 'noisy=True'.",
  "sinks": "Network socket listening on server_host and server_port, logging to stderr.",
  "flows": "Initialization of server object -> server.start() -> server.serve_forever()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward server startup script for a WebSocket policy server. It imports a class, initializes it with a parameter, starts the server, logs its address, and runs indefinitely. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The server's purpose is legitimate, and the code structure is standard. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign server startup script for WebSocket cross-origin policies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score is appropriate given the server's network exposure, but no malicious intent is detected.",
