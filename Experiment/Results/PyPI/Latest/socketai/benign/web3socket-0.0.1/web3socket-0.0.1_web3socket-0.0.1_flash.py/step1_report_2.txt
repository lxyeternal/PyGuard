  "purpose": "To start a Web3 socket server that includes a flash policy server for client connections.",
  "sources": "Importing FlashPolicyServer from web3socket.policyserver, initializing the server object",
  "sinks": "server.start(), server.serve_forever(), writing to sys.stderr",
  "flows": "Import -> Initialize server -> Start server -> Log server details -> Run server indefinitely",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code appears straightforward in starting a service.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a FlashPolicyServer class, initializes it with 'noisy=True', starts the server, and logs server host and port information to standard error, then runs indefinitely. No external data inputs, no data leaks, or suspicious behavior detected. The server's purpose appears to be to serve flash policy files for socket connections, which is typical for WebSocket configurations. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with legitimate server startup routines without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard server initialization script for a WebSocket flash policy server. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected. It functions as a network service setup with no signs of malware or security threats.",
