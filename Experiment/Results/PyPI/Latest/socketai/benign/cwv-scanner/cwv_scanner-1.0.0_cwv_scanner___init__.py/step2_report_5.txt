  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a static version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external data access, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and typical for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores align well with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential for Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation**:\n   - Since the code is static and does not perform any operations beyond assignment, there is no basis for malware.\n   - No obfuscation is present; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - The absence of dynamic or external components supports the benign assessment.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is clear, simple, and un-obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks identified; the code is benign.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- Given the code's simplicity, no further investigation or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**Summary**: The code is a standard, harmless package version declaration with no malicious or suspicious characteristics. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
