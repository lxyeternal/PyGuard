  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow as this is a simple variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; minimal code with no suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a static string '1.0.0' to __version__, which is a common practice in Python packages for versioning. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external communications, or dynamic behaviors. The code does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious constructs. It is a straightforward, standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to specify the package version. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected.",
