  "purpose": "Defines the package version as a static string in a Python module.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static assignment in __init__.py.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, with no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behavior. It does not interact with external systems, perform any computations, or contain suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All analyses and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
