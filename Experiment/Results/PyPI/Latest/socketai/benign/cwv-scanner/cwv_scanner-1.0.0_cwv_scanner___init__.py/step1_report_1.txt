  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; very minimal code with no dynamic or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a static version string to the __version__ variable. It does not read input, access environment variables, or perform any operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is a typical package version declaration, common in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
