  "anomalies": "No anomalies; very minimal code with only a version assignment",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to a variable __version__, which is a common practice for Python packages. There are no input/output operations, no external data access, no code execution, and no suspicious or unusual behavior observed. The file appears to serve only as a version identifier, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, standard, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
