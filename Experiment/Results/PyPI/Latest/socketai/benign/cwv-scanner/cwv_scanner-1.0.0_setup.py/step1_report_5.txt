  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'cwv-scanner' Python project, including dependency specification and entry point configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, specifying dependencies in 'install_requires', and defining entry points for console scripts.",
  "sinks": "Installation dependencies are not a security risk; the console script entry point is safe if the called module is trusted.",
  "flows": "The setup reads the README file, specifies dependencies, and sets up command-line entry points; no untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed. No indications of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setup procedures with 'setuptools', reads a markdown file for long description, and configures package data, dependencies, and console scripts. All elements follow common packaging conventions without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
