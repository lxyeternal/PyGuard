{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to package and distribute a Python project named 'cwv-scanner', which is a web application vulnerability scanner.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; gathers package info via find_packages(); specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'; defines console script entry point.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs that could leak data; no code execution based on external input; no network communication or suspicious operations.",
  "flows": "N/A — standard setup process without external data flows or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with typical package configuration. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for packaging, reads a markdown file for description, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and console entry points. All operations are typical for a Python package setup. The dependencies listed are common libraries for web scraping and HTTP requests. There are no signs of code injection, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. No external network activity, data leakage, or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script appears to be a legitimate, standard package configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares the 'cwv-scanner' package for distribution.",
