  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'cwv-scanner' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; defining package dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data being written or executed.",
  "flows": "Reading file content (source) used as long_description; dependencies specified in install_requires (not flows of untrusted data).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. Use of standard setup practices; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script used for Python package distribution. It reads a README file, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All code uses common modules and practices without any signs of malicious intent or anomalous behavior. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious data flows, and no dynamic or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup file with no malicious or suspicious features. It appears safe and standard for Python packaging.",
