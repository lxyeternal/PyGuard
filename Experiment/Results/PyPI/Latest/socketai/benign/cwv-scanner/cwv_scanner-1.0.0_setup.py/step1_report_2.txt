{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project called 'cwv-scanner', a web application vulnerability scanner.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'; retrieves package information via find_packages(); reads input during setup execution (e.g., reading README.md).",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of setup process, but no untrusted data sinks or external communications are present within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is reading the README.md file into the 'long_description' variable, used for package metadata; no untrusted input flows into executable or external system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The dependencies listed are common and benign. No signs of malicious behavior or anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It reads a README file for package description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No untrusted input is processed in a manner that could lead to code injection or data leakage. The dependencies are typical for a web scanning tool and do not indicate malicious intent. The code structure and syntax are straightforward and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
