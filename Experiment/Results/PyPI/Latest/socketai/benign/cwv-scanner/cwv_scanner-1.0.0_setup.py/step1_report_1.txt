{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'cwv-scanner' package, including dependencies, metadata, and entry point.",
  "sources": "File reading 'README.md' for long description; user input is not directly read; dependencies are specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; dependencies are standard Python packages; no data is sent or received in this script.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this script; it only configures package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated behavior; standard setup script for Python package.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a Markdown file for description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No user input or external untrusted data processing occurs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage are present. All dependencies are common Python packages. The code follows standard practices for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard for Python package distribution.",
