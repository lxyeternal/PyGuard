  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration for 'cwv-scanner', defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; specifies dependencies and entry point 'cwv_scanner.cwv_scanner:main'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reads local README file; no external data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious dependencies. All dependencies are common packages, and the only file I/O is reading a local README.md. The entry point points to a function whose implementation isn't provided, but the setup configuration itself is benign. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a standard, benign package configuration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
