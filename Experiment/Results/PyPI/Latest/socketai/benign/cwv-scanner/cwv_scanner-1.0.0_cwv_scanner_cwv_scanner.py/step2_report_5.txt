  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a web vulnerability scanner performing crawling, passive pattern matching, active payload injection, WAF detection, and result reporting.\n- No report indicates any malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- The code uses standard libraries and patterns typical for security tools.\n- Payloads and detection patterns are predefined and are consistent with legitimate security testing.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code that suggest malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical flaws or errors are evident in the reasoning. The reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Risk scores:** Low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting typical security testing activity, not malicious.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Behavior:** The code's payload injection, pattern matching, and crawling are standard for vulnerability scanners, not malicious exploits.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points:\n- **Active payload injection:** Used for testing vulnerabilities, not malicious purposes.\n- **Pattern matching:** Detects common security issues, typical for security tools.\n- **External JSON files:** Used for configuration, standard practice.\n- **No signs of malware:** No code snippets or logic suggest malicious intent.\n- **WAF detection:** Part of a security assessment, not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected or implied.  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.  \n**Risk score:** **0.1 - 0.2** — minimal, typical for a security testing tool.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments needed; the code is a legitimate security scanner with no malicious features.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured web vulnerability scanner designed for security assessments. It performs active and passive testing without any signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1-0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's behavior.",
