{
  "purpose": "The script is used to configure and build a Python package named 'tdavec' with Cython extensions.",
  "sources": "Input sources include 'tdavec/tdavec_core.pyx' (Cython source file), and external dependencies 'Cython' and 'numpy' specified in setup_requires.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present that process untrusted data; the script primarily performs build configuration without data processing or network communication.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from defining extensions to invoking 'setup()', which prepares the build environment. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is standard for building Cython extensions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for setting up a Cython-based Python package. It defines an extension module using a .pyx Cython source and includes numpy headers. The setup function specifies package metadata and build instructions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation; the script functions solely as a build configuration file. The use of 'cythonize' and 'Extension' is typical in compiling Cython modules. No external data sources, network communication, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for building a Python package with Cython extensions. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
