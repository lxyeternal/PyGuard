{
  "purpose": "To set up and compile a Python package named 'tdavec' with Cython extensions.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, Cython, and numpy; usage of 'setup' function and 'Extension' object for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "The setup process itself primarily involves package compilation; no evident sinks that could lead to data leakage or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Imports and configuration data flow into the setup process, which compiles the extension modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to follow standard packaging procedures for Cython modules. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for package setup, defines a Cython extension with proper include directories, and calls setup() with standard parameters. No untrusted input handling or external network interactions are present. The code performs a straightforward package build process without dynamic code execution or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with Cython extensions. It appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
