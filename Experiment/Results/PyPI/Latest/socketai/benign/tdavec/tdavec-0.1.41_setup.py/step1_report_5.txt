  "purpose": "Setup script for building and installing the 'tdavec' Python package with Cython extension.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools, Cython, and numpy; definitions of extensions; setup() configuration.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data output points.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; this is a build configuration script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with typical build instructions for Cython extensions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for building a Python package with Cython extension. It defines an extension module 'tdavec.tdavec_core' using a '.pyx' source file and includes numpy's headers. The setup() function specifies package metadata and build instructions, including extension compilation via cythonize. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The script performs standard package setup tasks without any suspicious or hidden operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script for compiling a Cython extension. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security issues. It is safe and aligns with common Python package distribution practices.",
