  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a standard setup script for building a Python package called \"tdavec\" with a Cython extension.\n- It imports `setuptools`, `cythonize` from `Cython.Build`, and `numpy`.\n- Defines an extension module `tdavec.tdavec_core` from `tdavec/tdavec_core.pyx`, including numpy headers.\n- Calls `setup()` with package metadata, extensions, and build requirements.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues, errors, or anomalies are present.\n- **Malware or malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent.\n- **Data leakage or external data handling:** Not involved.\n- **Suspicious logic or hardcoded secrets:** Absent.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — the code is purely for package setup.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Justification:\nAll reports agree that this is a standard, benign setup script. They do not identify any suspicious activity, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are consistent with the detailed analyses and the actual code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Note:** If any future reports suggest malicious behavior or obfuscation, scores should be increased accordingly, but based on current evidence, all scores remain at zero.",
