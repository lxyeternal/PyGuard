{
  "purpose": "Set up and build a Python package named 'tdavec' with Cython extensions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools, Cython, and numpy; get_include() call; setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data influences system behavior or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup configuration is standard and static.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. The code follows typical package setup structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary build tools for a Cython extension, defines an extension module with numpy include directories, and calls setup() with standard parameters. All code appears to be related to package setup and compilation, with no external data handling, network operations, or suspicious logic. The use of cythonize and numpy.get_include() is typical for Cython modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or unusual code structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for building a Python package with Cython extensions. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident.",
