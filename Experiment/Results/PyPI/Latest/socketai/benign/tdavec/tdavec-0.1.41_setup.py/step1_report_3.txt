{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for building a Cython-based Python package named 'tdavec'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and configuration data via 'setup', includes a Cython extension source file, and retrieves include directories from numpy.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no data is sent over network or written to files within this script.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from the script into the build process; no untrusted data sources are used, and no untrusted data reaches critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, hard-coded credentials, or suspicious behavior present. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for setting up a Cython extension, defines an extension module using a .pyx file, and configures the package setup with name, version, packages, extensions, and setup requirements. All code appears standard for building a Python package with Cython support. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or other suspicious patterns detected. The code is well-structured and uses common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script for a Cython extension module without any malicious behavior or security concerns identified.",
