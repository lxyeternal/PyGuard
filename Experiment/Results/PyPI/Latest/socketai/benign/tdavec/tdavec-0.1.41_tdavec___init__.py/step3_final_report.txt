  "purpose": "Module initialization for a Python package related to topological data analysis, importing core components and setting exports.",
  "sources": "Static imports from local modules (.vectorizer, .tdavec_core), benign print statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Import statements and optional extension module import; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Optional import of a shared object (.so) library, which could be a supply chain vector but is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package setup with static imports, a benign print statement, and a try-except for optional native extension. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The optional import of a shared library is common for performance extensions and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned by reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module initialization script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The supply chain risk is minimal and primarily related to the integrity of the optional native extension, which cannot be assessed here but does not suggest malicious activity.",
