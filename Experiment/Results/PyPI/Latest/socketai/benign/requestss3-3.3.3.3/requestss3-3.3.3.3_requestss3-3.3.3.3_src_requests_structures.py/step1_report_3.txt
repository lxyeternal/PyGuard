  "purpose": "Provide data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup objects used in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data during initialization (__init__, update, constructor), dictionary key access (__getitem__), method calls (get).",
  "sinks": "Dictionary key access (__getitem__, __delitem__), comparison (__eq__), representation (__repr__), data stored in self._store or __dict__.",
  "flows": "Data is input during object creation or update, stored in internal structures, and accessed via dictionary-like methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data flows. The code primarily implements standard dictionary behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The classes implement standard Python dictionary-like behavior with case-insensitive features. The methods utilize straightforward data storage and retrieval mechanisms. No external inputs are directly used in sensitive operations beyond standard dictionary handling. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code relies on standard library modules and simple data structures, with no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup objects used in the Requests library. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
