{
  "purpose": "Provides data structures for case-insensitive dictionary-like objects used in HTTP headers and other mappings within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), item access (__getitem__, __setitem__), and attribute access (get, __repr__).",
  "sinks": "Data retrieval methods such as __getitem__, get, and __repr__ that could expose internal data.",
  "flows": "Data is stored in internal _store or __dict__, accessed via keys or attribute lookups.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behavior; no external data leaks, no code injection, or network activities present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict, both of which implement dictionary-like behavior. The CaseInsensitiveDict normalizes keys to lower case for case-insensitive access, storing original key casing for representation. It uses an OrderedDict internally for key-value storage. The LookupDict extends dict but allows attribute-style access, with values stored in __dict__ and accessed via get and __getitem__. The code does not perform any network, file, or system modification, nor does it include dynamic code execution or external data flows. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides utility data structures with standard, safe behavior. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks identified. It appears to be straightforward implementation for handling HTTP headers and similar data. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
