  "purpose": "Defines data structures for handling HTTP headers and lookup dictionaries in a case-insensitive manner.",
  "sources": "Initialization of data structures, method calls such as update, get, __getitem__",
  "sinks": "Accessing or manipulating internal dictionaries, particularly __getitem__, get, and update methods",
  "flows": "Input data during initialization or updates flows into internal storage; accessors retrieve data from internal storage",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard case-insensitive dictionary-like objects with no external data flows that could lead to security issues. No user input is processed in a way that could cause code injection or data leaks. The data structures do not perform network operations, execute code, or handle sensitive information. The methods are straightforward, primarily manipulating internal dictionaries without any malicious logic or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides utility classes for case-insensitive headers and lookup dictionaries with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard, well-structured code without suspicious elements.",
