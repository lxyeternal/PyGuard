{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling errors in the Requests library, including various HTTP and connection errors, with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and local compat module; class initializations and attribute access within exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; exception classes do not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and raising; no data flow involving untrusted sources; standard class inheritance and attribute setting.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of __reduce__ method in JSONDecodeError for pickling support, which is standard and not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various exception types related to HTTP requests. It imports standard exceptions and defines subclasses with straightforward constructors. The __reduce__ method in JSONDecodeError is a common pattern for serialization and does not introduce security risks. No dynamic code execution, external communication, or suspicious patterns are present. The exception hierarchy and import statements are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for a request handling library. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The __reduce__ method is a typical pattern for pickling support and does not pose a security concern. The overall malware score is 0, security risk is 0, and obfuscation is 0.",
