  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for a request handling library. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The __reduce__ method is a typical pattern for pickling support and does not pose a security concern. The overall malware score is 0, security risk is 0, and obfuscation is 0."
