  "purpose": "Define a set of exception classes for handling various error conditions in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Imported modules: urllib3.exceptions and .compat.JSONDecodeError",
  "sinks": "None present; the code defines exception classes without handling untrusted data or performing actions that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow occurs involving untrusted input to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard exception class definitions and inheritance. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes for the requests library, inheriting from standard Python exceptions and external modules. It imports exceptions and defines subclasses with docstrings. No data processing, input handling, or execution logic present. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be straightforward and standard for a library error module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical set of exception class definitions for error handling within the requests library. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign component that simply defines error types.",
