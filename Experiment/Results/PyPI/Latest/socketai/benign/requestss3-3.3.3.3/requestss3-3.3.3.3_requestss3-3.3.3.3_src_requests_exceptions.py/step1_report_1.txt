  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for handling various errors and warnings within the Requests library, mainly related to HTTP requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and a local compat module for JSONDecodeError.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not include data handling, network operations, or untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "The code only defines classes and imports; no runtime data flow or execution paths exist.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or potentially malicious logic are present. The code is straightforward class definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code provides exception classes for error handling in a request library, including custom exceptions for JSON decoding, HTTP errors, connection issues, and warnings. The class hierarchy is typical for exception handling. There are no data inputs, outputs, or runtime behavior that could be malicious. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions for a requests-like library. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected. The module appears to serve as a safe, structural component of the larger library.",
