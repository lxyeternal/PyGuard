  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the reported issues with the code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Describes utility classes/functions for cookie handling, reading request headers, response headers, and managing cookies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is standard cookie management code.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.0\n\n**Assessment**: The report's conclusion is consistent with the code. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Similar to report 1, focusing on cookie utilities, reading headers, and request/response data.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: No signs of malicious activity; standard cookie handling.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.0\n\n**Assessment**: The conclusion aligns with the code. No suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Same general purpose, reading request/response headers, cookie parameters.\n- **Analysis**: No malicious code, no network activity, no obfuscation. The securityRisk score is 0.2, which is slightly above zero, but the reasoning indicates a benign assessment.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, risk=0.0\n\n**Assessment**: The low securityRisk score seems reasonable given the benign nature. The report correctly states no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Utility functions for cookie management, similar to previous reports.\n- **Analysis**: No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The securityRisk score is 0.2, reflecting minor concern perhaps due to the potential misuse of cookie data but no actual malicious behavior.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, risk=0.0\n\n**Assessment**: The scores and conclusion are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Similar cookie utility functions, reading headers, request/response data.\n- **Analysis**: No malicious code or obfuscation, standard patterns.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.0\n\n**Assessment**: The conclusion matches the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code content**: All reports describe standard cookie handling utilities with no obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score**: All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score**: All are 0, consistent with the code being straightforward.\n- **Security risk**: Slightly above zero (0.2) in some reports, likely due to the potential for cookie data misuse, but no actual malicious activity is evident.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score**: Given the code's benign nature, I would assign a **0.1** to **0.2** maximum, mainly for the potential misuse of cookie data but no actual security flaw.\n\n**My overall assessment**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0.1–0.2 (due to the potential for cookie data misuse, but no active vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a standard, benign utility module for cookie management in the requests library. No malicious or obfuscated code is present, and the minor security risk scores are justified by the potential misuse of cookie data, not by actual vulnerabilities.",
