  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for handling cookies within the requests library, including extraction, setting, and management of cookies via headers and cookie jars.",
  "sources": "Request headers, response headers, cookie jar data structures, and request objects.",
  "sinks": "Cookie headers sent in requests, cookie jar modifications, and internal cookie data storage.",
  "flows": "Request headers are read to extract cookies; cookies are stored or retrieved from the cookie jar; cookies are added to request headers for subsequent requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no network activity or external data leaks, no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie management utilities using well-established Python modules and patterns. It handles cookie extraction from responses, cookie header generation for requests, and cookie jar management, including creation, copying, and merging. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code operates solely within memory and header manipulation, with no network connections or data exfiltration. The security implications are minimal, primarily related to cookie handling, which is inherently sensitive but managed here with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for cookie handling in the requests library. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is negligible. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting cautious handling of cookie data but no active vulnerabilities.",
