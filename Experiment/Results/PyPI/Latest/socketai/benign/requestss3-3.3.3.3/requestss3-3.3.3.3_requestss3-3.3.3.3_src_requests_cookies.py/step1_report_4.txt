  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for managing cookies in the requests library, including creating, extracting, and manipulating cookies and cookie jars.",
  "sources": "Reading request headers, reading response headers, accessing cookie data, reading cookie parameters, and reading environment variables such as time.",
  "sinks": "Adding headers to requests, setting and removing cookies in the jar, creating cookies, and copying cookies between jars.",
  "flows": "From input sources such as request headers, response headers, and cookie dictionaries, through functions like create_cookie and morsel_to_cookie, into cookie jars via set_cookie and update, and then possibly retrieved via get or iteration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Usage of threading is standard for thread-safe operations. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic code execution is evident. The code appears to be standard cookie management logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for handling cookies in the requests library, including creating cookies from parameters, converting Morsel objects, extracting cookies from responses, and managing cookie jars. It includes thread-safe mechanisms and compatibility features. No code demonstrates malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels. The functions operate strictly on cookie data and headers, with no indication of malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be well-structured, maintainable, and secure, fulfilling its intended purpose without security risks.",
