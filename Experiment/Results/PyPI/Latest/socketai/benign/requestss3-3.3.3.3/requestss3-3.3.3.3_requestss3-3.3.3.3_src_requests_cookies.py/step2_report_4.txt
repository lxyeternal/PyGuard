  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and whether any scores need adjustment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Describes utility classes/functions for cookie handling, with input from request objects and response headers, and output into cookie jars and headers.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. Uses standard Python modules, straightforward logic.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully benign, accurate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to Report 1, standard cookie management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no network activity, standard use of modules.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, benign.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly scored.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Again, cookie utilities with reading/writing cookies, headers, etc.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, benign cookie management code.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — the small risk score seems to reflect a conservative approach, perhaps due to the handling of cookies which could, in some contexts, be misused if misconfigured, but nothing in the code suggests actual malicious intent.\n\n**Justification for risk=0.2:** Slightly elevated due to the potential misuse of cookie data, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious code present.\n\n**Scores for malware and obfuscated:** Correctly low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar cookie management utilities.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no malicious patterns, standard code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — again, a conservative minor risk score.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Standard cookie utilities, no suspicious code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no malicious activity, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None detected.\n- **Scores for malware and obfuscated:** Consistently zero across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly elevated (0.2) in some reports, possibly reflecting the potential for cookie misuse but no active vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, considering the potential for cookie misuse but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is standard, well-structured, and safe. The small risk scores are justified as conservative estimates of potential misuse, but no actual security issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code is benign utility code for cookie management with no signs of malicious intent.",
