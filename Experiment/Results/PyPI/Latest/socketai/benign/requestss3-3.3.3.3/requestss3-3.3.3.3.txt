      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious or supply chain attack techniques, primarily through dynamic script creation/execution and social engineering tactics. While no direct malicious payloads are present, the pattern is highly suspicious and warrants caution. The high malware and security risk scores reflect the potential for abuse."

The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting cautious handling of cookie data but no active vulnerabilities."

The security risk is minimal, primarily due to namespace manipulation potential, but this is controlled and intentional."
