  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by aliasing 'urllib3', 'idna', and optionally 'chardet' modules under 'requests.packages' namespace.",
  "sources": "Imports of 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet' modules; sys.modules dictionary for aliasing.",
  "sinks": "sys.modules entries where modules are assigned under 'requests.packages' namespace.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are assigned to sys.modules entries, then aliased under 'requests.packages' namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Manipulation of sys.modules to create namespace aliases; no malicious code or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard imports and manipulates sys.modules to alias modules for legacy support. No network, data leaks, or malicious behavior detected. The sys.modules manipulation is unusual but a known pattern for compatibility. No obfuscation or malicious intent observed. The manipulation could be exploited if environment is compromised, but in this context, it is controlled and deliberate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility shim with no malicious intent. The sys.modules aliasing is a known pattern for legacy support. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to namespace manipulation potential, but this is controlled and intentional.",
