{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup and dependency validation script for the 'requests' Python library, ensuring environment compatibility and fallback mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Version variables from imported libraries, environment checks, and fallback import statements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks; primarily version assertions, warnings, and fallback imports.",
  "flows": "Dependency version checks and fallback mechanisms do not process untrusted input or lead to data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code performs routine environment validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency version assertions, SSL fallback setup, and warning configurations. It does not execute network requests, handle untrusted input, or contain obfuscated constructs. All behaviors are standard for environment setup scripts. No malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The dependency checks and fallback mechanisms are typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard environment setup script for the 'requests' library, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting benign dependency checks and fallback mechanisms.",
