{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility to output the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location using certifi's where() function.",
  "sinks": "The output is printed to standard output; no untrusted data is processed or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The source (certifi's where()) is called and its output is printed directly to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the certifi package and calls its 'where' function to retrieve the path to the CA bundle. The code then prints this path if executed as the main program. The code is straightforward and standard for a utility script, with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. No external data input is processed, and the code does not perform network operations or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign utility script designed to output the location of the certifi CA bundle. There are no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
