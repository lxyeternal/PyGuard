{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility to output the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for packaging or environment configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'certifi' package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The output of the script (the CA bundle path) could be used by other processes or scripts, but there are no direct sinks that lead to data leaks or system modifications within this code.",
  "flows": "The script imports the 'where' function from certifi, and upon execution, prints the CA bundle path. The flow is straightforward: import -> execute -> print.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and standard: it imports a function from the certifi package and prints its return value. No user input, no network activity, no data manipulation. The purpose appears to be to inform or assist packaging scripts. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves a straightforward utility function related to SSL certificate configuration. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
