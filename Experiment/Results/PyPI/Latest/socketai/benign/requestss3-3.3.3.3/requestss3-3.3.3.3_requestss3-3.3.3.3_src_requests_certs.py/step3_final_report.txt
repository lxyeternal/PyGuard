{
  "purpose": "This script outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' and the print statement",
  "sinks": "None; the code only prints a path, no untrusted data processing or data leaks",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' -> print(where())",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no suspicious or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal utility that imports a trusted function from 'certifi' and prints its output. It performs no network activity, data manipulation, or input processing. The purpose is to report the location of the CA bundle, which is a standard, benign operation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code relies on a well-known, trusted package, and its simplicity reduces the likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script with no malicious or security concerns. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward purpose, and the current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and appropriate.",
