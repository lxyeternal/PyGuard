{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, mainly for packaging or environment configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'certifi' package via the 'where' function to determine the CA bundle location.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - the flow is simply importing 'where' from 'certifi' and printing its value.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and standard for its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from 'certifi', which returns the path to the CA bundle. When executed as a script, it prints this path. There are no suspicious activities such as data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or network connections. The code appears to be a benign utility for configuration purposes, with clear documentation and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for returning the default CA bundle location used by 'requests'. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation is standard and safe.",
