  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path, which could be used for informational purposes.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function retrieves a trusted certificate bundle path, and the print statement outputs this data to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, and no external data inputs or network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library function from the well-known 'certifi' package and prints its result. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The module's purpose is to provide the location of the trusted CA bundle, which is typical for request or security-related modules. The code is simple, clean, and relies on standard, trusted packages. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving a straightforward purpose of reporting the trusted CA bundle location. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
