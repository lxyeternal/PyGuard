  "purpose": "This script outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package, primarily for verifying SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the 'where' function import and the call within the main block.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path, which is benign and not a security sink.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the 'where' function (source) to the standard output (sink) via the 'print' statement.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from certifi and prints its output when executed directly. It serves a simple utility purpose without any user input, external data fetching, or dynamic code execution. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to display the path to the CA certificate bundle. It contains no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
