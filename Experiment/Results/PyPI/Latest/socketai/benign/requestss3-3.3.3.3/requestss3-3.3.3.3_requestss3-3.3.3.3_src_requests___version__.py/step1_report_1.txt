  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library, including title, description, version, author, license, and related info.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string literals and constants defining metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this is purely metadata declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code contains only straightforward metadata assignments with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static metadata variables for the requests package, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and copyright. The content is standard package metadata with no external input, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no suspicious behaviors. The presence of decorative comments does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as package metadata declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
