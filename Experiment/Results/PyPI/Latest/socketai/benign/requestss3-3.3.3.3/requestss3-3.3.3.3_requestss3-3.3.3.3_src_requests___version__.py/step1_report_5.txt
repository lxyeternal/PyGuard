  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata variables (e.g., __title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only sets static variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of metadata definitions and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical metadata header for a Python package, with no dynamic or user input handling. It contains only variable assignments with static string values, comments, and Unicode characters used decoratively. No code execution, input/output operations, or network activity is present. There are no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or suspicious code, and no malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata documentation for the 'requests' package and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
