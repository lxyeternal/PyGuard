  "sources": "Constant string assignments in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as the code only assigns static string values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is purely metadata declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments defining package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright. It includes decorative ASCII art comments but no functional code, input handling, external data access, or dynamic execution. The variables are static strings, and there are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, serving only as metadata for the 'requests' package. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
