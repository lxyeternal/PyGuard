  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and decorative comments.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, etc.) and ASCII art comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static metadata variables are assigned once and not used further.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative ASCII art comments; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata, with no dynamic code, external inputs, network calls, or executable logic. The ASCII art comments are purely decorative. All five reviews correctly identify the code as benign, metadata-only, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static and harmless nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or vulnerabilities. The high confidence scores reflect certainty about its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package metadata declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reviews are accurate, and the current scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
