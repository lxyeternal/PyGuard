  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright information.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this code only assigns metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of decorative comments with ASCII art; all variables are static string assignments with no dynamic code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments for package metadata, which is typical in Python modules for package info. No external data input, no code execution, no environment variable usage, nor any suspicious constructs. The ASCII art comments are purely decorative and do not affect execution. No indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard metadata definition for the 'requests' library and contains no malicious or security-threatening content.",
