  "purpose": "Defines package metadata for the 'requests' Python library, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Metadata assignments in the code (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process or execute untrusted data or perform actions affecting external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static string and numeric values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code detected. All code consists of straightforward metadata variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of defining package metadata variables with static values. No input handling, no data processing, no external calls, and no dynamic execution. It appears to be part of a package's __init__.py or setup configuration, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, solely providing package metadata without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
