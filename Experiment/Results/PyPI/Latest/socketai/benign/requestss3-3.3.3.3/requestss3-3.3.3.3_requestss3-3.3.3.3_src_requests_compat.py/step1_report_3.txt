{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility support for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and includes utility functions for character detection and URL handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, version info from sys, and attempts to import 'simplejson' or 'json'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or outputted; the code primarily performs safe import and compatibility tasks.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to setting compatibility variables, with no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code follows standard compatibility patterns and import structures.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes compatibility functions and imports for Python 2 and 3, including conditional imports for JSON handling and character detection libraries. It uses try-except blocks to safely import optional modules and sets flags accordingly. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard for maintaining compatibility across Python versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only performs import and compatibility setup tasks, which are common in open-source packages.",
