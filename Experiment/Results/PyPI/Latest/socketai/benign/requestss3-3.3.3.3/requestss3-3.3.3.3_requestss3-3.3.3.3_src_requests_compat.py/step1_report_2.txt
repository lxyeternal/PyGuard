  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling character detection, JSON parsing, and URL manipulations across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules like importlib, sys, simplejson, json, collections, http, io, urllib, and standard Python built-ins.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains direct data sinks that handle untrusted input, such as executing code, writing to files, or network operations.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports modules and sets up compatibility functions; it does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The import resolution and compatibility code are standard and unremarkable.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for optional modules, sets compatibility flags, and imports standard libraries. No execution of untrusted data or suspicious patterns are detected. The code appears to be boilerplate for compatibility purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard compatibility boilerplate without malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
