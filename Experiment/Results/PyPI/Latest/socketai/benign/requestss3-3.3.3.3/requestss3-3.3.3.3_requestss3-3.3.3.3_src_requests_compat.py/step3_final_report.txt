  "purpose": "Compatibility module handling differences between Python 2 and 3, managing import resolution for character detection libraries, JSON modules, and standard library imports for URL parsing and HTTP handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for optional libraries ('chardet', 'charset_normalizer', 'simplejson'), version info from sys, standard library modules for URL parsing, JSON, collections, and HTTP.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external network calls.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows involving untrusted input or malicious payloads are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, standard compatibility boilerplate with safe import practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs safe, conditional imports of optional dependencies, detects Python version to set compatibility flags, and defines aliases for string and numeric types. It contains no dynamic code execution, no data processing from untrusted sources, and no suspicious patterns. The structure and content align with typical compatibility modules used in open-source projects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, well-structured module intended for maintaining compatibility across Python versions.",
