{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling different Python versions and dependencies, primarily related to character detection and URL handling.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module() for dynamic library import, sys.version_info for Python version detection, import statements for json/simplejson, and various standard library modules.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data output identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the code primarily performs static imports and version checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The import logic is standard for compatibility layers.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes compatibility layers for different Python versions and optional dependencies like 'chardet' and 'simplejson'. It uses dynamic importing to load optional libraries safely and falls back to standard libraries if unavailable. The version detection and imports are typical for a compatibility module. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or potentially malicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and appears to be standard boilerplate for a Python package's compatibility layer.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard compatibility and utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs typical practices for version and dependency management, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
