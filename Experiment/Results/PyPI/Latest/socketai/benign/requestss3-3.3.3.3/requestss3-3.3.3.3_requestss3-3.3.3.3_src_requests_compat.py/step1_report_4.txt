{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility and utility functions for handling string types, importing modules, and URL parsing in Python 2 and 3 environments.",
  "sources": "import statements, sys.version_info, dynamic import via importlib, module attributes (e.g., sys.version_info), and exception handling for optional modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data; the code primarily handles imports, version detection, and utility functions without executing or processing external or untrusted input",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code's flow is mainly static module setup and compatibility handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is standard compatibility boilerplate with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors",
  "analysis": "The script is a compatibility module that imports necessary libraries and defines variables to handle differences between Python 2 and Python 3. It dynamically resolves character detection libraries, manages imports for JSON parsing, and defines string types for compatibility. All operations are standard and do not involve processing untrusted data, executing external commands, or modifying system state. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The code appears to be a typical, well-structured compatibility layer with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves as a compatibility utility for different Python versions. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks present.",
