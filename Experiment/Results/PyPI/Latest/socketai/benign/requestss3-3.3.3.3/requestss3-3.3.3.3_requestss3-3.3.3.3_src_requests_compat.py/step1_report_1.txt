{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as character detection libraries.",
  "sources": "importlib (for dynamic module import), sys (for Python version info), standard library modules (collections, http, io, urllib, etc.)",
  "sinks": "None identified; no use of untrusted input or data flows leading to sensitive operations",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; code primarily imports modules and sets compatibility variables",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected; code performs standard compatibility imports and checks",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles import resolution, version detection, and compatibility setup. It dynamically imports character detection libraries if available, and sets up version flags and compatibility aliases. No data is read from untrusted sources, nor are there any sinks or external calls that could be exploited. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured compatibility module with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard compatibility utility module without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious patterns. No security concerns are present based on this analysis.",
