  "purpose": "Web scraper that constructs URLs, fetches pages, and extracts product data from a website.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET requests to constructed URLs, parsing HTML content with BeautifulSoup.",
  "sinks": "In-memory data structures; no external data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "flows": "Request to URL -> Response -> HTML parsing -> Product object creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward web scraper utilizing standard libraries. It builds URLs based on categories and page numbers, fetches HTML content, and extracts product details such as title, price, image, and description. No malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors, are present. External libraries used are common and do not indicate malicious intent. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily due to external dependencies and potential misuse in scraping, but no actual security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign, standard web scraper with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the provided reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
