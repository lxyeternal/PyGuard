  "purpose": "Definition of constants representing various device or item categories with specific numeric identifiers.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded assignments of constant variables with static integer values.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data processing, input/output, or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all assignments are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden logic, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments defining constants for different categories. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. There are no functions, network operations, or other behaviors that could be malicious. The constants are straightforward and static, serving likely as identifiers or enumeration values.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple set of constant definitions for categorization purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks present in this snippet.",
