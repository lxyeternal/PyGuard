  "purpose": "Define device and category identifiers as static constants for use in categorization or configuration within a larger system.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data, only defines constants.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; the code consists solely of static assignments with no dynamic execution or data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward constant definitions with clear naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static enumeration of device categories with integer identifiers, serving as configuration constants. It contains no functions, input/output, dynamic code, or external dependencies. The constants include positive, negative, and zero values, which are typical for categorization purposes. The code shows no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or suspicious patterns. All review reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero, with high confidence levels. The structure and content are consistent across reports, and the reasoning is sound. Given the absence of dynamic behavior, external data handling, or suspicious constructs, the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static set of constants representing device categories, with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
