  "purpose": "Define constant integer identifiers for various device categories and special labels.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or output statements.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input/output, or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures identified. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments defining constants with integer values. The constants are named systematically, representing device types and categories. No functions, dynamic code execution, or data handling observed. The values include positive, negative, and zero, but these are standard for enumeration purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of constant definitions for device categories and labels. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be configuration or enumeration data used elsewhere in a larger application.",
