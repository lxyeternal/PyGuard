{
  "purpose": "The code defines a series of constant variables representing different electronic devices or categories, likely used for categorization or identification purposes.",
  "sources": "Constants are defined directly within the code; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or points where untrusted data could cause a security issue are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive operations; the code only assigns static values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The variable names are descriptive and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static variable assignments with no dynamic execution, external input handling, or network operations. The constants appear to be used for categorization or identification. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious logic. The structure is simple and static, indicating no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of constant definitions representing device categories or types. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and purposeful within a categorization context.",
