  "purpose": "Define a Product class for storing product details such as title, image, price, and description.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the __init__ method: title, image, price, description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to instance variables after stripping whitespace; no data flows to external sinks or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with an initializer that sanitizes input strings by stripping whitespace. The __str__ method formats object data into a string. No external data sources, network communication, or insecure operations are present. The class serves as a data container without any malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a data class with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
