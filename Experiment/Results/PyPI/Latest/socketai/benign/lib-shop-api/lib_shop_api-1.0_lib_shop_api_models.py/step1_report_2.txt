{
  "purpose": "Define a Product class to hold product information such as title, image, price, and description.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the __init__ method: title, image, price, description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data is being sent over networks or written to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to object attributes; no further data processing or external data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated elements, and no unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with an initializer that strips whitespace from input parameters and assigns them to instance variables. The __str__ method returns a tuple-like string representation of the attributes. There are no external data sources, network operations, or security-sensitive operations involved. The code appears standard for a data container class without any malicious intent or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of a data container class for product details with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
