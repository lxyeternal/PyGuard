  "purpose": "A simple data container class for product information with no malicious or security issues.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in __init__ method (title, image, price, description).",
  "sinks": "None; no external data flows or untrusted data handling beyond input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to attributes; no external or untrusted data flow to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with standard use of strip() and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic Product class with attributes initialized from input parameters after stripping whitespace. The __str__ method returns a tuple-like string of attributes. No network, file, or dynamic code execution present. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The reports correctly identify the code as benign with high confidence. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data container with no malicious or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
