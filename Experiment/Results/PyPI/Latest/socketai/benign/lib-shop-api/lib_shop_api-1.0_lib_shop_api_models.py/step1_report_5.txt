  "purpose": "Define a Product class for representing product details with string attributes",
  "sources": "Input parameters: title, image, price, description provided during object instantiation",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing leading to leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to instance variables after stripping whitespace",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with an initializer and string representation method. It processes input parameters by stripping whitespace, which is standard. There are no external data reads, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior. No sensitive data handling or insecure operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to serve a benign purpose of modeling product data. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
