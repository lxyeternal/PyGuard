  "purpose": "Define a Product class to encapsulate product details with string attributes and a string representation method.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the __init__ method: title, image, price, description.",
  "sinks": "String attributes assigned to instance variables; no external data sinks or output functions present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into object attributes, no further data processing or external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with an initializer that sanitizes input strings using strip() and a __str__ method for string representation. There are no external data flows, no network connections, no code injection points, and no malicious logic. The class appears to be a straightforward data container without security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic class definition for product data with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a simple data structure, and there is no indication of supply chain attacks or malicious code embedded.",
