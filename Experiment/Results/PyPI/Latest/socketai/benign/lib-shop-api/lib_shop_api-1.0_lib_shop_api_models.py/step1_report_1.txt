  "purpose": "Define a Product class to encapsulate product information with initialization and string representation methods.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__ method: title, image, price, description",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to object attributes, and the __str__ method formats these attributes into a string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data container class with methods to initialize and represent product information. It does not perform any I/O, network activity, or suspicious operations. The use of strip() on inputs is safe and common. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign and implements a straightforward data model for products without any malicious intent or security issues.",
