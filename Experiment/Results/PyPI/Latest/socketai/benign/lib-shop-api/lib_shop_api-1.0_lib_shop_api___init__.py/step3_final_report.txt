{
  "purpose": "Standard package initialization, likely empty or containing minimal import statements.",
  "sources": "No data input, environment variables, or external data sources; only import statements if any.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no code execution or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the files contain no executable code or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no obfuscated patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The files are either empty or contain only minimal import statements typical for __init__.py files. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or anomalies are present. The code is benign, with high confidence in the benign nature. No data flows, external interactions, or code execution paths are identified. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The __init__.py files are standard, benign package initializers with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify their benign nature, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
