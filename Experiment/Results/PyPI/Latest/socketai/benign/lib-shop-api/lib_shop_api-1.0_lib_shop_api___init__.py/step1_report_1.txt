  "anomalies": "File contains only an empty __init__.py, which is normal for package initialization; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The __init__.py file is empty, serving as a standard package initializer. There are no code statements, no data reads, no data writes, and no suspicious constructs. Since it is common for __init__.py files to be empty or contain minimal code, this file does not introduce any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a standard package initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
