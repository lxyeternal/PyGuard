  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'lib_shop_api' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded package name, version, dependencies, description, author info, URL",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external data output",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static setup configuration with predefined values",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script defining package metadata and dependencies. It uses static, hardcoded values for package information, dependencies, and author details. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious imports, or suspicious behavior. No data is being read from or written to external sources dynamically; the script simply provides package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate, standard configuration for packaging a Python project. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or security risks within this code.",
