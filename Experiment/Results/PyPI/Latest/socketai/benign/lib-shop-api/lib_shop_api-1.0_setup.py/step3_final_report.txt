{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package, defining metadata and dependencies without any dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata and dependency lists within the setup() function",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks; static configuration only",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no data flow or dynamic execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with hardcoded package information, dependencies, and author details. There are no runtime behaviors, user inputs, external data processing, or obfuscation. Dependencies are common packages used in web scraping or automation, with no signs of malicious intent. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are correctly set to 0, reflecting the benign and static nature of the script. The confidence score is 1, indicating full certainty in this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
