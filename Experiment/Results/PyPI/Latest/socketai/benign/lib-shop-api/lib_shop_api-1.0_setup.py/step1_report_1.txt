  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with standard use of setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, calls setup() with predefined package metadata, dependencies, and project info. There are no inputs, environment variable manipulations, or dynamic behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. The dependencies listed are common Python packages, and the code serves as a standard package setup script without any obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears safe and standard.",
