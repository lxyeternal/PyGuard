  "purpose": "Configure and prepare the Python package 'lib_shop_api' for distribution, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function: package name, version, dependencies, description, author info, and URL.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted input or data sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup parameters are static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard setup configuration with no unusual or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. All data appears to be static, hardcoded strings with no input handling, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code components. It does not contain any runtime logic or external data processing beyond package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign setup configuration script with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
