  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'lib_shop_api' Python library.",
  "sources": "The script reads package configuration data such as package name, version, dependencies, description, author info, and URL.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or user input; the script primarily defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining package metadata and dependencies for setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. All dependencies are standard, and no malicious behavior is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools for package configuration. It specifies dependencies (requests, beautifulsoup4, fake_useragent), package metadata, and project URL. No user input, untrusted data, or suspicious behavior is present. The dependencies are common and benign, and the script does not perform any runtime operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
