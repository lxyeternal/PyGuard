{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'lib_shop_api', specifying its metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from static strings and lists in the setup() call, including package name, version, dependencies, description, author details, and URL.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the code does not execute or evaluate external inputs at runtime.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow exists; the configuration uses static data for package setup, with no input processing or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors; all code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with static package metadata and dependencies. There is no dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity. The dependencies listed are common and benign. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard Python package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain security issues, or obfuscation. It appears safe and legitimate.",
