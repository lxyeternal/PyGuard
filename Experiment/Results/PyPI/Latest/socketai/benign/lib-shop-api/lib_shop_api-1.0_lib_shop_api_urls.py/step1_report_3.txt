{
  "purpose": "Defines a dictionary of URLs for various product categories, likely used for product referencing or linking within an application.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'lib_shop_api.constants' and uses constant identifiers as dictionary keys.",
  "sinks": "The URL strings themselves are static, but if these constants are manipulated or influenced externally, they could serve as data sinks.",
  "flows": "Constant identifiers are mapped directly to URLs; no dynamic or user-influenced data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports all constants with '*', which could include unintended constants or variables. Many category URLs are commented out, indicating potential for future or conditional use but not suspicious in itself. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are visible. No obfuscation or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants and assigns static URL strings to a dictionary, with no dynamic input, user interaction, or network activity. The URLs appear legitimate and descriptive. The use of wildcard import is a slight concern for namespace pollution but does not directly indicate malicious intent. No signs of data leakage, malicious behavior, or sabotage are evident. Commented-out categories suggest incomplete or optional data but do not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward URL mapping for product categories, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
