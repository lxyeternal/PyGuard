  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes that the code is benign, static configuration with no malicious intent. It notes the wildcard import as a potential concern but doesn't see malicious behavior.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate; risk score 0.1 is reasonable given the wildcard import, which could hide secrets if the imported module contains sensitive data, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Overall:** The reasoning is sound. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** The report finds the code to be straightforward static data assignment with no suspicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, obfuscated 0. The URL prefix is static and benign.\n- **Overall:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, noting static URL mapping, no dynamic input, no malicious code.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1, obfuscated 0. No suspicious activity.\n- **Overall:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is static configuration, no malicious behavior.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1, obfuscated 0. No issues.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—static URL constants, no malicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0, obfuscated 0.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static configuration with no malicious behavior.\n- The use of wildcard import (`from lib_shop_api.constants import *`) is a minor concern but not indicative of malicious intent; it could potentially hide secrets if the imported module contains sensitive data, but there's no evidence here.\n- The URLs are hardcoded and appear benign.\n- No obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- Malware scores are all correctly set to 0.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting minimal concern based on the static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to wildcard import concern but not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are consistent with the analysis. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to wildcard import, but overall very low risk)\n\nThis code is a benign static configuration module with no security issues.",
