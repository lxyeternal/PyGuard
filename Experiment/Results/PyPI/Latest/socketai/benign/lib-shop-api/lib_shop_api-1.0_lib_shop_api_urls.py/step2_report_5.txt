  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is static, defining URL constants imported from an external module, with no dynamic or untrusted input. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The wildcard import `from lib_shop_api.constants import *` can obscure the origin of constants, potentially importing sensitive or unintended values, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — reasonable given the static nature. Slightly cautious but acceptable.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malware or malicious intent. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to Report 1, purely static configuration.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Same concern about wildcard import, but nothing malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues, safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Static URL mapping with constants.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Same import pattern; no dynamic or untrusted data.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Static URL definitions, no dynamic code.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Same pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Static configuration, no dynamic or untrusted data.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Commented-out code is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, reflecting minimal concern about wildcard imports or static URLs, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The code appears to be a straightforward static configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The use of wildcard import warrants caution but does not constitute a security risk by itself.\n- No changes needed to the scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to wildcard import concern, but not a serious risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign static configuration data with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.",
