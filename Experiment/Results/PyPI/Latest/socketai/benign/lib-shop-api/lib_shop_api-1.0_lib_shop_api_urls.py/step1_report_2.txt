  "purpose": "Define a dictionary of URL constants for various product categories and a URL prefix for images.",
  "sources": "Import statement for constants, and the URLS dictionary defining category URLs.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external calls; only static data assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of constants appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants from a module, then defines a dictionary 'URLS' mapping category identifiers to URLs. No dynamic code execution, no user input, no network calls, no obfuscated code, no secrets or backdoors. The URL prefix is also statically defined. Overall, the code is straightforward static configuration with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign static configuration defining category URLs and an image URL prefix. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this snippet.",
