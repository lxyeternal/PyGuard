{
  "purpose": "Define a dictionary of URLs for various product categories in an online shop, with constants imported from another module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from lib_shop_api.constants, and the URLS dictionary containing string values and constants.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the URLs are static and hardcoded, used for reference or display.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow or user input processing; the code simply assigns static URL strings to constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. All URLs are static strings. Commented-out code is present but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants and defines a dictionary mapping category labels to URLs. There is no dynamic execution, input handling, or data processing. The URLs are static, pointing to a known website. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The only notable aspect is the presence of commented-out code, which appears to be inactive, benign, and unrelated to malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static configuration mapping product categories to URLs. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The presence of commented-out code does not affect security. Overall, the code appears safe.",
