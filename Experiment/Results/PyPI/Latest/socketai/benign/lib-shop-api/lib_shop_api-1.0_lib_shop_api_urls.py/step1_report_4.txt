{
  "purpose": "Define a dictionary of URL constants for various product categories in an online store.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'lib_shop_api.constants', the URLS dictionary definition, and URL_PREFIX_IMAGE string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only assigns static URLs to constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only initializes constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code. The URLs are hardcoded but benign. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants from a library, then defines a dictionary of URL mappings for different product categories, using string keys and URLs as values. These URLs are static, hardcoded, and serve as constants for the application. There is no indication of external input, user data processing, or dynamic URL generation. The only potential concern is the hardcoded URLs, which are not inherently malicious but should be verified to ensure they point to legitimate resources. The URL_PREFIX_IMAGE is also a static URL string used for image references, with no dynamic or sensitive data involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static configuration of URLs for an online shop, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be safe and benign.",
