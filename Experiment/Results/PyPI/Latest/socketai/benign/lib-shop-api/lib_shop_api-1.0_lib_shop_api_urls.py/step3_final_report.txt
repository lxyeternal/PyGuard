{
  "purpose": "Define URL constants for various product categories and related resources, used for referencing product links and images within the application.",
  "sources": "Import from 'lib_shop_api.constants' module, specifically constants used as keys in URL mappings.",
  "sinks": "Static assignment of URL strings; no untrusted data sources or external inputs are used.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static constants are assigned directly to variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') from 'lib_shop_api.constants' could obscure the origin of constants but does not introduce malicious behavior. Commented-out code is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module defining URL mappings and a URL prefix. It imports constants via a wildcard import, which can be a style concern but not a security issue. URLs point to legitimate resources and are hardcoded, with no dynamic code execution, no user input handling, and no network calls. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low risk score (around 0.1) assigned in the reports is justified given the static, benign nature of the code. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and obfuscation is absent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned across the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
