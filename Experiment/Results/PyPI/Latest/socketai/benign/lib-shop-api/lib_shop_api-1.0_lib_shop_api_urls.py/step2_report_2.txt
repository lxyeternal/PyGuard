  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines URL constants for product categories.\n- Source: Import from 'lib_shop_api.constants' with *, no external untrusted input.\n- Sink: Static data, no data flow from untrusted sources.\n- Anomalies: Wildcard import could obscure origin, but not malicious.\n- Analysis: No dynamic code, secrets, or malicious indicators.\n- Conclusion: Benign static configuration.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious activity detected. The risk score is appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar static URL mapping.\n- Source: Same as above, static data.\n- Sink: No external data or dynamic code.\n- Anomalies: Use of wildcard import, but no malicious implications.\n- Analysis: Straightforward static data, benign URLs.\n- Conclusion: Safe static configuration.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Well justified. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: URL constants for product referencing.\n- Source: Import from constants module.\n- Sink: Static URLs.\n- Anomalies: Wildcard import, but not malicious.\n- Analysis: No dynamic or malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Safe static mapping.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasoning is consistent. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: URL constants for online store.\n- Source: Import and static URL definitions.\n- Sink: Static data.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies detected.\n- Analysis: No dynamic code, no secrets.\n- Conclusion: Benign static configuration.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: URL mapping for product categories.\n- Source: Import from constants, static URLs.\n- Sink: Static data.\n- Anomalies: Commented-out code, but benign.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe static config.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identified as safe.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0 or 0.1), appropriate given the static configuration and lack of dynamic or sensitive data.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The wildcard import from 'lib_shop_api.constants' is a minor concern for namespace pollution but not malicious.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- URLs are hardcoded and appear legitimate.\n- No external untrusted data or code execution.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n- The overall security posture of this code fragment is benign.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to wildcard import and static URLs, but minimal)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a straightforward static configuration with no security issues. The reports' assessments are accurate.",
