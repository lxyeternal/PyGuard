  "conclusion": "The code is a benign file transfer utility with security weaknesses due to predictable secret code generation and unencrypted data transfer. It does not exhibit malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score could be slightly increased to around 0.6 considering the security flaws, but overall, it remains low. The code's primary concern is security, not malicious intent."
