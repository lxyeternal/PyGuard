  "purpose": "CLI tool for generating a secret code, starting a TCP server for trusted device connections, and facilitating file transfer commands with authentication.",
  "sources": "Reading the secret code from a hidden file, receiving commands over socket, reading files for upload, user input for client commands.",
  "sinks": "Sending responses over socket, writing uploaded files to disk, printing logs and prompts.",
  "flows": "Secret code loaded from file -> client/server authentication -> command received over socket -> file read/write or directory listing -> response sent back.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'random.randint()' for secret code generation, plaintext socket communication without encryption, minimal input validation, no sanitization of filenames.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic client-server file transfer system with shared secret authentication stored in a file. It uses plaintext socket communication with base64 encoding for file transfer, which is insecure. The secret code is generated with 'random.randint()', which is not cryptographically secure. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The security weaknesses are acknowledged but do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, as no malicious payloads or behaviors are detected. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward. The security risk score is approximately 0.3, reflecting security flaws but no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, functional file transfer utility with security weaknesses such as insecure secret generation and plaintext data transfer. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary; the code is benign but insecure.",
