  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, functional file transfer utility with security weaknesses such as insecure secret generation and plaintext data transfer. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary; the code is benign but insecure."
