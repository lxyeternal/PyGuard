  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a typical, benign package configuration with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only minor risk pertains to the CLI entry point, which could execute arbitrary code depending on its implementation. Given the lack of evidence, the overall security risk is very low. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code."
