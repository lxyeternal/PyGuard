  "purpose": "The code imports a class named BlackSpammerBD from a local module named core, likely related to spam or malicious messaging functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from .core",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are explicitly shown in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are visible from the given code",
  "anomalies": "The class name 'BlackSpammerBD' suggests potentially malicious intent, but it is only an import statement without implementation details",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a module import from a relative path. The class name implies functionality related to spam or malicious activity, but no actual behavior or code logic is present in this snippet. There are no signs of data handling, input/output operations, or other suspicious behaviors in this fragment. Without additional context or implementation details, it is impossible to assess maliciousness or security risks based solely on this import statement.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a simple import statement; the class name raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this limited code fragment.",
