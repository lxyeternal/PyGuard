  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "Import statement only; no data flow or execution flow evident",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple import statement with a relative path",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement that imports the class BlackSpammerBD from a sibling module core. There is no additional logic, data processing, or network activity present. Since this is a minimal code snippet, it does not provide any evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues. The only concern could be if the core module itself is malicious, but that cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard import statement typical of Python projects.",
