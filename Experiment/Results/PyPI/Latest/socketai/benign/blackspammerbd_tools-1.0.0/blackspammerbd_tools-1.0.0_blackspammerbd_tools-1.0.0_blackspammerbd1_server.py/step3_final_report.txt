{
  "purpose": "Provides a simple Flask server for file listing, uploading, and downloading without authentication or validation, potentially exploitable if exposed publicly.",
  "sources": "request JSON payloads for connection_code, item names, and base64-encoded data; URL parameters for item names.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem operations such as os.listdir, open, and write based on user input, with no sanitization or validation.",
  "flows": "Input data from request JSON or URL parameters flows directly into filesystem reads/writes, with minimal validation (connection_code length).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code; potential directory traversal risk due to unsanitized filenames; lack of access control.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward file management endpoints with minimal validation, allowing arbitrary file access. No malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is the absence of authentication and input sanitization, which could be exploited maliciously. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate low likelihood of malicious intent but high potential for misuse if exposed publicly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, unprotected file server with no malware or obfuscation. The primary risk stems from its open design, which could be exploited for malicious purposes. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is approximately 0.75, reflecting high potential for misuse due to lack of access controls.",
