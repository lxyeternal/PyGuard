  "purpose": "CLI tool for generating, verifying, listing, encoding, and decoding files with no clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments, reading and writing files ('connection_code.txt', target files, base64 files).",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations (including base64 encoding/decoding), console output, code generation.",
  "flows": "User inputs command → command parameters read from argv → file operations (reading/writing) based on commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code, standard use of libraries. Use of random for code generation is benign here.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages simple file operations and a basic connection code mechanism. It generates an 8-digit numeric code, verifies it, lists directory contents, encodes files in base64, and decodes base64 files. All operations are directly triggered via CLI commands and involve standard Python modules. No network communication, no credential theft, no data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present. The code does not perform any suspicious activities, nor does it manipulate or execute untrusted data beyond base64 encoding/decoding, which is a benign operation. The use of random for code generation is straightforward and not malicious. The script appears to be a utility with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility for file and code management with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It handles files and command-line inputs safely without suspicious behavior.",
