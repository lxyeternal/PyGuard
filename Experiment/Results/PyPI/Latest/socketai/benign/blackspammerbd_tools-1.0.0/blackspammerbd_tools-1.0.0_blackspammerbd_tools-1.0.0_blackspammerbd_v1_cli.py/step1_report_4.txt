  "purpose": "A CLI tool for generating, verifying, listing, encoding, and decoding files and connection codes, possibly for remote connection or file management.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem ('connection_code.txt', files to encode/decode), command-line arguments (subcommands and parameters).",
  "sinks": "File writing (connection_code.txt, encoded/decoded files), printing to console, potentially reading untrusted input (file contents for encoding/decoding).",
  "flows": "User provides commands and parameters -> code reads files or generates data -> outputs are written to files or printed. No external network communication or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random module for connection code; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code; no network activity; straightforward encoding/decoding functions; standard use of libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that manages connection codes and handles file encoding/decoding with base64. It uses standard libraries and common practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. No external network communication or obfuscated behavior. The connection code is generated with 'random', which is suitable for simple identification purposes but not cryptographically secure. The functions perform basic file operations with proper error handling. Overall, the code appears benign, with no indications of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI tool for managing connection codes and file encoding/decoding. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or malicious payloads.",
