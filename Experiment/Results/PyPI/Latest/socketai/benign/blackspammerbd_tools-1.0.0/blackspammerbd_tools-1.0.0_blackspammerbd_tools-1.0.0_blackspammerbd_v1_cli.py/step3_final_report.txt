  "purpose": "A CLI utility for generating, verifying connection codes, listing directory contents, and encoding/decoding files with base64.",
  "sources": "Reading user input (connection code), reading/writing files (connection_code.txt, target files), listing directory contents.",
  "sinks": "Writing connection code to file, reading connection code from file, reading and writing base64 encoded/decoded data.",
  "flows": "User provides code -> code compares with stored code -> success/failure message; File content read -> base64 encoded/decoded -> output file written.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of 'random.randint()' for code generation is predictable but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file operations, code generation, and verification without network activity or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the use of non-cryptographically secure random number generation for connection codes, which is predictable but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code is clear, with proper error handling, and uses standard libraries. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to the predictable code generation method.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The only minor issue is the use of 'random' for code generation, which could be improved with cryptographically secure methods if needed. Overall, it is safe for use with minimal security concerns.",
