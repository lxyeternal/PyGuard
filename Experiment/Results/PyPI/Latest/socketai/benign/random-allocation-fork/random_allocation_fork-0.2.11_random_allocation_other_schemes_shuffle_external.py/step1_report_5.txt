{
  "purpose": "The code implements privacy analysis functions for differential privacy, specifically for analyzing privacy guarantees of shuffled local reports using empirical and theoretical methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as n, epsorig, delta, and other parameters for calculations; it also reads data from statistical functions (e.g., stats.binom.cdf and pmf) and uses mathematical operations on these inputs.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks that handle untrusted external data, but it performs computations that could influence privacy parameters. No network or file output is present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in functions like deltacomp and binarysearch to compute privacy bounds, with data flow from inputs through statistical calculations to the output delta or epsilon bounds.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are evident. The code relies on well-known statistical libraries and standard math operations. No obfuscated or unusual language features are present. The use of statistical functions appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs privacy analysis using established mathematical and statistical methods, including binary search and binomial distribution calculations, to approximate privacy guarantees. All functions use standard libraries and perform transparent calculations. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is evident. The code is designed solely for privacy analysis in differential privacy contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a transparent implementation of differential privacy analysis methods, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It relies on standard statistical computations and mathematical functions for privacy parameter estimation. There are no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
