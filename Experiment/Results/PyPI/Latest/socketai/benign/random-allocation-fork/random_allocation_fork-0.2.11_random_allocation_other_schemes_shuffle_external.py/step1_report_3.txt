{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for empirical and theoretical analysis of differential privacy guarantees in shuffling mechanisms, specifically calculating privacy parameters such as epsilon and delta.",
  "sources": "Inputs include function parameters, constants, and data read via function arguments; no external or untrusted data sources are explicitly read in the code.",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations and returns numerical results; it does not contain sinks that output untrusted data or sensitive information to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs through mathematical computations, such as binary search and probability calculations, without involving external untrusted data sources or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code performs standard mathematical and statistical operations. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements privacy analysis functions using standard mathematical and statistical libraries (scipy.stats, math, numpy). The functions perform binary search, binomial probability computations, and theoretical calculations for differential privacy guarantees. The logic follows established methods in privacy analysis, with no indications of malicious activities or obfuscation. The functions do not read or write external data sources or perform network operations. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to privacy guarantees, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of privacy analysis tools for differential privacy. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations. It performs mathematical computations as intended for privacy guarantees, with no evident security risks or malware indicators.",
