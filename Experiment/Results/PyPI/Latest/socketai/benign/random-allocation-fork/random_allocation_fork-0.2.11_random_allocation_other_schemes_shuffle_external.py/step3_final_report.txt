{
  "purpose": "The code implements empirical and theoretical analyses for differential privacy guarantees, specifically for shuffling mechanisms, using statistical functions and binary search algorithms to estimate privacy parameters such as epsilon and delta.",
  "sources": "Reads input data through parameters passed to functions; uses standard libraries (scipy.stats, math, numpy) for calculations; no external data or user input during execution.",
  "sinks": "No external data outputs, network communication, or file I/O; results are returned as function outputs without side effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., c, eps, eps0, n, delta) flow into functions like deltacomp and binarysearch, which perform calculations and return privacy bounds; no external or untrusted data flows or system modifications occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward, well-commented, and relies solely on standard scientific libraries; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical divergence calculations and binary searches to estimate privacy parameters in differential privacy analysis. It uses standard libraries and mathematical functions without external data or network activity. The functions are transparent, with clear comments, and implement established mathematical procedures. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation for privacy analysis, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the code can be considered safe for its intended analytical purpose.",
