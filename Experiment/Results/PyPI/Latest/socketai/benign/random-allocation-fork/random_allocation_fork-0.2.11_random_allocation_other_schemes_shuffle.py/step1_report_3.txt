{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compute differential privacy parameters (epsilon and delta) for a shuffle-based privacy mechanism, using local epsilon calculations and numerical analysis.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: sigma, delta, epsilon, num_steps, num_selected, num_epochs, step; imported functions: local_epsilon, bin_search, numericalanalysis.",
  "sinks": "The code calls numericalanalysis and bin_search functions, which may internally perform computations; no direct untrusted data output or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sigma, delta, epsilon, etc.) flow into local_epsilon and numericalanalysis functions; shuffle_delta_analytic uses binary search with a lambda that calls shuffle_epsilon_analytic; internal loops modify epsilon and delta values based on calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated features are present. The code appears to perform standard mathematical calculations related to differential privacy. No hidden or malicious logic identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions to compute privacy parameters for a shuffle mechanism. It relies on external modules for numerical calculations and binary search. No network calls, file I/O, or hidden behaviors are present. The code's structure and variables are consistent with standard differential privacy calculations. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of differential privacy parameter calculations. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The use of external functions is appropriate for privacy analysis. Overall, it seems safe and well-structured.",
