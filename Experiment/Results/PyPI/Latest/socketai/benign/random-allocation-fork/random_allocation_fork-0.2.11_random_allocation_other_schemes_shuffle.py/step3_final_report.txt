  "purpose": "Compute differential privacy epsilon and delta bounds for a shuffle mechanism using external privacy analysis functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (sigma, delta, num_steps, num_selected, num_epochs, step); external functions local_epsilon, numericalanalysis, bin_search",
  "sinks": "No external data exfiltration or network activity; internal mathematical computations only",
  "flows": "External functions are called with parameters derived from input; no untrusted data flows outside the module",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard privacy parameter calculations, relying on external modules presumed to be benign. Validation checks ensure correct parameter ranges. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are present. External functions are critical points but are assumed safe based on context. The logic is straightforward and mathematically consistent with privacy analysis routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for privacy analysis with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. External dependencies are the only potential risk points but are not evidenced here. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
