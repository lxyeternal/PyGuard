  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines constants, data structures, and mappings for privacy schemes and their features. It imports functions from domain-specific modules, uses a data class for method features, and provides a utility to retrieve features.\n\n- **Security & Malware Assessment:** No suspicious activity, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The only dynamic aspect is attribute access via `getattr`, which is from known, predefined classes.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, well-structured, domain-specific configuration code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing configuration, constants, and safe attribute access. No external data flows or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Security & Malware Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only concern could be the dynamic attribute access, but it's from controlled, known classes.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.1 (very low), Obfuscated: 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate configuration code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—constants, data classes, static mappings, no dynamic code execution or external data handling.\n\n- **Security & Malware Assessment:** No malicious indicators, no obfuscation, no suspicious logic.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Clearly benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Configuration for privacy schemes, imports from known modules, no untrusted data or malicious activity.\n\n- **Security & Malware Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; code is for setup and configuration.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—configuration, constants, safe attribute access, no external data leaks or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Security & Malware Assessment:** No malicious indicators.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is primarily configuration, constants, data structures, and safe attribute access for privacy schemes and methods.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None of the reports find any malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n\n- **Security Risks:** Very low, consistent with benign configuration code.\n\n- **Flow & Logic:** No external data flows, network operations, or dynamic code execution beyond controlled attribute access.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious code or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — overall security risk is negligible; the code is a safe configuration module.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** Based on the detailed reviews, the code is a standard, well-structured configuration and utility module for privacy schemes, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score.",
