{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants, data structures, and mappings for different privacy-preserving schemes, methods, and their features used in a larger analysis or visualization system.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from multiple modules (local, poisson, shuffle, allocation schemes) that are used as epsilon and delta calculators, and reads constants, class definitions, and method mappings defined within the file.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects. The only potential issue is the dynamic attribute access in get_features_for_methods, which relies on predefined method keys.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves method features via getattr from method definitions, which are then used for visualization or analysis purposes. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. All imported modules appear to be legitimate privacy schemes. The get_features_for_methods function accesses attributes dynamically but from known method definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of constant definitions, data class for method features, a dictionary mapping scheme names to their feature objects, and a helper function to retrieve specific features for given methods. No untrusted input handling, network operations, or suspicious behavior is present. The imports are from domain-specific modules related to privacy schemes, and no indication of obfuscation or malicious code exists.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of a privacy analysis or visualization tool, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It utilizes well-defined data structures and safe attribute access. Overall, it is a standard, safe configuration and utility module.",
