{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants, data structures, and mappings for privacy schemes and their features, serving as a configuration module within a privacy or differential privacy framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from domain-specific modules providing epsilon/delta calculators and functions for privacy schemes.",
  "sinks": "Static attribute access via 'getattr' from predefined classes; no external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; attribute access is from controlled, predefined classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup with constants, data classes, and mappings for privacy schemes. It imports known functions, uses static attribute access, and contains no external data handling or network activity. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The use of 'getattr' is from controlled classes, minimizing risk. Overall, the code is benign and intended for configuration purposes within a privacy system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
