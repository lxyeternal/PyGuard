{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures, constants, and functions for managing and visualizing various differential privacy methods and schemes, including their features and configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily from imported modules and constants defined within the same file, such as method names, feature configurations, and parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input data; the code mainly uses predefined constants, functions, and class instances.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows indicative of malicious data manipulation; the code predominantly sets up configurations and mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic behaviors are present. The code does import several modules related to privacy schemes but does not invoke network functions, system commands, or handle sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up constants, enumerations, and data classes for privacy schemes and their features, including various differential privacy mechanisms. It imports multiple functions related to epsilon and delta calculations from other modules, which appear to be standard for privacy computations. The functions and data structures are used for configuration and visualization, with no signs of data handling from untrusted sources or executing potentially malicious code. The imports and definitions do not perform any network, file, or system operations that could be malicious. The only external dependencies are privacy-related modules, which are assumed to be legitimate. There are no indications of backdoors, hidden functions, or malicious code snippets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration and utility module for privacy schemes and visualization, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It primarily defines data structures, constants, and functions to support privacy method management. The code appears benign and consistent with standard practices for such setups.",
