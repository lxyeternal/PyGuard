  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines constants, data structures, and mappings for privacy schemes. It imports functions from domain-specific modules that are used as epsilon/delta calculators. No suspicious or malicious code is evident.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; attribute access via `getattr` is from predefined classes.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard configuration module for privacy schemes, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. The overall assessment aligns with a benign, safe code snippet.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on managing privacy schemes. No untrusted data processing or network operations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Static attribute access, no data exfiltration or dynamic code execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a benign configuration utility for privacy methods, with high confidence of safety.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1 (slightly above zero, but justified given the nature of imported modules), Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious intent or suspicious activity. The small security risk score is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Configuration for privacy schemes, no untrusted data handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Static data access, no external data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard setup code, benign, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines constants and imports functions from privacy modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clear, standard configuration code, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others—configuration for privacy schemes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, benign code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports indicate that the code is purely configuration, constants, and utility functions for managing privacy schemes. No evidence of malicious code, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation & Malware:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low, with minor justified concerns about imported modules, but nothing malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious code or behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)  \n**Risk Score:** **0.1** (minimal, justified by the use of imported modules, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The use of `getattr` is safe here because it accesses predefined class attributes, not dynamic or user-controlled data.  \n- The code appears to be part of a legitimate privacy framework, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and intended for configuration purposes within a privacy or differential privacy system. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
