{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to perform and visualize experiments involving data calculation and plotting, primarily in a data analysis or research context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, configuration dictionaries, and existing CSV files; it also reads and inspects functions and modules for caching and metadata.",
  "sinks": "Data is saved to CSV files and plots are saved as PNG images; functions like pd.read_csv, plt.savefig, and os.path.exists are used as sinks for output data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from parameters and existing files into calculations; results flow into saved files and plots; cache clearing flows are invoked before experiments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Cache clearing functions are comprehensive but typical. No obfuscated code, unusual data flows, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured for conducting experiments, managing data storage, and visualization, with functions for matching arguments, retrieving variable names, and handling caching. All data input/output operations utilize standard libraries like os, pandas, and matplotlib. The functions that save data and plots are straightforward, and the code manages existing files with typical existence checks. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or stealth behaviors are present. The cache clearing is standard for performance optimization and does not appear malicious. Overall, the code appears to be for scientific or data analysis purposes without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate experimental data management and visualization module with no indicators of malicious or sabotage behaviors. It safely handles data input/output, visualization, and cache management without suspicious activities.",
