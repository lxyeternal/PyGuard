{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for running and managing data analysis experiments, including data calculation, saving, and visualization.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration and parameter data from dictionaries, CSV files, and the filesystem. It also accesses function signatures and cache states.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include reading/writing CSV files, saving plots, and clearing caches. No evident direct untrusted data execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (params_dict, config_dict, CSV files) into calculations via functions like calc_experiment_data. Results are then optionally saved or visualized, with data flow ending at file I/O or plotting.",
  "anomalies": "The code clears caches across multiple modules, which could be used maliciously to evade detection or disrupt behavior if caches store sensitive data. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious variable names observed. Plotting functions are standard. No obfuscated or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard experiment data processing: parameter handling, function argument matching, data computation, and visualization. Cache clearing across modules could be misused to hide malicious behavior or tamper with data, but in a benign context it aids in ensuring fresh computations. No signs of malicious network activity, reverse shells, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Files and data are handled locally, with no untrusted data being executed. Functions are well-structured; no evidence of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data processing and visualization utility with no evident malicious intent. The cache clearing step warrants scrutiny but is not inherently malicious. Overall, the code does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks.",
