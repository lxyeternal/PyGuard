{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for conducting parameterized experiments, calculating data using various functions, and visualizing and saving the results, primarily for analysis of random allocation schemes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from parameters (params_dict, config_dict), external modules, and existing CSV files when not recalculating data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe sinks include file writing (saving CSV and plot images), which could be exploited if inputs are maliciously crafted. No other significant sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters or external files into calculation functions, then into storage (CSV) or visualization outputs; no external network communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. Cache clearing, data saving, and plotting are standard operations. The code uses standard libraries and calls functions from imported modules, which appear benign.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles parameter management, data calculation, and visualization with standard Python libraries and imported modules. All file operations are standard and controlled, with no indications of malicious data exfiltration or harmful activities. There are no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated or dynamic code execution, and no network activity. The functions operate on expected inputs, and their behavior aligns with legitimate data analysis workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard scientific/analytical script for conducting experiments, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It handles data reading, calculation, and visualization securely, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
