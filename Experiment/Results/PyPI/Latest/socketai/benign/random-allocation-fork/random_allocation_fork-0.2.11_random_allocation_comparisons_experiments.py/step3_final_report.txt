{
  "purpose": "The code performs data analysis, experiment management, caching, and visualization for scientific workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads parameters, configuration dictionaries, and external modules; accesses files for CSV and plot saving.",
  "sinks": "Outputs CSV files, plots (PNG), and console logs; no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and configurations flow into data calculation functions; results are saved or visualized accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Cache clearing is routine.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard data processing and visualization practices. Cache clearing across modules is typical for ensuring fresh computations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The data flow is transparent, with local file I/O and no network activity. The cache clearing, while potentially misused, is a common practice and not inherently malicious in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The minimal security risk stems from cache clearing, which is standard but should be monitored in a malicious context. Overall, the security scores are appropriate.",
