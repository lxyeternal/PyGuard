{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate various plots and tables for comparison and combined data visualization, primarily using matplotlib and pandas, based on input datasets.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'data' dictionary, particularly from 'y data' and 'x data' keys, and imports features from external modules. No user input or external untrusted sources are explicitly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "The code calls matplotlib functions to generate visual outputs; these are benign and typical for plotting. No external network connections, file writing, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'data' dictionary into plotting functions, where it is used to generate figures and tables. No untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to command execution or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. The code uses standard plotting libraries and straightforward data handling. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. No obfuscated or dynamically executed code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple plotting functions that generate figures and tables from provided datasets. It uses standard libraries (matplotlib, numpy, pandas) and external features (via imported functions and dictionaries) without manipulating external inputs. No network operations, file I/O, or system commands are present. The code performs typical data visualization tasks with clear, transparent logic. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data visualization utility without malicious intent or suspicious activity. It strictly adheres to expected behaviors for plotting and data handling, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
