{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for plotting comparison graphs and tables related to differential privacy parameters, using matplotlib, pandas, and numpy, with external helper functions for feature extraction.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'data' dictionary, specifically 'x data', 'y data', and associated labels; external functions like 'get_features_for_methods' and constants such as 'names_dict' provide feature mappings.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs matplotlib figures and pandas DataFrames; no external data sinks, network communication, or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'data' dictionary into plotting functions, with feature mappings applied; filtered data is plotted with labels, colors, and markers; no external data is modified or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; external dependencies are assumed benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward visualization logic, utilizing standard libraries and external helper functions for feature extraction. It filters method keys, formats axes, and plots data with labels and styles. No network, file, or dynamic code execution is involved. External functions and constants are typical for modular plotting routines. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The code's structure and purpose are transparent, and the scoring aligns with its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data visualization module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. External dependencies are assumed safe, and the code's logic is straightforward. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score are justified and appropriate.",
