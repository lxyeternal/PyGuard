  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward visualization module for plotting comparison data related to differential privacy parameters. It relies on external functions (`get_features_for_methods`) and constants (`names_dict`, `EPSILON`, `DELTA`), but no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code performs standard plotting, filtering, and data handling.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis. No obfuscation or malware detected.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated at 0.2, but justified given external dependencies, which are assumed benign.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, this code is for plotting comparison graphs and tables, using standard libraries and external functions/constants. No suspicious patterns, network activity, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Scores are 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0, justified as no external threats are evident.\n\n- **Confidence:** 1, high certainty.\n\n**Assessment:** Clear benign visualization code, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code provides visualization functions for plotting data, with no signs of malicious activity. It uses standard libraries and external functions, but nothing suspicious.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Scores are 0, matching the benign nature.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Confidence:** 1, high certainty.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard plotting functions, no external threats, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0, aligned with benign assessment.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1, very low, justified by reliance on external functions.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a typical visualization utility with no signs of malicious activity. It uses standard libraries and external functions for features, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0, consistent.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0, justified.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports describe code that is purely for data visualization, with no network, file I/O, or external command execution. The functions rely on external modules and constants, but these are assumed benign.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are 0, which is consistent with the analysis. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Very low across all reports, with minor justified concerns due to external dependencies, but nothing indicating malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** The scores are reasonable. The malware scores are 0 because no malicious activity is present. Obfuscated scores are 0 because the code is straightforward and not obfuscated. Security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, justified by external dependencies, but no actual threat.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign data visualization module with no malicious or suspicious features. The current scores are appropriate.",
