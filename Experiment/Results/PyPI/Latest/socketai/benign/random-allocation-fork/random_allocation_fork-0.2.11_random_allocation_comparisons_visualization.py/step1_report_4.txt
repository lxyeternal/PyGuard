{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate comparison plots, table representations, and combined data visualizations based on input data, primarily for analyzing experimental or comparison results.",
  "sources": "Input data parameters such as 'data', 'log_x_axis', 'log_y_axis', and formatting functions; access to 'data['y data']', 'data['x data']', 'data['x name']', 'data['y name']'.",
  "sinks": "Plotting functions call matplotlib's plotting APIs, which handle rendering visual output. No direct data sinks like network calls or file writes are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into plotting functions; data['y data'] and data['x data'] are used as sources; matplotlib functions are used to generate visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are observed. The code uses standard plotting and data manipulation libraries without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple plotting functions that generate figures or tables based on supplied data structures. It utilizes standard libraries like matplotlib, numpy, and pandas, with no external or network interactions. Functions like 'get_features_for_methods' and dictionaries such as 'names_dict' are invoked, presumably from imported modules, but they do not exhibit malicious behavior. The code processes data for visualization only, with no evidence of data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden functionalities. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. The functions perform data filtering, scaling, and plotting in a typical manner, adhering to standard data visualization practices.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a standard visualization utility for plotting comparison data and tables. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malware indicators. The code relies on common libraries and straightforward data processing, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
