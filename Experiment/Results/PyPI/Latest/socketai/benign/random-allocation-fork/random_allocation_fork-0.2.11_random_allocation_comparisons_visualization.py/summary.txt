  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data visualization module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. External dependencies are assumed safe, and the code's logic is straightforward. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score are justified and appropriate."
