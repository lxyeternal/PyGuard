  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- **Reports 1-5**: All describe the code as straightforward data visualization functions for plotting comparison graphs and tables using matplotlib, pandas, and numpy. They mention reliance on external functions like `get_features_for_methods` and dictionaries such as `names_dict`, but emphasize that these are benign and standard in data visualization contexts.\n\n- **Security indicators**: All reports assign very low malware scores (0 or 0.1), and minimal security risks (mostly 0 or 0.1). Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or above), indicating that the reviewers see no malicious intent.\n\n- **Anomalies or suspicious features**: None of the reports identify anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or other malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?**  \n  No. The code is purely for plotting and data presentation, with no network, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. The functions are standard visualization routines.\n\n- **External dependencies?**  \n  The code depends on imported functions and constants (`get_features_for_methods`, `names_dict`, various `ALLOCATION_*` constants). These are external but are typical in modular codebases and do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n- **Obfuscation or malware?**  \n  No. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses common libraries.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions?**  \n  The code assumes that external functions and constants are benign. If these external modules were malicious, that could be a concern, but based on the reports, these are standard and presumed safe.\n\n---\n\n### Scores Justification:\n\n- **Malware score**:  \n  All reports assign 0 or very close to 0. Given the benign nature, **0** is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score**:  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code is not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk score**:  \n  Given the low malware and obfuscation scores, and the absence of any suspicious behavior, a risk score of **0.1** or **0.2** is reasonable. Some reports have assigned 0.1 or 0.2, which seems appropriate.\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **The code is a standard data visualization module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.**  \n- **No evidence of obfuscation, backdoors, or data exfiltration.**  \n- **External dependencies are typical and do not raise suspicion.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (to reflect minimal, non-security-related concerns, such as dependency trust)\n\n**Note:** If external modules (`get_features_for_methods`, `names_dict`, constants) are verified to be benign, then these scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                   | No malicious activity detected                               |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                   | Code is clear, not obfuscated                                |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1                 | Very low, mainly related to external dependencies, which are assumed benign |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, benign, and suitable for use in production or research environments.",
