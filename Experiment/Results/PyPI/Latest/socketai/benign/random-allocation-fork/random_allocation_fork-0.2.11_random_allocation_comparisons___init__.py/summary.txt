  "malware_score": 0.5,
  "security_risk": 0.55,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The majority of reports are consistent with their assessments. Report 1 exhibits moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution signs, warranting a slight increase in malware score. Other reports correctly reflect benign or inert code. Minor score adjustments improve accuracy, but overall, the evaluations are appropriate."
