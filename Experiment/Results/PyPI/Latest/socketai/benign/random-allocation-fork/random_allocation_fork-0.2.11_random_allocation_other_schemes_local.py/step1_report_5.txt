  "purpose": "This code provides functions to compute privacy parameters for Gaussian mechanisms in differential privacy, including delta and epsilon calculations, using binary search and statistical functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data mainly from function parameters (sigma, epsilon, delta, num_selected, num_epochs). Uses scipy.stats.norm for probability calculations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input directly; calculations are deterministic based on parameters. No data leaks or external data transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into privacy calculations via Gaussian_delta and Gaussian_epsilon, which are then used in local_delta and local_epsilon. No external data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses functions with caching decorators commented out, which suggests potential optimization, but no anomalous or malicious code present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs mathematical calculations related to differential privacy, including binary search to invert functions and probability computations. No suspicious or malicious logic, no code injection, data leakage, or hidden functionalities. All functions are deterministic and related to privacy parameter estimation. No obfuscated or suspicious language features. Usage of third-party libraries appears appropriate for scientific computing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of differential privacy calculations without any malicious intent. It focuses on privacy metric computations and includes no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. The code is straightforward, with no anomalous or suspicious parts.",
