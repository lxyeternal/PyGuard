{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for calculating privacy guarantees of Gaussian mechanisms and local privacy parameters, likely for differential privacy applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as sigma, epsilon, delta, num_selected, and num_epochs. It also imports modules including numpy, scipy.stats, and dp_accounting.pld.",
  "sinks": "The functions return numerical privacy parameters; no sinks for untrusted data or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in functions to compute privacy metrics through mathematical operations and binary search, with no external data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Usage of known libraries is standard, and functions are straightforward mathematical computations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mathematical functions for differential privacy calculations using standard libraries. Functions for binary search, normal CDF/logCDF calculations, and privacy parameter estimations are implemented. All code appears consistent with privacy calculation tasks. No external system calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected. No suspicious logic or hidden behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of differential privacy calculations, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily performs mathematical computations for privacy parameters. No anomalies, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code are evident.",
