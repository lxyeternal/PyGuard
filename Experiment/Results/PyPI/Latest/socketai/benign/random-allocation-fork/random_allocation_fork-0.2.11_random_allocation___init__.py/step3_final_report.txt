{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface module that imports and re-exports functions, constants, and definitions related to differential privacy schemes, experiments, and visualization tools from the 'random_allocation' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules such as 'random_allocation.comparisons.experiments', 'visualization', 'definitions', and 'random_allocation_scheme'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows to external systems; the code does not handle untrusted input or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "The source-to-sink paths are nonexistent as the code only imports and exports symbols without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module that consolidates and exposes functions and constants related to differential privacy. It contains only import statements and an __all__ declaration, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. All imported modules appear to be standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The code's purpose is organizational, serving as an API surface for other components. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected. The security posture is benign, and the code is typical for a package's __init__.py or interface module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior. All signals and reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code content.",
