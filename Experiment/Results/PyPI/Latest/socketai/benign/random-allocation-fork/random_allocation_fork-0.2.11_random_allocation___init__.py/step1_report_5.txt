{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for differential privacy analysis tools, including importing functions for experiments, visualization, constants, and core allocation methods related to differential privacy schemes.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'random_allocation.comparisons' and 'random_allocation.random_allocation_scheme', as well as constants and functions related to allocation schemes and visualization.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data inputs or outputs, no network or file operations, and no handling of untrusted data streams.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports predefined functions and constants; there are no data flows involving external untrusted sources within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "This module mainly acts as an interface, importing specific functions and constants from a well-structured package related to differential privacy. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does not process untrusted input or perform network/file operations. It strictly defines an export list (__all__) for the package's API. The use of imports from internal modules is standard for Python packages. No anomalies or suspicious code segments are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module that exports specific functions and constants related to differential privacy analysis. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code snippet.",
