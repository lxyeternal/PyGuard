{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for differential privacy analysis tools, including functions for running experiments, plotting results, and constants for configurations.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'random_allocation' package modules, which likely read data or configuration settings internally when invoked.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are visible in this snippet; the code primarily imports functions and constants, which are then intended to be used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Not directly applicable here; no data flow from sources to sinks is evident in this static code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code consists of standard import statements and an __all__ export list. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple functions and constants from a package called 'random_allocation', which appears to implement differential privacy schemes. The structure is standard for a module that exposes selected functionalities for external use via __all__. No potentially malicious code or suspicious behaviors are present. All imports are from a known package, and there is no dynamic execution or evaluation. The purpose is clearly for privacy analysis and visualization, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward interface module that imports and exposes functions for differential privacy experiments and visualizations. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks in this static code segment.",
