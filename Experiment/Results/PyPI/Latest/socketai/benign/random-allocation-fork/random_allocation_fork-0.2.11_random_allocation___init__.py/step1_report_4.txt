{
  "purpose": "This module appears to serve as an interface for differential privacy analysis tools, providing imports and definitions for experiments, visualization, constants, and core functions related to random allocation schemes in differential privacy.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions and constants from the 'random_allocation' package modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or written. The code does not handle input/output directly.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports functions and constants; no data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is purely import and export declarations with no logic or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script only imports functions and constants from a well-structured package related to differential privacy. It then defines an __all__ list to specify exported symbols. No data manipulation, user input handling, network activity, or other typical malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward interface or module aggregation file.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity in this code. It functions solely as an import and export declaration for a differential privacy package module. No security risks or malware are evident.",
