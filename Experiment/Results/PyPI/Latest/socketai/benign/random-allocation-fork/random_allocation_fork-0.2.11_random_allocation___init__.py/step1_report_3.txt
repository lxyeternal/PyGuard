{
  "purpose": "This package provides tools for analyzing and comparing different random allocation schemes in the context of differential privacy.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions and constants from the 'random_allocation' module and submodules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no code execution based on untrusted input or external data. The code primarily imports modules and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exposes functions/constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various functions and constants from a 'random_allocation' package and defines an __all__ list for module exports. The code appears to be a standard module initialization, facilitating access to functions related to differential privacy analysis. No user input processing, network communication, or code execution based on untrusted data is present. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module export file, importing and exposing functions and constants from a 'random_allocation' package. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident. It appears to serve as a public interface for differential privacy tools.",
