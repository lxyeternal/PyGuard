  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code integrity, and the consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes functions for calculating PLD, epsilon, delta, and RDP for Poisson with Gaussian mechanisms. Parameters are standard and directly used.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Results are returned; no external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Commented cache decorators are typical optimization hints.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, focused on privacy calculations, using external standard libraries ('dp_accounting', 'rdp'). No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. Confidence: 1.0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully legitimate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions for privacy analysis, with explicit parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication, only internal calculations and optional debug prints.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation. Commented cache decorators are benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard privacy accounting code, relying on external libraries. No malicious activity or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.9 (slightly higher but still very low).\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious behavior; the slight security risk score might be due to general caution but is still very low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same focus, with detailed parameter documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; code is standard for privacy analysis.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, straightforward implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar privacy functions, with reliance on external modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate privacy analysis code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2 (slightly higher, possibly due to the print statements).\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious intent; print statements are benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others, focused on privacy calculations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard privacy accounting code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (up to 0.9), likely due to the presence of print statements or general caution, but no actual security issues are present.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — The code is a straightforward privacy accounting implementation.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — No obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Very low; mainly standard calculations with no external threats or malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The minor security risk scores reflect general caution rather than actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep the risk score low unless new evidence arises. The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.",
