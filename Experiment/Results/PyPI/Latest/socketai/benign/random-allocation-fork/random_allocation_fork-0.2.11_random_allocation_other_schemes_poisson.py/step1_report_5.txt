{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compute privacy loss distributions (PLD), delta, epsilon, and RDP accountant objects for differential privacy analysis using Poisson sampling with Gaussian mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dp_accounting' module and 'typing.List', functions taking parameters such as sigma, epsilon, delta, num_steps, num_epochs, sampling_prob, discretization, direction, alpha_orders.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'pld.privacy_loss_distribution' methods, 'rdp.RdpAccountant' methods, and 'print' statements. No direct data sinks or external network calls observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sigma, epsilon, delta, etc.) are used to generate privacy loss distributions or accountants, which then compute delta or epsilon via internal methods. 'print' outputs are only for debugging and do not affect data flow or security.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code performs standard DP calculations. The 'print' statements are for debugging but are not malicious. The code structure is straightforward with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for computing privacy parameters using established DP accounting methods, specifically PLD and RDP approaches. The functions utilize imported modules for privacy accounting without any apparent suspicious operations. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or backdoors are present. The code is primarily mathematical and procedural, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of privacy accounting techniques for differential privacy. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is a standard, well-structured implementation without obfuscation or hidden malicious logic.",
