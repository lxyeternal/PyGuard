  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, suspicious functions, obfuscation, and data flows.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., reading stdin, environment variables), imported libraries, external network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution functions.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (inputs/env) to sinks (network/file), potentially via dynamic execution or data manipulation functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval(), exec(), obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, unusual imports, or dynamic code generation; absence of these reduces suspicion.",
  "analysis": "Based on the summaries, all reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns. The code appears benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0 are appropriate. The security risk scores of 0.2 are conservative but acceptable, reflecting minimal baseline risk for scripts handling input and environment variables without malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious data flows are indicated. Without actual code snippets, these assessments are based on provided descriptions, which are consistent and reasonable.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately conservative. The code is unlikely to be malicious or obfuscated, with a low security risk. No adjustments are necessary unless actual code reveals hidden malicious behavior.",
