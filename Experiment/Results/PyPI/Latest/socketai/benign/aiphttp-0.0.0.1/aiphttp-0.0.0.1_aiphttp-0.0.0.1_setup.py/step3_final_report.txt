  "purpose": "A standard Python package setup script defining static metadata with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "No external input, environment variables, or data sources; static metadata fields in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external communication or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields, and an unconventional version number '0.0.0.1', but these are benign and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, input handling, or suspicious constructs. The empty author fields and version number are unusual but not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The malware score is appropriately 0; obfuscated is 0; the security risk score is slightly overestimated in one report at 0.1, but given the context, it remains very low. The confidence in these assessments is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no security risks or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate; the minor security risk score can be adjusted to 0 for consistency, but it does not affect the overall benign assessment.",
