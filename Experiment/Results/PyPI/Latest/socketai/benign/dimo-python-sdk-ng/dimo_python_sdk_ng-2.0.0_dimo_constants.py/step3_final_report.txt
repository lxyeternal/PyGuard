  "purpose": "Static configuration of environment-specific constants (NFT addresses and RPC URLs) for blockchain deployment.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded dictionary entries for 'NFT_address' and 'RPC_provider' in 'Production' and 'Dev' environments.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static dictionary defining environment-specific constants for blockchain addresses and RPC URLs. No dynamic code, input handling, or external data processing is present. The addresses and URLs are typical and publicly known. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (0.1), reflecting the exposure of public configuration data. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. The minimal security risk is due to exposure of public addresses and URLs, which is standard for configuration files.",
