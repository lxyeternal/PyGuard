{
  "purpose": "Store network configuration constants for different environments (Production and Development) related to NFT addresses and RPC providers.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded dictionary containing environment-specific data (NFT addresses and RPC URLs).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or transmit data, nor does it involve external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code simply defines a static data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and static with hardcoded values.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Python dictionary with two environments, each containing an NFT address and an RPC provider URL. No input handling, data processing, or external communication occurs. The hardcoded values are typical for configuration files. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or suspicious network addresses. The RPC URL points to a known provider, and the addresses are within typical Ethereum address formats.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple configuration setup with hardcoded network parameters. It shows no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe for use as a static configuration snippet.",
