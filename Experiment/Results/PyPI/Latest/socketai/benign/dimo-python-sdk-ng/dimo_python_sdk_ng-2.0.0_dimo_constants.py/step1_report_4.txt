  "purpose": "Define network and contract addresses for different environments (Production and Development).",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings within the dictionary for addresses and RPC providers.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; data is stored in a dictionary without further processing or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Data is static; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a dictionary with hardcoded addresses and RPC URLs for different environments. These are static values assigned directly in code, with no indication of input handling, network communication, or dynamic execution. The addresses are standard Ethereum addresses, and the RPC URL appears to be a public provider. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The data could be used in blockchain interactions, but nothing inherently malicious is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration snippet containing hardcoded network and contract addresses. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger application, likely for blockchain interaction purposes.",
