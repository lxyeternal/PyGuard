  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a static Python dictionary defining environment-specific constants (NFT addresses and RPC URLs).\n- No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data processing is present.\n- The addresses and URLs are typical for blockchain configurations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n- The code appears to be a benign configuration snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points per report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms straightforward static data with no anomalies.\n- Malware score: 0 — correct.\n- Security risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- Confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Notes the hardcoded addresses and URLs are typical but could be misused if exposed.\n- Malware score: 0 — correct.\n- Security risk: 0.1 — perhaps slightly overcautious, but acceptable given the exposure of addresses and URLs.\n- Confidence: 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to above, with no anomalies.\n- Malware score: 0 — correct.\n- Security risk: 0.1 — consistent.\n- Confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates the benign nature of static configuration.\n- Malware score: 0 — correct.\n- Security risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- Confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion: straightforward, static data.\n- Malware score: 0 — correct.\n- Security risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- Confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify the code as static configuration with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No significant errors. The only minor point is that some reports assign a security risk of 0.1 due to exposure of hardcoded addresses/URLs, which is a cautious stance but not necessarily a security risk in isolation.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature.  \n  The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Risk scores:**  \n  The reports assign a security risk of 0.1 in some cases, which seems reasonable given that exposing hardcoded addresses and URLs could be considered a minimal risk if the data is sensitive or could be exploited. Since these are public addresses and RPC URLs, the risk is minimal, but the cautious approach is acceptable.\n\n- **Malware scores:**  \n  Correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n  The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They recognize the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a straightforward configuration with no malicious intent.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- The only potential point of discussion is the security risk score of 0.1, which could be slightly increased if the addresses or URLs were sensitive, but given their public nature, the current score is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — exposure of public addresses and URLs is minimal but warrants a cautious note.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns well with the code's nature. No significant security concerns are present.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe code is a typical configuration snippet with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score is appropriate given the exposure of public blockchain addresses and RPC URLs.",
