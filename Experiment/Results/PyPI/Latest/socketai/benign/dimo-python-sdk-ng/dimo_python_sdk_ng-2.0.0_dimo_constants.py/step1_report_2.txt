{
  "purpose": "Define configuration constants for different environments, specifically production and development, including blockchain addresses and RPC provider URLs.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded dictionary entries with environment-specific data (NFT addresses and RPC provider URLs).",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or data leakage points present in the code.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static data is used for configuration purposes only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded blockchain addresses and RPC URLs, which are typical in configuration files but could be misused if exposed or modified maliciously. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a static Python dictionary containing environment-specific constants such as blockchain addresses and RPC endpoints. No code execution, input handling, or data manipulation occurs. The addresses and URLs appear legitimate and typical for blockchain configuration, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. There are no suspicious functions, no dynamic code execution, and no embedded secrets or credentials beyond public addresses and URLs. Overall, the code appears to be a benign configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration dictionary for blockchain environment settings. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The hardcoded addresses and URLs are typical for such configuration files and do not pose a security threat by themselves.",
