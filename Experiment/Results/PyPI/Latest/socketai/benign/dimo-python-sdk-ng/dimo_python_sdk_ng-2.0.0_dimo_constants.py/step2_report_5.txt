  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a static dictionary with hardcoded environment-specific constants (NFT addresses and RPC URLs).\n- The code is purely configuration data, with no processing, input handling, or external communication.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The addresses and URLs appear legitimate and typical for blockchain configurations.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk score is very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is a static configuration dictionary with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The reports correctly interpret the code as benign configuration data.\n\n- **Misleading claims?**  \n  No. The reports avoid overinterpreting the data; they correctly state that these are typical configuration constants.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Confidence:** Mostly 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent with the code being plain.\n- **Malware:** 0, aligns with the analysis that no malicious activity is present.\n- **Security risk:** 0 or 0.1, reasonable given the static configuration and publicly known addresses.\n\n**Are any scores unreasonable?**  \nNo. The scores seem consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- All scores are 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate.\n- The code contains no dynamic behavior, no secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious indicators.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- Since the code is static configuration with known addresses and URLs, and no suspicious activity is detected, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the addresses and URLs are benign, which appears valid.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or embedded malicious payloads are present.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is plain and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, primarily due to exposure of configuration data, but not inherently risky)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard configuration snippet defining environment-specific constants for blockchain addresses and RPC URLs. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low-risk assessment. No further action needed.",
