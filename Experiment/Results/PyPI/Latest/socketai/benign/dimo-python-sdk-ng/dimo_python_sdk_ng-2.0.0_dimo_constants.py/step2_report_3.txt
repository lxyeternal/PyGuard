  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code snippets are simple static dictionaries defining environment-specific constants (NFT addresses and RPC URLs).\n- No dynamic code, input handling, or external data processing.\n- No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data exfiltration.\n- The addresses and URLs are typical and publicly known.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports correctly identify that the code is benign configuration data with no malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment; they correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data flow issues.\n- They acknowledge the presence of hardcoded values but correctly classify this as typical for configuration files.\n- No logical errors or unwarranted assumptions are apparent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound, and no errors are evident.\n\n---\n\n**3. Score Justification and Reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 or 0.1\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The `confidence` scores are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the straightforward analysis.\n\n**4. Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- The highest `securityRisk` is 0.1, which is reasonable given the potential exposure of hardcoded addresses if they were secret keys—here, they are public addresses, so risk is minimal.\n- No report assigns a high risk score unjustifiably.\n\n**5. Malware Score Justification:**\n- All reports assign `malware` = 0, which is justified; no malicious activity or payloads are present.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious actions.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is static configuration data with no malicious intent.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The minor security risk score of 0.1 is justified as a precaution since hardcoded addresses and URLs could be misused if exposed, but in this context, they are benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** 0.1 (to reflect the presence of hardcoded configuration data, but very low risk)\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n- The code is a simple static configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The low security risk score is appropriate, acknowledging that hardcoded data can be a minor concern if exposed, but not inherently dangerous here.\n- The malware score remains zero, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
