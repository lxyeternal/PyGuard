  "purpose": "Definition of configuration constants for different environments (Production and Development), including blockchain addresses and RPC providers.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded dictionary variables storing addresses and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external or untrusted sources; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A — static assignment without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static dictionary with environment-specific constants for blockchain addresses and RPC providers. These are hardcoded values that are typical in configuration files. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious logic is present. The RPC provider URL is publicly available and not sensitive, and the addresses appear to be blockchain addresses. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or potential exploits.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup with hardcoded constants. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical for application configuration files.",
