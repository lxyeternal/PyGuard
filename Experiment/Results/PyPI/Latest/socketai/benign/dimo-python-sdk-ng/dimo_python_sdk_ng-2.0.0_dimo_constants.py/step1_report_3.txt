{
  "purpose": "Define constants for different environments, including blockchain addresses and RPC provider URLs.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded values within the dictionary 'dimo_constants' for production and development environments.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only assigns static data without external output or data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a static dictionary defining environment-specific constants such as blockchain addresses and RPC endpoints. No user input, external data, or dynamic execution is present. The addresses and URLs are hardcoded, but this is typical for configuration constants. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity is observed. The URLs appear to be legitimate RPC providers; addresses are blockchain addresses. No evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or unsafe practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup with hardcoded constants, presenting no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical pattern for defining environment-specific parameters.",
