  "purpose": "To perform HTTP requests using specified methods, URLs, and session management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: http_method, url, session, headers, data, params, and additional kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests' library's request method which sends HTTP requests; response handling with response.raise_for_status() and response.json().",
  "flows": "Inputs (http_method, url, session, headers, data, params, kwargs) → request() method call → HTTP request sent → Response received → raise_for_status() and response.json() called → Return response data or None.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code. No unusual or suspicious code patterns. The code does not perform any malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Request class for encapsulating HTTP request logic, utilizing the requests library. It manages headers and data formatting, especially for JSON content. The session object is passed during initialization and used for sending requests. The code handles response status and JSON decoding safely. No embedded or hidden malicious behavior is present. It appears to be a standard HTTP client wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an HTTP request wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. It performs expected operations for making web requests and handling responses securely.",
