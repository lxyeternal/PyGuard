{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and type-checking functions to validate input parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters through function arguments: param_name, value, and expected_type.",
  "sinks": "The code raises exceptions (DimoTypeError) when type mismatches occur, which is a controlled behavior. No untrusted data is sent elsewhere or leaked.",
  "flows": "Input values are checked against expected types; on mismatch, an exception is raised with a message containing parameter details.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The exception message is descriptive but safe.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward type validation, raising custom exceptions when types do not match expectations. Exception messages include parameter names and types, which could potentially reveal implementation details but are typical in debugging or validation scenarios. No use of external or untrusted sources, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. No malicious behavior or malware indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides standard input validation functions with custom exception handling, showing no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility module for type validation.",
