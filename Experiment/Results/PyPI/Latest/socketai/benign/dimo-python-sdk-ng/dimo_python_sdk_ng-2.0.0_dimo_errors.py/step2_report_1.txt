  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines custom exception classes: `DimoError`, `DimoTypeError`, `DimoValueError`.\n- Provides two functions: `check_type` and `check_optional_type` for type validation.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external data flow, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- Exception messages include parameter names and expected types, aiding debugging but not revealing sensitive info.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Validation classes and functions.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, no external sinks, no obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Benign, standard validation code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Analysis: No suspicious behaviors, no external data flow.\n- Conclusion: Standard utility, benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Validation functions.\n- Analysis: Same as above; detailed exception messages but no malicious intent.\n- Noted a `securityRisk` of 0.1, citing potential info leakage via exception messages.\n- **Justification for securityRisk=0.1:** The messages include parameter names and expected types, which could be considered slightly informative but are typical for debugging. No actual security vulnerability or data leak is present.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The slight risk is justified but minimal.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Validation within a larger project.\n- Analysis: No external data, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Validation functions.\n- Analysis: No anomalies, no suspicious code.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but no issues.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusions:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports agree on 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with a single report (3) assigning 0.1 due to the descriptive exception messages potentially revealing implementation details. This is a minimal concern but justifiable.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The slight securityRisk of 0.1 in report 3 is reasonable given the descriptive exception messages.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 — minimal risk due to detailed exception messages, but not a vulnerability.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign validation utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minor security risk score reflects the potential for information disclosure via exception messages, but this is typical and not inherently dangerous.\n\n**Final note:** Ensure that in production, exception messages do not leak sensitive info if parameter names or types are considered sensitive, but in this context, they are standard debugging messages.",
