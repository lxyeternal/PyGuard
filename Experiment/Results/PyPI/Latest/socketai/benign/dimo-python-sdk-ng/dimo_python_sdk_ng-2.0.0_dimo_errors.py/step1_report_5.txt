{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and type-checking utility functions for validating input types.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as param_name, value, and expected_type, which receive external input or data.",
  "sinks": "Exception message construction which outputs formatted strings, potential for string manipulation but not malicious intent.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through the type-checking functions and into exception constructors which generate error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom exceptions and provides utility functions for type validation, raising exceptions with detailed messages when type mismatches occur. No external network calls, file I/O, or other side effects are present. The exception classes and functions are straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious logic. The message construction appears standard and does not include dynamic or unsafe content beyond typical error reporting.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for type validation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured for its purpose and contains no suspicious or malicious elements.",
