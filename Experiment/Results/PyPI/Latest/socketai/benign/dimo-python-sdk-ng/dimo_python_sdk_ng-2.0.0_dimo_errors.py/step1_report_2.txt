  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and type-checking functions for validating input parameters.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as param_name, value, expected_type in check_type and check_optional_type functions.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages and raising of custom exceptions with detailed messages.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated via isinstance checks, and exceptions are raised if validation fails, with messages that include parameter details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, no code injection, no network operations, and no data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom exception classes for type and value errors, and provides functions to enforce type constraints on parameters. The exception messages include parameter names and expected types, aiding debugging. No external data input, network access, or sensitive information handling is present. The code performs standard type validation without any obfuscation or hidden behaviors. It appears to be a straightforward utility module for input validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard input validation utility with no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks identified. It solely defines exception classes and type-check functions, with no indication of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
