{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and type-checking functions for use in validation within a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all input data comes from function parameters within the module.",
  "sinks": "Raising custom exceptions with messages; no direct output or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to type-check functions, which may raise exceptions if validation fails.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes (DimoError, DimoTypeError, DimoValueError) and functions (check_type, check_optional_type) for type validation. It performs straightforward type checks and raises exceptions with descriptive messages if types do not match. No network activity, no data leaks, and no malicious behaviors are present. The code is well-structured, typical for input validation modules, and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions and type validation functions with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility module intended for input validation.",
