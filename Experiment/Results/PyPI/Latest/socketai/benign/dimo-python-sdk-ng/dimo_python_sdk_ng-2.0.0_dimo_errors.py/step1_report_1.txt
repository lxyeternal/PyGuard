{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and type-checking utility functions for validation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in 'check_type' and 'check_optional_type' functions",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; functions raise exceptions upon validation failure but do not perform malicious actions",
  "flows": "Input data is validated against expected types; no data flows to external systems or unsafe locations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors; code is straightforward and intended for validation",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with constructors for detailed error messages. The functions check_type and check_optional_type perform type validation and raise custom exceptions if validation fails. No external data transmission, system modification, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is typical for input validation and exception handling in Python, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payload, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions and type validation functions. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
