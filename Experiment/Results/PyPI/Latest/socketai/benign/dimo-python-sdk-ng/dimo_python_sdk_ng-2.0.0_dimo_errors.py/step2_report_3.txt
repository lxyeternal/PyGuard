  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code defines custom exceptions and validation functions. No malicious activity, no data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. The security risk score is appropriately low.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward validation, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous report; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with a note that exception messages include parameter details which could potentially reveal implementation details but are typical in validation code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The slight increase in security risk score (0.1) is justified due to detailed exception messages that could, in theory, expose internal info if misused. No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar validation code, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely for validation and exception handling.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree.\n- **Risk Score:** The only slight variation is the 0.1 for security risk in report 3, justified by detailed exception messages that could reveal internal info. Given the benign nature of the code, a risk score higher than 0.1 would be unwarranted.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (due to detailed exception messages, but overall low risk)\n\nThis code is a standard validation utility with no security issues or malicious intent. The existing scores are appropriate, with a minor adjustment to the security risk score in report 3.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
