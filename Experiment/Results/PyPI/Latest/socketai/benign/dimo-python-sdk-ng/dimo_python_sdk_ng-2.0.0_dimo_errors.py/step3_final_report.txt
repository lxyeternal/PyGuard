  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and validation functions for type checking of parameters.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'param_name', 'value', and 'expected_type' used as input for validation functions.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages constructed with parameter names and expected types; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into 'isinstance' checks, which may trigger exceptions with messages including parameter info.",
  "anomalies": "The 'DimoTypeError' constructor uses 'expected_type.__name__', which can cause an AttributeError if 'expected_type' is a tuple; this is a code correctness issue, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward validation with custom exceptions. No external data flows, network activity, or obfuscation are present. Exception messages include parameter names and types, which could slightly leak implementation details but are typical in debugging. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The only minor concern is the potential AttributeError in 'DimoTypeError' when 'expected_type' is a tuple, which should be handled for robustness. Overall, the code is benign and standard for input validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign validation utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only issue is a minor robustness flaw in exception message construction. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The code does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks.",
