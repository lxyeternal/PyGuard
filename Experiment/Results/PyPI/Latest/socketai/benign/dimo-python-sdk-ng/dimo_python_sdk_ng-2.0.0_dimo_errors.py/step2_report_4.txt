  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward utility module defining custom exception classes and type validation functions.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or side effects are identified.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code behaviors are reported.\n- The only minor concern is the detailed exception messages which could reveal internal parameter names and types, but this is common in validation code and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description. It defines custom exceptions and type-checking functions, which are present and functional.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risks:** The only potential concern is the detailed exception messages, but this is standard and does not constitute a security vulnerability.\n\n### Specific observations:\n- **Error in `DimoTypeError` constructor:** The message uses `expected_type.__name__`, which assumes `expected_type` is a single type. However, `expected_type` can be a tuple (as per the type hints), which does not have a `__name__` attribute, leading to an AttributeError if a tuple is passed. This is a flaw in the code, not malicious but worth noting.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Justification |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     | No malicious behavior, code is benign validation utility. |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Same as above; standard validation code. |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   | Slight concern about detailed exception messages, but not a security risk. The risk score seems appropriate. |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Benign validation code, no malicious behavior. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Same as above; no malicious activity. |\n\n**Note:** The overall malware score remains 0 across reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minor concern about exception message verbosity, but not a security risk)\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The code is a standard implementation of input validation with custom exceptions.\n- The only flaw is the potential `AttributeError` in `DimoTypeError` if `expected_type` is a tuple. This should be handled by checking if `expected_type` is a tuple and constructing the message accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions, with a slight adjustment acknowledging the code's minor flaw in handling `expected_type` when it is a tuple.",
