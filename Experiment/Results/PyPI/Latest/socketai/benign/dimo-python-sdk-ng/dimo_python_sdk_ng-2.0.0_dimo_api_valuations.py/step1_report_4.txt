{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for interacting with a vehicle valuation API, providing methods to retrieve valuations and offers.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are 'vehicle_jwt' (a string) and 'token_id' (an integer), passed as method parameters.",
  "sinks": "The '_request' method acts as a sink, executing HTTP requests with the constructed URL and headers, potentially exposing data if misused.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated via 'check_type', then used to build API endpoint URLs, which are passed to '_request' to make HTTP GET calls with appropriate headers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The URLs are constructed dynamically but follow a consistent pattern. No use of eval, exec, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client encapsulating vehicle valuation endpoints. It validates inputs and constructs URLs based on input parameters. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The URLs appear standard for API access; the 'headers' are generated via a provided function. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client class with proper input validation. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code fragment.",
