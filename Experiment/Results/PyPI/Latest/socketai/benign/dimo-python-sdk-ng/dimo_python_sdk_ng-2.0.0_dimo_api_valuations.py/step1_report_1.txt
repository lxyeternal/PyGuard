  "purpose": "This code provides a class for handling vehicle valuation and offer lookup API requests, wrapping around an external request method.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'vehicle_jwt' (string), 'token_id' (int), and methods like 'self._get_auth_headers' that generate headers based on 'vehicle_jwt'.",
  "sinks": "API request calls via 'self._request' which sends HTTP requests to specified URLs with headers.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then used to construct URLs and headers for API requests, which are then executed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation; URLs seem standard for API endpoints.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward input validation with 'check_type', constructs URLs with provided IDs, and makes API requests using a supplied request function. There is no evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The URLs and functions appear standard for an API client interface. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper class with input validation, no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain hidden backdoors.",
