{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for retrieving vehicle valuations and offers via HTTP requests, encapsulated within the Valuations class.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters: vehicle_jwt (a string) and token_id (an integer). The code also calls external functions check_type and self._request, and uses self._get_auth_headers to generate headers.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request method self._request is the main sink, which sends data over the network. Potential data leaks could occur if self._request or _get_auth_headers leak sensitive data, but no evidence of such leakage exists here.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (vehicle_jwt, token_id) flow into URL construction and header generation. These are used directly in HTTP requests, which are sent via self._request.",
  "anomalies": "The URL in offers_lookup lacks a leading slash (/v2/...), which might cause incorrect URL formation. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected. The code relies on external functions for validation and request handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods that construct URLs based on input parameters and invoke external request functions. It performs type checks on input parameters, which is good practice. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL patterns, or unusual behaviors. The missing slash in offers_lookup URL could lead to request issues but not malicious activity. The external functions check_type and self._request are assumed to be safe, with no indication of malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward API wrapper code with standard security considerations.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard API wrapper class that securely handles input parameters and constructs network requests. The only minor issue is the potentially malformed URL in offers_lookup, which is unlikely to be malicious but could impact functionality.",
