  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward API wrapper with input validation, no malicious patterns, no obfuscation, and standard URL endpoints.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The slight security risk might be due to the external request function, but nothing suspicious is evident.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the absence of secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. URLs are standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score perhaps due to the external functions, but no actual issues are detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Notes a URL typo (missing slash in `offers_lookup` method), but explicitly states this is unlikely malicious, more a potential functional bug.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; the URL typo does not imply security risk.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports; no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior findings.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Reiterates the straightforward nature of the code, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, indicating no malicious activity. The code is a simple API client.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly higher in some reports (up to 0.2), but primarily due to external request functions and URL construction, not malicious intent.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The only minor anomaly is the missing slash in `offers_lookup` URL, which could cause request issues but is not malicious.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- The code performs standard input validation and request handling.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at **0**.\n- The security risk score could be slightly increased from 0.1–0.2 to **0.2**, acknowledging the potential for request misbehavior due to URL typo, but not indicating malicious intent.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (due to the URL typo and external request handling, but no malicious activity)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured API wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor URL typo should be fixed for correctness but does not constitute a security risk.",
