{
  "purpose": "API wrapper class for vehicle valuations and offers, validating input and making HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'vehicle_jwt' and 'token_id'; URL construction; headers via '_get_auth_headers'.",
  "sinks": "Request function call with URL and headers; potential request errors due to URL formatting.",
  "flows": "Input parameters validated -> URL constructed -> headers generated -> request invoked.",
  "anomalies": "In 'offers_lookup', URL lacks a leading slash ('v2/vehicles/...') which may cause request failures but not security issues.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client with input validation, URL construction, and request invocation. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The only minor concern is the missing slash in 'offers_lookup', which could lead to request errors but not malicious activity. Malware scores are correctly zero; security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the benign nature of the code. External functions are assumed safe; no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code structure and logic are sound, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API wrapper with proper validation. The only technical issue is a URL formatting minor bug, which does not impact security. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero; security risk scores are low and appropriate.",
