{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for interacting with vehicle valuation and offer data via HTTP requests, likely to an external API.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: vehicle_jwt (string), token_id (int); method calls like self._request and self._get_auth_headers.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request function self._request; URL and headers constructed from input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (vehicle_jwt, token_id) are validated, used to construct URLs and headers, then passed to self._request to perform API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. The URLs and headers are dynamically generated; no suspicious data handling or obfuscation present. No data leakage or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input types, constructs API endpoints dynamically, and makes HTTP requests using provided request and header functions. The URLs are standard for vehicle data retrieval and do not contain embedded secrets. No use of eval, exec, or other dynamic code execution. No suspicious network activity or backdoors detected. The structure appears typical for API client code, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward API client implementation for vehicle valuation services, with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It follows standard practices for input validation and request construction.",
