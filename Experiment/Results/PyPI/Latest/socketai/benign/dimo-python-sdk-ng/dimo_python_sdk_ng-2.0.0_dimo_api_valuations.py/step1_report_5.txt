  "purpose": "A class for interacting with vehicle valuation-related API endpoints.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'vehicle_jwt' and 'token_id'; method calls to '_request' and '_get_auth_headers'.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request made via '_request' method with headers generated by '_get_auth_headers'.",
  "flows": "Input 'vehicle_jwt' and 'token_id' are validated, then used to construct URLs and headers for API requests. Data flows from input validation to request execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, and no unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The class methods perform input validation using 'check_type', then construct API endpoint URLs incorporating 'token_id', and pass headers generated by '_get_auth_headers(vehicle_jwt)'. The request method is invoked with standard HTTP method 'GET'. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is evident. The code appears to be a straightforward API client interface with proper validation and no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard API client wrapper for vehicle valuation endpoints. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
