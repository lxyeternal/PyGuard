  "purpose": "Ethereum message signing utility that signs a message with a private key and returns the signature.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: message (string), private_key (string); Private key normalization step.",
  "sinks": "Signed message returned as hex string; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Private key normalization -> message encoding -> account creation -> message signing -> signature output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of cryptographic libraries; proper key normalization.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Ethereum message signing using well-established libraries. It normalizes the private key, encodes the message, signs it, and returns the signature. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The process aligns with best practices. The scores from reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Ethereum message signer with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with its functionality. No further action is necessary.",
