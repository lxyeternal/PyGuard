{
  "purpose": "To sign messages using an Ethereum private key, providing a digital signature for verification purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'message' and 'private_key' used for signing the message.",
  "sinks": "The 'sign_message' method generates and returns a signed message signature as a hex string.",
  "flows": "The private_key is sanitized, then used to instantiate an account; the message is encoded, signed, and the signature is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard message signing with no evident hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No external data sources or network calls are present. No obfuscation or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely processes the private key by ensuring proper hex prefix formatting, encodes the message, and signs it with the eth_account library. It returns a hex-encoded signature. The flow is straightforward and aligns with standard cryptographic signing practices. No suspicious or malicious behaviors detected, such as data exfiltration or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of Ethereum message signing without any malicious intent or security issues. It performs standard cryptographic operations safely and correctly.",
