  "purpose": "Defines environment URLs for different deployment stages (Production and Development) for various API services related to Dimo.",
  "sources": "The dictionary assignment assigns URLs to keys representing environment stages and services.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is read from or written to untrusted sources within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only initializes a static data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a dictionary 'dimo_environment' with nested dictionaries for 'Production' and 'Dev' environments, each containing service endpoints as URL strings. These URLs appear to be legitimate API endpoints for various services under the 'dimo.zone' domain, with no evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code. There are no external inputs, no dynamic execution, or other suspicious behaviors. The structure is straightforward and static.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration data structure setting environment-specific API endpoints. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks evident in this snippet.",
