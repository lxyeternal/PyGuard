  "purpose": "Configuration data defining environment-specific API endpoints for production and development environments.",
  "sources": "Static URL strings within the nested dictionaries for each environment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration with no data flow or external input.",
  "flows": "N/A — static data; no data flow or processing involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with clear URL strings and no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static dictionary containing environment URLs for 'Production' and 'Dev'. It does not involve dynamic code, user input, or external data handling. All URLs appear legitimate and consistent. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or embedded secrets are present. The code serves as configuration data, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration structure with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
