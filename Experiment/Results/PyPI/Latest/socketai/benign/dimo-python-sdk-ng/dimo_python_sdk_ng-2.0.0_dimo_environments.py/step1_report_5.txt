{
  "purpose": "Defines environment URLs for different deployment stages (Production and Development) of an API-based system.",
  "sources": "Assignment of URL strings to dictionary keys within 'dimo_environment' for different environments.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; no untrusted data processing or external output operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code simply stores static URL strings in a nested dictionary; no data flows from sources to sinks, nor is there external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated elements, or suspicious constructs detected. The URLs appear consistent with typical environment configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration dictionary mapping environment names to API endpoint URLs. These URLs are hardcoded string literals that specify API endpoints for production and development environments. There are no dynamic inputs, external data reads, or processing functions. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure is straightforward, serving as configuration data for an application. The URLs are domain-specific but do not contain any embedded code or executable content. Overall, this appears to be a standard configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup that stores environment-specific API URLs. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The structure is simple, and there are no indicators of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
