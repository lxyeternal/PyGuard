  "purpose": "Define environment URLs for different deployment stages (Production and Development).",
  "sources": "Assignment of a dictionary containing environment URLs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only defines data structures without executing untrusted operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static data assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive information beyond URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a dictionary named 'dimo_environment' with nested dictionaries for 'Production' and 'Dev' environments, each containing URL strings for various API endpoints. These URLs appear to be standard configuration data used to connect to APIs. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns. No user input or external data is processed or transmitted. The data is static and appears to be part of configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration data structure defining environment URLs. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks inherent in this snippet.",
