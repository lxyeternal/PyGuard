  "purpose": "Define environment-specific API endpoint URLs for production and development environments",
  "sources": "Hardcoded URLs in the dimo_environment dictionary",
  "sinks": "Potential use of URLs for network requests or data transmission",
  "flows": "The URLs serve as endpoints for network requests, but there is no code demonstrating actual data flow or network communication in the provided snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a dictionary containing environment-specific API URLs. No input handling, data processing, or network communication is shown. The URLs appear to be standard API endpoints related to Dimo services, with no signs of malicious intent. There are no suspicious code structures, obfuscation, or anomalous behaviors. It is a static configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration dictionary containing environment URLs. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
