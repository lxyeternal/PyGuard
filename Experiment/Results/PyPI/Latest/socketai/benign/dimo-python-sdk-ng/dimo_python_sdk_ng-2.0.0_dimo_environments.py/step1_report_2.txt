{
  "purpose": "Definition of environment URLs for different deployment stages (Production and Development) of a system, likely for API endpoints.",
  "sources": "The code itself, specifically the dictionary assignments that contain URLs for different services.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if these URLs are used directly in network requests without validation, they could be exploited or misused in further code, but the snippet itself only defines static data.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows or untrusted input sources are present; the data is statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are observed. The URLs are consistent and structured; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary with environment configurations for Production and Development, listing various service endpoints. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. The URLs point to the 'dimo.zone' domain with subdomains indicating different APIs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident. The code appears to be a standard configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration of environment URLs, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks detected. It is a typical setup for defining API endpoints in a project.",
