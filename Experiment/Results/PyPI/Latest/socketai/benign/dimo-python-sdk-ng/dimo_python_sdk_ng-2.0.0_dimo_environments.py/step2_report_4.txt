  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code snippet and applying critical reasoning.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static dictionary defining environment URLs for production and development environments.\n- No dynamic code, user input, or external data sources are involved.\n- The URLs are consistent, domain-specific, and appear legitimate.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are evident.\n- The code's purpose is configuration, with no network activity or data flow demonstrated.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity of Reports\n\n**Issue presence:**  \n- The code snippet does **not** contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.  \n- All reports correctly identify this as a straightforward configuration data structure.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**  \n- No errors are present in the reports' reasoning; they uniformly conclude that this is benign configuration code.\n\n**Scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n- All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, with confidence 1.  \n- These scores are reasonable given the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Justification of Scores and Potential Adjustments\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; the code is clear and readable.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 is appropriate; no vulnerabilities or risky practices are evident.\n\n**Any higher scores?**  \n- No, given the evidence, scores should remain at zero.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Claims and Assumptions\n\n- The reports assume that because the code is static and domain-specific, it poses no security risk. This is correct.  \n- No suspicious URLs or patterns are present.  \n- No external inputs or dynamic behaviors are involved, so no risk of injection or data leakage.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations\n\nBased on the detailed review:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe code is a simple, static configuration dictionary defining environment-specific API endpoints. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
