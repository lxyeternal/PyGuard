{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports the DIMO class from a local module and exposes it for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module '.dimo' to import DIMO.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "The source is the import from '.dimo', which is then exposed via '__all__'. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import and export pattern with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports DIMO from a local module and defines '__all__' to expose DIMO publicly. It contains no logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module export statement with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's behavior. No further action is necessary.",
