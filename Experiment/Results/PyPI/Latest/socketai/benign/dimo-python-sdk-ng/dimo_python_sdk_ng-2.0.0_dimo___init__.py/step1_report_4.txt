{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports the DIMO class or object from a local submodule named 'dimo' and exposes it publicly via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module '.dimo' during import.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The only flow is importing 'DIMO' from the local module, which is a standard import process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement and a __all__ declaration. It does not execute any untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain suspicious logic. The local import suggests modular design but does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module declaration for exporting 'DIMO' from a local submodule. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
