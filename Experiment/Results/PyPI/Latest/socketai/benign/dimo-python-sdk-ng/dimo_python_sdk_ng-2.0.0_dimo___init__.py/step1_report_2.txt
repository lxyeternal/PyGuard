{
  "purpose": "The code exports a class or object named 'DIMO' from a local module 'dimo', likely to make it available for import elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a local module and defines __all__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink operations, no data leaks, or untrusted data handling in this code.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'DIMO' from a local module and exposes it via __all__, with no data flow beyond module import and export.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple module export statement, importing 'DIMO' from a relative module 'dimo' and exposing it publicly. It does not contain any logic, input handling, or external communication. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic module export with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard package boilerplate code.",
