  "purpose": "Decode permission bits from a hexadecimal string representing permissions, returning a list of granted permission indices.",
  "sources": "permission_hex input parameter, which is a string representing a hexadecimal number",
  "sinks": "int conversion and bitwise operations on permission_bits, which process the input data",
  "flows": "permission_hex -> clean_hex -> permission_bits -> bitwise shift and masking -> granted_permissions list",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code uses standard conversions and bitwise operations.",
  "analysis": "The code takes a hex string, cleans it, converts to an integer, then iterates over 128 bits to identify permission bits set to '11'. It appends indices where this condition is met. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and no suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and appears to perform permission decoding without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard permission decoding utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs bitwise operations in a typical manner and does not handle or expose sensitive information.",
