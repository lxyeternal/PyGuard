  "purpose": "Decode permission bits from a hexadecimal string representing permissions, returning a list of granted permission indices.",
  "sources": "permission_hex parameter input, which is a string expected to contain a hex value.",
  "sinks": "The int conversion and bit-shifting operations, which process the input data but do not directly lead to data leaks or external actions.",
  "flows": "Input string (permission_hex) -> cleans and converts to integer -> iterates through bits -> identifies granted permissions based on bits -> returns list.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard bitwise operations with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs. No external network or file operations are present. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The function cleans the input string, converts it from hex to an integer, then iterates over 128 bits. For each bit pair, if both bits are set (0b11), it records the index. This is a straightforward permission decoding logic. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed. No suspicious external interactions or hidden functionality detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard permission decoding utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply processes input data to produce a list of permissions based on bitwise flags. No anomalies or malware indications are present.",
