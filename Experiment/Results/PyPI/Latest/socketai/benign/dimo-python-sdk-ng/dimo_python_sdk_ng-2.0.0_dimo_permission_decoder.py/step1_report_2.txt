  "purpose": "Decode permission bits from a hexadecimal string representing permissions, returning a list of granted permission indices.",
  "sources": "permission_hex parameter received by decode_permission_bits method, input string possibly from external sources.",
  "sinks": "int conversion from hexadecimal string, bitwise operations for permission decoding.",
  "flows": "permission_hex -> cleaned_hex -> int conversion -> bitwise shifting and masking -> list of permissions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code performs straightforward permission decoding.",
  "analysis": "The code converts a hex string to an integer, then iterates over 128 bits to identify permission bits set to '11'. The logic is simple and appears to be a standard permission decoding routine. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, no external data transmission, no obfuscated code, and no hidden backdoors. It uses basic string manipulation, type conversion, and bitwise operations, which are standard for such tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign permission decoding utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply processes permission bits from a hex string.",
