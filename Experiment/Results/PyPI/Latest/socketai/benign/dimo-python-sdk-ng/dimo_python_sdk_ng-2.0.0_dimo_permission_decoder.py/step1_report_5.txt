  "purpose": "Decode permission bits from a hexadecimal string representing permissions in a binary format.",
  "sources": "permission_hex parameter input, string replacement, hex to int conversion",
  "sinks": "int conversion and bitwise operations, no external sinks or output streams involved",
  "flows": "Input string -> clean_hex -> permission_bits -> bitwise shifts -> output list",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious loops or functions, straightforward permission decoding logic. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a static method to decode permission bits from a hex string. It cleans the input, converts it to an integer, and then checks each pair of bits up to 128 positions. Permissions with both bits set ('11') are recorded. The code appears to perform a standard permission decoding operation without any malicious behavior. There are no external data leaks, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code does not interact with environment variables, files, or network. It solely processes input data and returns a list of permission indices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward permission decoding utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard bitwise operations and data processing without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
