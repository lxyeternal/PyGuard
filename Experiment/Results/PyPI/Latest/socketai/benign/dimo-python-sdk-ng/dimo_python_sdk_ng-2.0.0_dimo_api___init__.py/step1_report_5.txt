{
  "purpose": "The code exports modules related to authentication, attestation, device definitions, token exchange, trips, and valuations, likely part of a larger application or SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the current package: auth, attestation, device_definitions, token_exchange, trips, valuations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data handling, network communication, or data leakage are present.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports modules and defines an __all__ list; no data flows or processing logic are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, only performing imports and defining exports; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are observed.",
  "analysis": "This source code acts as an index or package initializer, exporting several modules for external use. It does not process input, handle data, or perform any operations that could be exploited. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The simplicity reduces risk, and the code appears to serve a standard modular purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export file with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and typical for a Python package's __init__.py or similar.",
