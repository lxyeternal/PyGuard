{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer that imports specific classes from sibling modules and defines the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions from local modules: auth, attestation, device_definitions, token_exchange, trips, valuations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports classes and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module __init__.py pattern, importing classes from sibling modules and exposing them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and clarity. Confidence is high (1) due to the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
