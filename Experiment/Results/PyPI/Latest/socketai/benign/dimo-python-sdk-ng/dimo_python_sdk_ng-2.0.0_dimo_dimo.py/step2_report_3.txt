  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical API client with no malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code does not contain any signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The use of regex in `_get_full_path` is standard for URL parameter substitution.\n- Tokens are passed as parameters, not stored insecurely.\n- No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. The low security risk reflects typical API client concerns, not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard API client, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Same reasoning applies; no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- Use of standard libraries and patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard API client, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No suspicious code or behavior.\n- Proper token handling.\n- URL construction via regex is standard.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard API client with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- All data flows are typical for an SDK.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous; standard SDK, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- Use of external modules and URL handling is standard.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is consistent; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports. Given the code's nature as an API client with token handling, this seems appropriate—it's a low but non-zero risk due to potential misuse if tokens are mishandled externally.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.\n- The use of regex for URL parameter substitution is standard.\n- Token management is explicit and not stored insecurely.\n- No signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports, reflecting typical API client risks but no active threats)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The provided reports are accurate. The scores are reasonable and justified based on the code's content. No modifications are necessary.",
