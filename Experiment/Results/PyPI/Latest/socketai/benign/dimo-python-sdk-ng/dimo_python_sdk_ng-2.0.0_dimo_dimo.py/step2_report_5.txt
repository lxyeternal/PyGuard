  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a typical API client class managing REST and GraphQL requests.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious network activity are evident.\n- URL construction uses regex substitution for path parameters, which is standard.\n- Tokens are passed explicitly to methods, not stored insecurely.\n- External modules (`re`, `requests`) are used in conventional ways.\n- No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or backdoors are visible.\n- The logic appears straightforward and intended for legitimate API interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly describes the code.\n- **Anomalies:** None identified.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The low malware and security risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard patterns.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the standard nature of the code.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious intent or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- Similar findings, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- Also describes the code as a standard SDK.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is a conservative, low risk, justified by the absence of vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The code appears benign, with no signs of supply chain threats, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, just a standard API client, but I keep it slightly above zero to acknowledge the potential for undiscovered issues in external modules or environment.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical, well-structured API client with no malicious or suspicious features. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
