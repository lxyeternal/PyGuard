{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to support retrying asynchronous and synchronous functions with exponential backoff, configurable via external parameters.",
  "sources": "External functions passed as 'fn', 'retry_if', 'delay_fn'; configuration parameters from 'ClientRetryConfiguration'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected; no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Function calls 'fn' with arguments; upon exception, evaluates 'retry_if'; calculates delay via 'delay_fn' or default; retries after delay.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors; standard exception handling and delay logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard retry logic with configurable parameters, handling exceptions and delays appropriately for both async and sync functions. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behaviors are present. It relies on external configuration and user-provided functions, which is typical for utility modules. No signs of data leaks, network activity, or backdoors. The exception handling and delay calculations are correct and standard. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard retry utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: approximately 0.1-0.2) are accurate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
