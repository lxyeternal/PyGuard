  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** Clear, straightforward retry utility functions for async and sync, relying on external configuration. No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no data leaks.\n- **Security assessment:** Very low risk, malware score 0, no malicious intent, standard pattern.\n- **Potential issues:** None identified.\n- **Score review:** The securityRisk of 0.1 seems appropriate given the benign nature. Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, well-structured retry functions with configurable delays and conditions. No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Security assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior; risk and malware scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard retry logic with exception handling and exponential backoff. No suspicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Security assessment:** No malicious intent; scores of 0 for malware and low for security risk are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports—standard retry mechanisms, no suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Security assessment:** No malicious activity; low security risk, malware score 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard retry utility functions, reliance on external functions and configurations. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Security assessment:** No signs of malware, no obfuscation, low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code matches the provided implementation.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis—no malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (around 0.1–0.2), justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?** Yes. The code is a standard retry utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores reflect that accurately.\n- **Any discrepancies?** No. All reports agree on the benign nature.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?** No. The only concern could be misuse if malicious functions are passed, but this is inherent to utility functions and not a security flaw.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard utility code with negligible security impact)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-implemented retry utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
