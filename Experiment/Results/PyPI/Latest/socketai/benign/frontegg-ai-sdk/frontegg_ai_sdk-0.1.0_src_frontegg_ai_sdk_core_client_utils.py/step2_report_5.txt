  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Provides async and sync retry functions with exponential backoff, configurable via external `ClientRetryConfiguration`. No suspicious behavior or malicious code detected.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Risk 0.1, Malware 0 — consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward retry logic, exception handling, no obfuscation, no data leaks, no malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** Safe, standard utility code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar retry utilities with configurable parameters, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious activity.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Risk 0.2, Malware 0 — consistent.\n- **Analysis:** Implements exponential backoff, exception handling, no external data leaks or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard retry mechanisms, exception handling, configurable delays, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Risk 0.2, Malware 0 — aligned.\n- **Analysis:** Typical implementation, no malicious payloads or suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Conclusion:** Safe, benign utility code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar retry logic, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns, standard practices.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Risk 0.2, Malware 0.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Retry utilities with configurable parameters, relies on external functions and configurations, no malicious patterns.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Risk 0.1, Malware 0.\n- **Analysis:** Standard design, potential reliance on external code but not suspicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports describe a standard, well-structured retry utility implementing exponential backoff for async and sync functions. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's straightforward nature.\n- **Security Risk:** The overall security risk is very low, mostly due to the utility nature and lack of malicious patterns.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the utility nature and lack of suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of retry logic with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on the collective review, I would keep them as follows:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a high confidence that the code is safe and benign.",
