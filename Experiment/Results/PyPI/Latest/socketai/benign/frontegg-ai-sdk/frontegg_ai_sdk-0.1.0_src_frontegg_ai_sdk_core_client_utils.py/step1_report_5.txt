{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for retrying asynchronous and synchronous functions with exponential backoff in a client application.",
  "sources": "Imports modules asyncio, time, and typing; reads configuration from .config; accesses attributes of retry_config such as tries, delay_in_ms, retry_if, delay_fn; reads function arguments",
  "sinks": "Calls user-provided functions (fn), potentially with untrusted arguments; awaits or calls these functions; sleeps using asyncio or time modules; may propagate exceptions",
  "flows": "Function call to retry_async or retry_sync -> execution of provided function -> exception handling -> decision to retry or raise -> delay calculation -> sleep -> repeat",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no unusual or misleading code patterns; no obfuscated code; standard retry logic implementation",
  "analysis": "The code implements retry logic for both async and sync functions, with configurable parameters for maximum retries, delay, and retry conditions. It uses exponential backoff with optional custom delay function. It relies on external configuration (ClientRetryConfiguration) for parameters. No input sanitization or dangerous data handling is present. No malicious network activity, code injection, or data leaks are detectable. The use of user-provided functions could theoretically execute malicious code if those functions are malicious, but this is expected behavior for a utility module.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a standard retry utility with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The only potential concern is its reliance on external functions, which is typical for such utilities and not inherently malicious.",
