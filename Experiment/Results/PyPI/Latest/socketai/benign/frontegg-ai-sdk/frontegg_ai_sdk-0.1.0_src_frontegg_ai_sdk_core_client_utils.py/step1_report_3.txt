{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to perform retry logic (with exponential backoff) for both asynchronous and synchronous functions within a client module.",
  "sources": "Import statements; retry_async and retry_sync functions; reading retry configuration from ClientRetryConfiguration.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; functions only perform retries and sleep calls based on provided configurations.",
  "flows": "Input data (functions and parameters) flow into retry functions; on exception, retry conditions are evaluated; delays are computed and awaited; eventually return function results or raise exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two retry functions, one asynchronous and one synchronous, using configurations from ClientRetryConfiguration. They perform retries with exponential backoff, optionally customized via delay_fn and retry_if. Both functions handle exceptions properly, decide whether to retry based on the provided logic, and delay appropriately. No insecure practices, suspicious data flows, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code strictly implements retry logic, which is standard for network or IO operations, and there are no indications of hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of retry mechanisms with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any malicious or sabotage-related functionality. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
