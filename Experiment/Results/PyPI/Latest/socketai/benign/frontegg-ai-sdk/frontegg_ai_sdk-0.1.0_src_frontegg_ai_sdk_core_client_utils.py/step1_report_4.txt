  "purpose": "Utility functions to perform retry logic (both async and sync) with exponential backoff for client operations.",
  "sources": "Configuration import from .config, usage of parameters for retry conditions and delay functions, and input functions passed as arguments (fn).",
  "targets": "The functions themselves, particularly the sleep/wait calls (asyncio.sleep and time.sleep).",
  "flows": "Input functions (fn) are called, exceptions are caught, delays are computed, then the process retries until success or attempts exhausted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of delay functions and retry conditions are standard. No suspicious data leaks, malicious network calls, or code injections present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides retry mechanisms for asynchronous and synchronous functions with configurable retry parameters. It performs exception handling, conditional retries, and exponential backoff delays. No signs of malicious payloads or suspicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, network probing, or backdoors. The import from .config indicates reliance on external configuration, which appears standard. Delay functions and exception handling are typical for robustness, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of retry logic with no indicators of malicious behavior. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
