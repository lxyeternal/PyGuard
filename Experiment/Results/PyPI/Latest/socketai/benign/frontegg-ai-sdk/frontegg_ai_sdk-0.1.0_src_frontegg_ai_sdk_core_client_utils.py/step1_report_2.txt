  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to support retry logic for asynchronous and synchronous functions with exponential backoff in an AI Clients module.",
  "sources": "Imports from .config, user-defined functions retry_async and retry_sync reading function parameters and retry configurations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted exception objects in exception handling, sleep delays possibly influencing timing, but no data is sent or received externally.",
  "flows": "Input functions (fn) are called; exception handling may trigger retries; delays are calculated and awaited; no external data leaks or injections occur.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or obfuscated code; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns; use of delays and retries is standard; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two retry functions, one asynchronous and one synchronous, implementing exponential backoff for retrying functions upon failure. Both functions check retry conditions via retry_if, and delays are computed either via a custom delay_fn or default exponential backoff. Exception handling is straightforward, with no external data input or output beyond the function call and sleep delays. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious activities are evident. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured retry mechanism with configurable behavior, serving typical resilience purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate retry utility implementing exponential backoff with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It contains no obfuscated or suspicious code. Overall security risk is negligible.",
