  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of retry logic for async and sync functions.\n- It relies on external configuration (`ClientRetryConfiguration`) for parameters like tries, delay, retry conditions, and delay functions.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- Exception handling appears correct, with retries conditioned on `retry_if`.\n- Delay calculations are standard exponential backoff or custom via `delay_fn`.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's intent.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious activity, considers the code safe, and assigns a high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Also finds no malicious activity, describes the code as standard retry logic, and assigns a high confidence (1).\n\n**Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** No malicious elements; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above, finds no suspicious activity, and confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** The code is a standard retry utility.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior, and the confidence level is 0.9.\n\n**Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Also finds no malicious activity, considers reliance on external functions as typical, and confidence is 0.9.\n\n**Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code's straightforward nature, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation; score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** The overall security risk is low; the highest is 0.2, which seems reasonable considering the utility nature of the code.\n\n**Potential concerns:**  \n- The only slight concern could be the reliance on external functions (`retry_if`, `delay_fn`) and user-provided functions (`fn`). If those functions are malicious, the utility could be misused, but this is inherent to any utility that executes external code, and not specific to this implementation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- The code is benign, standard, and does not contain malware or obfuscation.\n- No changes needed in the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 – 0.2 (slightly above zero due to reliance on external functions, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
