{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to retry asynchronous and synchronous functions with exponential backoff, based on a configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (asyncio, time, typing, local config); uses retry_config properties (tries, delay_in_ms, retry_if, delay_fn); accesses function parameters for retry logic.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not send data over networks, access sensitive data, or perform system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input functions (fn) are called and retried; delays are computed via delay_fn or default; exceptions are caught and conditionally retried based on retry_if.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation; straightforward retry logic with standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code implements retry mechanisms for async and sync functions, employing configurable retry conditions and delay strategies. It relies on external configuration for retry parameters, with standard exception handling and delays. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The logic is typical for resilient function execution and does not manipulate or leak data or perform unauthorized actions.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides safe, standard retry utilities with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It follows conventional design patterns and relies on external configurations for retry behavior. No suspicious or harmful code components are present.",
