{
  "purpose": "Provides core functionality and module imports for the Frontegg AI SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as enums, config, logger, client, and httpTransport from local package files.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input; no network, file, or environment operations are performed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present, as this is a module definition with imports and exports only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code structure appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components essential for the SDK's core functionality and defines an export list. It contains no dynamic code execution, input processing, or network activity. It appears to be a typical module setup with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initializer for the SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves as a simple entry point to aggregate and expose core components.",
