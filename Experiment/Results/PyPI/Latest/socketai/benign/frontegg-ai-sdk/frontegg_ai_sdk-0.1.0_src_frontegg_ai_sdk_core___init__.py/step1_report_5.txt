{
  "purpose": "The code sets up core imports and exports for the Frontegg AI SDK, organizing module components for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.enums, .config, .logger, .client, .httpTransport)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed or outputted within this code",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only imports and re-exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed; the code appears straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports specific components from internal modules and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The imports are from local modules, and no dynamic code execution or external data handling occurs here.",
  "conclusion": "This module functions as a simple aggregator for core SDK components, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign setup file.",
