{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a core module for the Frontegg AI SDK, importing key components such as enums, configuration, logging, client, and HTTP transport functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .enums, .config, .logger, .client, .httpTransport",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in this snippet; no handling of untrusted data or external inputs",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only imports modules and defines an __all__ list without processing external data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward, only defining module exports without executing complex or dynamic operations",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports and exposes components of the SDK, serving as an entry point or core module. It does not include data handling, user input, or external communication. The imports are from local modules, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or suspicious logic. The lack of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network operations reduces the risk profile.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module setup for an SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply organizes and exports core components for use elsewhere in the project.",
