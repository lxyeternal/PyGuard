  "purpose": "This code serves as a core module that imports various components and defines the public API for the SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.enums, .config, .logger, .client, .httpTransport).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static imports and export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no dynamic execution or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup that imports internal components and defines an __all__ list for exports. It contains no functions, no dynamic code, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted input. The code is standard boilerplate for SDK initialization. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0) are consistent with the code's static and straightforward structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
