  "purpose": "Provides core functionality for the Frontegg AI SDK by importing modules and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .enums, .config, .logger, .client, .httpTransport.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code only imports modules and defines an __all__ list.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no runtime data processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and typical for a module's initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific components and exports them via __all__. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or data handling that could indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or other suspicious activities are present. The simplicity and standard structure suggest it's a benign module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for an SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It only handles imports and exports, with no active data processing or network activity.",
