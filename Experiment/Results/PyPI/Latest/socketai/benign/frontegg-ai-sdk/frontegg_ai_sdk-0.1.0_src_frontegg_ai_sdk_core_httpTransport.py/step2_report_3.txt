  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a standard, well-structured client for MCP over HTTP, handling JSON-RPC, SSE, sessions, retries, and error handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code appears to implement typical patterns for HTTP/SSE clients.\n  - The session ID management, retries on 404, and parsing logic are standard.\n  - No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident.\n  - Exception handling is thorough, reducing potential attack surfaces.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 (consistent; no malicious code detected)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n  - **Risk:** 0.2 (low, given the standard implementation and no suspicious behavior)\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. The confidence (0.9) aligns with the thorough analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard HTTP/SSE client with session management, no suspicious behavior, and standard error handling.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n  - The code's behavior aligns with expected client-side communication.\n  - No obfuscation or malicious intent observed.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.2\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the implementation of an HTTPX and SSE-based client with session management, message handling, and no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No suspicious external calls or hidden behaviors.\n  - The code manages sessions, retries, and message parsing correctly.\n  - No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.2\n\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable and aligned with the code's apparent behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing legitimate JSON-RPC over HTTP/SSE, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n  - The code handles responses, sessions, and errors appropriately.\n  - No signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.2\n\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes a standard, secure implementation with no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No suspicious external connections or obfuscation.\n  - The code's behavior aligns with expected patterns.\n  - No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (even lower, indicating very low risk)\n\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code (0).\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation (0).\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) is reasonable given the complexity but no malicious activity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the detailed analyses.\n- The high confidence levels (0.9-0.95) are justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, given the standard, well-structured code with no suspicious patterns)\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, secure implementation of an HTTP/SSE client for MCP communication, with no malicious or maliciously intended features detected.",
