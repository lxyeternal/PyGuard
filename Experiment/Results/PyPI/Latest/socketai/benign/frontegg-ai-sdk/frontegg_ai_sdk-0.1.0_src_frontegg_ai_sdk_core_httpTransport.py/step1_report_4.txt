{
  "purpose": "The code implements a client transport module for MCP using HTTPX and SSE, supporting JSON-RPC messaging, session management, and streaming responses.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include incoming JSON-RPC messages from write_stream_reader, session IDs from server responses, and SSE events from server streams.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flows to the read_stream_writer when parsing JSON, SSE messages, or error objects; session termination via HTTP DELETE.",
  "flows": "Input data (messages, SSE events) flows through parsing and validation to the read_stream; session IDs flow from response headers to internal state; error handling may send exceptions to output.",
  "anomalies": "Code performs extensive JSON parsing, response handling, and SSE processing, but no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution are evident. The handling of array responses by converting first array element to JSONRPCMessage is unconventional but not malicious. No suspicious external network connections or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The module primarily manages HTTP POST requests, SSE streams, and session IDs with proper validation and error handling. It includes mechanisms to retry with a session ID, parse JSON and SSE messages, and handle different content types. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads are present. The use of logging and proper exception management indicates standard operational procedures. Overall, the code appears focused on legitimate client-server interactions for JSON-RPC over HTTP and SSE, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a streaming HTTP client for JSON-RPC communication, with session management and SSE support. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware signs are detected. The handling of array responses is unusual but not malicious. Overall security risks are minimal.",
