{
  "purpose": "Implement a client transport module for MCP using HTTPX and SSE, supporting session management, message sending, and server-initiated messages.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from write_stream_reader, HTTP response bodies, SSE events, and request headers.",
  "sinks": "Sending messages to read_stream_writer, modifying headers with session IDs, and network communication with the server.",
  "flows": "Data flows from write_stream_reader (client messages) through HTTP POST/SSE responses, potentially modifying session IDs, and outputs to read_stream_writer. Server responses via HTTP or SSE are parsed and sent to read_stream_writer.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious constants observed. Usage of dynamic JSON parsing and array handling appears standard. No obfuscated code detected. Session ID management is explicit. No unusual or misleading variable names or control flows.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an asynchronous HTTP client with support for POST requests, SSE streams, session management via headers, and message parsing. It carefully manages session IDs, retries on 404 errors, and handles JSON and SSE responses, including array responses. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or code injection are evident. Logging is extensive but standard for debugging and monitoring. No suspicious external network calls or hidden behaviors are detected. The logic appears to be a standard, well-structured client transport implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a secure, standard client transport module for HTTP and SSE communications with session management. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are detected. The implementation is clear, and the data flows are predictable and controlled. Overall, the code appears trustworthy and free from malware or malicious intent.",
