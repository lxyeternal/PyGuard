  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** The report concludes the code is standard, well-structured, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It assigns malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. The handling of JSON, SSE, session IDs, retries, and error management aligns with standard practices.\n\n- **Potential Issues:** No suspicious logic or hidden malicious behavior detected. The retry mechanism and session management are typical.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Given the code's clarity and standard pattern, malware = 0 is appropriate. Obfuscated = 0 is justified. Security risk = 0.2 is reasonable, considering the network operations, but no significant vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with an emphasis on the absence of secrets or suspicious code, and standard handling.\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code again shows standard JSON parsing, session management, and SSE handling.\n\n- **Potential Issues:** No anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9 are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing the standard nature of the implementation.\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n- **Potential Issues:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** The report states the code is a standard client for JSON-RPC over HTTP/SSE, with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code does not perform any suspicious activities or contain obfuscation.\n\n- **Potential Issues:** No anomalies detected.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** Similar conclusion: legitimate, standard implementation with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n- **Potential Issues:** No anomalies.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code contains no malicious logic, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network behavior, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code clarity.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's network operations, a small risk score is justified, but no significant vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, standard network operations, no secrets or backdoors)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of an HTTP/SSE client for JSON-RPC communication, with robust error handling, session management, and no signs of malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
