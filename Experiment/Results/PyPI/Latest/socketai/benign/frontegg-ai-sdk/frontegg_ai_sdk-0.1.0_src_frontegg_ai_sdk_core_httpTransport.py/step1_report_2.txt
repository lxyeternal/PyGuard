{
  "purpose": "Implement a client transport module for MCP protocol using HTTP and SSE for asynchronous messaging and session management.",
  "sources": "Input data includes 'url', optional 'headers', and data read from the write_stream; server responses via HTTP responses and SSE streams.",
  "sinks": "Sending messages through HTTP POST requests, session termination via DELETE requests, and reading SSE events which could be malicious if data is manipulated.",
  "flows": "Input data (write_stream messages) are sent via HTTP POST, server responses (including SSE data) are read and parsed, session ID is extracted from headers, and session termination is handled via DELETE request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the code handles session IDs and JSON parsing robustly; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an asynchronous HTTP client with SSE support, manages session IDs, and processes JSON/RPC messages and SSE events. It handles various response content types, retries on specific error codes, and manages session lifecycle. There are detailed logging and error handling mechanisms. The code appears to follow standard practices for async HTTP/SSE communication without suspicious or malicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code mainly performs expected network I/O operations, JSON parsing, and session management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured HTTP/SSE client module for MCP communication. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. It manages sessions securely and handles errors appropriately. Overall, the code appears benign with no malicious intent.",
