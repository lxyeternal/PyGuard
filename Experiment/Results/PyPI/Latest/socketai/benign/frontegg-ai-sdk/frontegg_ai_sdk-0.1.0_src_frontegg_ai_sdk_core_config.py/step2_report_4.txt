  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines a simple data class `FronteggAiClientConfig` with four fields: `environment`, `agent_id`, `client_id`, `client_secret`.\n- Imports `Environment` from a local module.\n- Stores sensitive data (`client_secret`) as plaintext in memory.\n- No functions, dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Observations:\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The code itself does not contain bugs or vulnerabilities; it is a straightforward configuration class. The only concern is the handling of sensitive data (`client_secret`) in plaintext, which is common but should be managed carefully.\n\n- **Malicious Behavior?**  \n  No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent. The code does not perform any network activity, code injection, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  None present.\n\n- **Security Risks?**  \n  Storing secrets in plaintext is a security concern but not malicious. The risk is in how this data is managed outside this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Report Scores:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2  \n- **Comment:** Correct; no malware, no obfuscation. The risk score reflects the concern about plaintext secrets, which is appropriate.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2  \n- **Comment:** Consistent; no malicious behavior, just plaintext secrets.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2  \n- **Comment:** Correct; straightforward configuration class with no malicious intent.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2  \n- **Comment:** Accurate; no malicious behavior, only sensitive data handling concern.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.3  \n- **Comment:** Slightly higher risk score, possibly due to emphasis on plaintext credentials. Still reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Are any scores unreasonable?\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature. The risk scores appropriately reflect the security concern about plaintext secrets but do not overstate maliciousness.\n\n### Should any scores be adjusted?\n- Given the code's simplicity and the absence of malicious activity, I agree with the assigned scores. The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Since there's no malicious code or behavior, a malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  No obfuscation present, so 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The main concern is plaintext secrets, which justifies a low to moderate risk (~0.2–0.3). No higher risk is warranted unless secrets are mishandled elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (reflecting the plaintext secret storage concern)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments, confirming that the code itself is benign but sensitive data handling should be done carefully.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- No issues with the current scores.\n- The code is a typical configuration class with no malicious behavior.\n- The main security concern is plaintext storage of secrets, which is well acknowledged.\n- No changes needed; the evaluations are appropriate.\n\n**End of review.**",
