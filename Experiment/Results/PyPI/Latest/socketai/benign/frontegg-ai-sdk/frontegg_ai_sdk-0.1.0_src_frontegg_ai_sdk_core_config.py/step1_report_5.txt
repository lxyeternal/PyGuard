  "purpose": "Define a configuration data class for the Frontegg AI client with environment and credential fields.",
  "sources": "Data class fields initialized with environment and credential values (agent_id, client_id, client_secret).",
  "sinks": "Potential credential exposure if instances of this class are logged, printed, or improperly handled; environment import from a module.",
  "flows": "User or system provides environment, agent_id, client_id, and client_secret; these are stored in the data class, potentially used later for authentication or API calls.",
  "anomalies": "Contains sensitive credential fields (client_secret) stored in plaintext within a data class; no encryption or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data class for configuration, which is common practice. However, it includes a plaintext 'client_secret' field, which if mishandled could lead to credential exposure. No external inputs, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The import from '.enums' suggests modular code design, but no malicious or harmful code is evident. The main concern is the handling of sensitive credentials in memory, which is a known security consideration but not necessarily malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data class definition for configuration purposes with no malicious intent detected. The main security risk lies in potential mishandling of plaintext credentials, not in malicious code or behavior.",
