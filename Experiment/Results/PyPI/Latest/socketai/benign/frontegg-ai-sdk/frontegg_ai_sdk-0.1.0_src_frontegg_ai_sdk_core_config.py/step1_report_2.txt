  "purpose": "Define a configuration data class for Frontegg AI client settings",
  "sources": "Input data: environment, agent_id, client_id, client_secret",
  "sinks": "Potential sensitive data: client_secret (stored as string), possibly used elsewhere in code",
  "flows": "Data flows from instantiation of FronteggAiClientConfig to usage in authentication or API calls",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated code; no unusual code patterns; sensitive data stored plainly in a dataclass",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data class with four fields, including a sensitive 'client_secret'. It imports necessary modules and a custom enum. No functions or dynamic code execution present. No hardcoded secrets; the secret is stored as plain text in an attribute, which is typical for config data but should be handled carefully in practice. No suspicious or malicious code detected. The structure is straightforward and intended for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration class with no malicious intent. It handles sensitive data in a common way, but care should be taken when managing the 'client_secret'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
