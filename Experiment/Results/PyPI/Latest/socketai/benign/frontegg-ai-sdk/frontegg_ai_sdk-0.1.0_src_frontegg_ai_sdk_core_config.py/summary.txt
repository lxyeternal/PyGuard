  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration class with no malicious intent. The primary security issue is the plaintext storage of secrets, which should be managed securely outside this code. The malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero; the moderate risk score (around 0.2-0.3) accurately reflects the security concern without indicating active threat."
