  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines a Python dataclass `FronteggAiClientConfig` with four fields: `environment`, `agent_id`, `client_id`, and `client_secret`.\n- Imports `Environment` from a local module.\n- No functions, dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- Stores sensitive data (`client_secret`) as plaintext.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n\n**Confirmed:**  \n- The code is a straightforward configuration class.  \n- It **does not** contain hardcoded credentials or malicious code.  \n- The `client_secret` is stored as plaintext, which is a security concern but not malicious.\n\n**No issues related to code logic or behavior** are evident beyond standard security best practices regarding secret handling.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n\n**Observation:**  \n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple data container with no malicious intent.  \n- They note the plaintext storage of sensitive data (`client_secret`) as a security concern.  \n- No report claims or implies malicious behavior or obfuscation, which aligns with the code.\n\n**Potential flaw in the reports:**  \n- The reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which is accurate.  \n- They assign a `securityRisk` score of 0.2 or 0.3, reflecting the risk of plaintext secrets, which seems reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- No significant logical flaws or mistakes are apparent in the reports.  \n- They are consistent and appropriately cautious.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Malware scores: All are 0, which is correct; no malicious code is present.  \n- Obfuscated scores: All are 0, which is appropriate.  \n- Security risk scores: Range from 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting the plaintext secret storage.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code.  \n- No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**\n\n**None of the reports** assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n**If any were to be increased:**  \n- It would require evidence of secret leakage, code injection, or malicious intent, which is not present.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Justification**\n\n- All reports assign malware = 0, which is justified.  \n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or code injection detected.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- All reports are cautious but not overly speculative.  \n- They correctly identify the plaintext storage of secrets as a security concern but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n\n- Scores are consistent: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk moderate due to plaintext secrets.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Expert Evaluation:**\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- **Should remain at 0.** No malicious code or behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- **Should remain at 0.** No obfuscation present.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- Given the plaintext storage of secrets, a moderate risk (around 0.2–0.3) is appropriate.  \n- If considering best practices, this could be slightly higher, but within the context, the current scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The code is benign and well-understood.  \n- The main security concern is handling plaintext secrets, which should be managed securely outside this code (e.g., environment variables, secret management tools).  \n- No changes to malware or obfuscated scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type      | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                   | No malicious activity present                                |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                   | No obfuscation or code hiding present                        |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2–0.3             | Due to plaintext secret storage, moderate concern          |\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard configuration class with no malicious intent. The security concern is the plaintext handling of secrets, which is a common but risky practice if not managed properly outside this code.**",
