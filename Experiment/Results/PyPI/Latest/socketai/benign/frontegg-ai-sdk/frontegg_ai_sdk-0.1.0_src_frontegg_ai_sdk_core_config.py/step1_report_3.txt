{
  "purpose": "Define a configuration data structure for a Frontegg AI client with environment and credential fields.",
  "sources": "The code reads from import statements and class attribute definitions, specifically 'agent_id', 'client_id', and 'client_secret'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sensitive data such as 'client_secret' could be used insecurely if mishandled, but no explicit sinks like network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user or external configuration into the class attributes, especially 'client_secret', 'client_id', and 'agent_id'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; the code merely defines a data structure. No unusual language features or obfuscation are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass for configuration purposes, including environment, agent ID, client ID, and secret. No code injection, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. Usage of sensitive credentials depends on implementation outside this snippet, but within this code, there are no suspicious patterns or behaviors. The import of 'Environment' from a local module suggests modular design, but no misuse is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple configuration holder without any malicious behavior or security risks directly visible. It appears standard and secure in isolation.",
