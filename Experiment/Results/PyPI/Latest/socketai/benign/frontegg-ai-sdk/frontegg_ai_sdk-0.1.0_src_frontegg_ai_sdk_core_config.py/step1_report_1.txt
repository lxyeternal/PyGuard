  "purpose": "Define a configuration data class for an AI client, including environment and credential fields.",
  "sources": "Class attributes: environment, agent_id, client_id, client_secret.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data stored in class attributes; no direct data leaks or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs to class attributes; no external flows or network activities are shown.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'client_secret' as a plain string attribute; no encryption or obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials evident in this snippet, but storing secrets directly is a security concern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class with four fields: environment, agent_id, client_id, and client_secret. All are plain data fields; the 'client_secret' may be sensitive. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code relies on external 'enums' module, which is not suspicious by itself. The data class setup is typical for configuration purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as backdoors, code injection, or data exfiltration. Storing secrets directly in code is a security best practice violation but not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration data class intended to store credentials and environment info. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation. The main concern is the plaintext handling of sensitive credentials, which is a security risk but not malicious behavior.",
