  "purpose": "Definition of a configuration data class for an AI client, holding environment and credential information.",
  "sources": "Class fields: environment, agent_id, client_id, client_secret.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of sensitive credentials (client_secret) which could be misused if accessed maliciously.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly shown; the class is a data container without operational code or data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credential fields (client_id, client_secret) which are sensitive; no validation or encryption shown.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass to store configuration parameters, including sensitive credentials (client_secret). No code executes any operation; the code itself does not contain malicious behavior. The main concern is that it stores sensitive data, which could be misused if exposed, but no malicious intent is evident from this fragment alone. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple configuration container with no evident malicious behavior. The inclusion of sensitive credentials warrants secure handling but does not indicate malicious activity. Overall security risk is low, assuming proper secrets management outside this code.",
