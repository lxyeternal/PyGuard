  "purpose": "Defines a configuration data class for an AI client, storing environment and credentials.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of the class with provided attribute values.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of 'client_secret' in authentication processes or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class instantiation to authentication or API calls using stored credentials.",
  "anomalies": "Plaintext storage of sensitive credentials ('client_secret') without encryption or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python dataclass with four fields, including sensitive data stored as plaintext. No dynamic code, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The main security concern is the plaintext handling of secrets, which could lead to credential exposure if mishandled outside this snippet. All reports correctly identify the absence of malware and obfuscation, with risk scores reflecting the plaintext secret storage. No logical errors or malicious patterns are detected; the scores are consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration class with no malicious intent. The primary security issue is the plaintext storage of secrets, which should be managed securely outside this code. The malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero; the moderate risk score (around 0.2-0.3) accurately reflects the security concern without indicating active threat.",
