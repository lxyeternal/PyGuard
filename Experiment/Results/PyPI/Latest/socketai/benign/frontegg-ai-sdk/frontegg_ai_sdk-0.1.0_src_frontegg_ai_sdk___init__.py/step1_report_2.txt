  "purpose": "This code provides a Python SDK for interacting with Frontegg AI Agents, mainly exporting core components for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from the '.core' package: FronteggAiClient, FronteggAiClientConfig, Environment, setup_logger.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code primarily re-exports imported components without handling untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is mostly static and re-exporting modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The version number is straightforward, and the code lacks dynamic execution or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that re-exports classes and functions from a core package, defining a version and export list. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious behaviors. It does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The structure is standard for Python SDK packages.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign, straightforward SDK component that re-exports core functionalities. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks in this code.",
