{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an SDK interface for interacting with Frontegg AI Agents, mainly exporting core components for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports core components from a local module (.core). No external data inputs are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code only re-exports imported components; there are no data flows or untrusted data sources present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The versioning and exports follow standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that re-exports core classes and functions for an SDK. It contains only import statements, version info, and export declarations. No data input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is visible. It appears to be a benign, boilerplate module designed for package export.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package interface with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It functions as a clean, minimal setup for SDK component exposure.",
