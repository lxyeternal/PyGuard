{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python SDK for interacting with Frontegg AI Agents, primarily to re-export core components and set package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module metadata and imports core components from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input, execute external commands, or handle sensitive data insecurely.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows involving untrusted sources; the code mainly sets up exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a package initialization file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports components from a relative core module, defines package version, and specifies exported symbols. It does not include any dynamic execution, user input handling, network activity, or credential management. The structure and syntax are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package initialization script with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply re-exports core components for the SDK. Overall, it is safe.",
