{
  "purpose": "A minimal Python module that re-exports core components from a local package for SDK initialization.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .core module, version string assignment, __all__ list definition",
  "sinks": "No data inputs, outputs, or external data flows; no network or file operations",
  "flows": "N/A, static code with no data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package initializer that imports specific classes/functions, sets a version, and defines exports. It contains no dynamic execution, user input handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK module with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
