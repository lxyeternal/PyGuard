{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python SDK package 'frontegg-ai-sdk' including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Code reads static strings for package metadata, reads 'README.md' for long description, and imports 'setuptools' functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input; dependencies are specified for installation.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly sets configuration for package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The reading of 'README.md' is standard, and dependencies appear typical for a Python SDK.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard 'setuptools' for packaging, specifies dependencies, and reads a README file for long description. No code injection, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The dependencies listed are common Python packages and appear safe. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected. The structure follows common Python package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a normal package configuration for a Python SDK. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. All components are standard for such setup scripts.",
