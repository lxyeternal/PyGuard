  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python SDK package named 'frontegg-ai-sdk'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data, including package metadata, dependencies, and description files.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; no data leaks or unsafe operations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or external effects; configuration data is static.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with no unusual code, obfuscated parts, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads a README file for the long description, which is typical. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution present. Dependencies are standard Python packages, and there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a conventional configuration for packaging a Python SDK. It contains no malicious code or security risks.",
