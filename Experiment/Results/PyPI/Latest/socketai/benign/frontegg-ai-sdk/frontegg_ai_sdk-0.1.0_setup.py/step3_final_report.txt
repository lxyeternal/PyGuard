  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python SDK 'frontegg-ai-sdk'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, specifying dependencies, static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input processed.",
  "flows": "Static data from variables and file read; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md') without exception handling; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads a local README file without exception handling, which is common but minor. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input processing occurs. Dependencies are typical for an SDK. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports agree on benign behavior, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks. The minor omission of exception handling does not constitute a security concern, only a coding practice note.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The minor issue of missing exception handling on file read does not elevate security risk. Overall, the package is safe for use.",
