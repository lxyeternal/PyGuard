{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python SDK package called 'frontegg-ai-sdk'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package description from 'README.md' and specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted external input or data; no data leaks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or external outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard setup script with no suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to configure package metadata and dependencies, reading a markdown file for description. It specifies typical dependencies for a Python SDK without any external inputs, user data, or network communication within this script. The dependencies include requests, httpx, and others which are standard for HTTP interactions. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely configures the package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
