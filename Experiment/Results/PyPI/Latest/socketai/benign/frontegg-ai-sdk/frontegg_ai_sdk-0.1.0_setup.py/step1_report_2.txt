{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'frontegg-ai-sdk', specifying metadata and dependencies for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'README.md' file for the long description and uses hardcoded package metadata such as name, version, author, and URL.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure actions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The only data flow involves reading the 'README.md' file content into the long_description parameter during setup; package dependencies are statically listed.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a straightforward setup configuration with no suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behavior. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard 'setuptools' functions to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads the 'README.md' file to include a long description, which is typical in setup scripts. Dependencies are explicitly listed, and no untrusted inputs or malicious code execution is detected. The structure and content adhere to common setup practices. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
