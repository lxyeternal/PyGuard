{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python SDK package called 'frontegg-ai-sdk'.",
  "sources": "Reads package information, version, description, author info, and requirements; opens 'README.md' to read long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is sent or processed in a way that could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Reads package metadata and dependencies; opens local file 'README.md' for content.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() to read 'README.md' without exception handling, which could cause errors if file is missing, but this is common in setup scripts and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, specifies package info, dependencies, and reads a local markdown file for description. No untrusted input processing, no network operations, no embedded code execution. The use of open() without error handling is typical but does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign and typical for Python package setup files.",
