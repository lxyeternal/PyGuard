  "purpose": "Evaluate the supply chain security of the open source Python SDK code, focusing on malicious behavior, anomalies, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, dynamic schema creation, runtime package installation, JWT handling, external API calls.",
  "sinks": "API endpoints, JWT tokens, environment variables, dynamic model references, package installation commands.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence base URLs and override flags -> dynamic schema references influence model creation -> runtime package installation occurs during tool adaptation -> JWT tokens are refreshed and used for API calls.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual runtime installation of 'nest_asyncio' within '_adapt_mcp_tool_to_crewai_tool', dynamic creation of models from JSON schemas, environment variable override for staging, multiple dynamic behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a standard SDK client for AI tools, managing tokens, tool listing, and invocation. The dynamic installation of 'nest_asyncio' during runtime is unconventional but not malicious; it could be exploited if environment variables or schemas are maliciously manipulated. The dynamic creation of models from JSON schemas introduces potential attack vectors if schemas are maliciously crafted, possibly leading to code injection or execution. The environment variable 'FRONTEGG_STAGING_OVERRIDE' influences base URLs and is a common pattern but could be misused. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. External API calls and JWT handling appear legitimate. Overall, the code exhibits dynamic behaviors that could be exploited but lacks active malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The SDK code is a legitimate client with some dynamic behaviors (runtime package installation, schema-based model creation) that could be exploited if inputs are malicious. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads is detected. The main concern is the potential attack surface introduced by dynamic schema processing and environment manipulation, which warrants cautious deployment and input validation.",
