  "conclusion": "The SDK code is a legitimate client with some dynamic behaviors (runtime package installation, schema-based model creation) that could be exploited if inputs are malicious. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads is detected. The main concern is the potential attack surface introduced by dynamic schema processing and environment manipulation, which warrants cautious deployment and input validation."
