{
  "purpose": "Provides a standardized logging setup for the SDK, configuring loggers with optional console and file handlers.",
  "sources": "Parameters: name, level, format_string, stream_handler, file_handler; sys.stdout for console output; file path for file handler.",
  "sinks": "Log messages written to stdout or specified log file; no external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Logger configuration flows from parameters to handlers; log messages flow from code execution to handlers and output destinations.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward. Minor potential misuse of user-controlled file path exists but is typical in configurable logging modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, transparent implementation of a logging setup function. It removes existing handlers to prevent duplication, then adds console and/or file handlers based on parameters. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The only concern is that the 'file_handler' parameter is user-controlled, which could lead to misconfiguration or misuse, but this is common in logging configurations and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented logging configuration module with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor risk associated with user-controlled file paths is acknowledged but does not constitute a security threat. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0. The risk score is minimal (around 0.2 in the most cautious report), justified by potential misconfiguration rather than malicious behavior.",
