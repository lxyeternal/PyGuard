{
  "purpose": "This module provides a standardized setup for logging within an SDK, allowing configurable logging levels, formats, and output destinations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as 'name', 'level', 'format_string', 'stream_handler', and 'file_handler'. It also reads from 'sys.stdout' for console output and from 'file_handler' path for file output.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing logs to a file specified by 'file_handler' and outputting to stdout. These do not inherently lead to malicious activity but could be misused if log files contain sensitive data or if logs are redirected maliciously.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function arguments into the logger configuration, with untrusted inputs (e.g., 'file_handler') potentially affecting where logs are stored, but no unsafe code execution or data exfiltration occurs within this module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard logging library functions, removes existing handlers before adding new ones, and defaults to a safe format. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to set up a logger with configurable parameters. It correctly removes existing handlers to avoid duplication and adds console and/or file handlers based on inputs. All inputs are used in a safe manner, with no indication of malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code is straightforward and employs best practices for logging configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign logging setup module with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. It correctly manages logger handlers and offers flexible configuration without exposing sensitive information or executing harmful actions.",
