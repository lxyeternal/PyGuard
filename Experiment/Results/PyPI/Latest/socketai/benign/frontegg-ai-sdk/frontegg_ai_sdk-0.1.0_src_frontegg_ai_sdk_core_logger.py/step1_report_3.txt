{
  "purpose": "Provides a standard logging setup for an SDK, enabling consistent logging configuration.",
  "sources": "User or system code calling setup_logger, specifically the arguments for logger name, level, format_string, stream_handler, and file_handler.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted input could influence format_string, filename in file_handler, or logger configuration if those inputs are externally controlled, potentially leading to log injection or file path exploits.",
  "flows": "Inputs (name, level, format_string, stream_handler, file_handler) -> logger configuration -> logging output to console or file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors observed. No use of external network, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward logger setup function with configurable parameters, defaulting to standard logging practices. It properly removes existing handlers before adding new ones to prevent duplicate logs. The use of sys.stdout and optional file path for file handler is standard. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors. No external network connections, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured logger configuration module intended for SDK use. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
