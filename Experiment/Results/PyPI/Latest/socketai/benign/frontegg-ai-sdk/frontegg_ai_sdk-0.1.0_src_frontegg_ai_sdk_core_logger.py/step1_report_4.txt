{
  "purpose": "To provide a standardized setup for logging within an SDK, allowing configurable log output to console and/or file.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function arguments such as 'name', 'level', 'format_string', 'stream_handler', and 'file_handler'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code writes logs to stdout or a specified file, both controlled via arguments.",
  "flows": "Inputs (configuration parameters) influence logger setup; handlers output logs to console or file based on these parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code correctly removes existing handlers before adding new ones, avoiding duplicate logs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to create and configure a Python logger with flexible options for output format, level, and destination. It uses standard library modules with no external or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or malicious patterns are observed. The default logger is initialized with standard settings, typical for SDK logging infrastructure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup module with no malicious intent or security risks. It correctly manages handlers and provides configurable logging. No suspicious or malicious behavior identified.",
