{
  "purpose": "Provides a standardized logging setup for the SDK, allowing configurable log output to console and/or file.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters from function arguments and environment (via sys.stdout for console output).",
  "sinks": "Outputs logs to console or file as specified, which could potentially be exploited if file path is malicious.",
  "flows": "Configuration inputs (name, level, format_string, stream_handler, file_handler) flow into logger setup, resulting in log messages being output to specified handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation. Usage of standard Python logging library with configurable handlers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to set up a logger with optional file and console handlers. It ensures handlers are reset to prevent duplicates. The default logger is configured with standard parameters. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The only potential security consideration is that the 'file_handler' argument could specify a path that may be exploited if misused, but this is a typical pattern for configurable logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not include malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage, only conventional logging configuration. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected.",
