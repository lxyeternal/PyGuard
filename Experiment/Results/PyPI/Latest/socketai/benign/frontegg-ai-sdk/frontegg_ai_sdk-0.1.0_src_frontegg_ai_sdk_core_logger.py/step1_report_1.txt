{
  "purpose": "Provides a standardized logging setup for the SDK to facilitate consistent log management.",
  "sources": "Imports from logging, sys, and typing modules; function parameters for logger configuration; reading the file path for file_handler.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is being written or transmitted outside the local environment.",
  "flows": "Logger configuration parameters flow into the setup_logger function, which then configures handlers based on these parameters; data flows from input parameters to handlers and eventually to output streams or files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code handles logging setup securely without external data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to set up a logger with options for console and file output, removing existing handlers to prevent duplication. It uses standard Python logging practices without any insecure or malicious behavior. The setup is straightforward and does not include external data transmission or any suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs its intended purpose securely and transparently.",
