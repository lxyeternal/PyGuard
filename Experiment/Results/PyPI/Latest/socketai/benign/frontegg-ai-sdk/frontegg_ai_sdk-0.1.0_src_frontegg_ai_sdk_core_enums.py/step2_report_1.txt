  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `enum` module.\n- Defines an `Environment` enum with five members, each mapping to a URL string.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, and contains no dynamic or external data.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- **Are there any issues?**  \n  No. All reports agree that the code is benign, static, and standard for configuration purposes.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Logical flaws?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the code as a simple enum with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Misinterpretations?**  \n  No, all reports seem accurate.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n- These scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since all reports assign zero to malware and security risk, and the code is static with no external inputs, higher scores are unjustified.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n### Challenging claims based on assumptions:\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all agree on benign nature.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a straightforward, static enumeration for environment URLs with no malicious or suspicious features. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep all scores at zero.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's characteristics.",
