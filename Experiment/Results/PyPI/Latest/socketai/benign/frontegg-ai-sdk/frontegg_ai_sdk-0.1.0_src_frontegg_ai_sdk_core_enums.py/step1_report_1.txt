  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different environment URLs used in the application.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data is hardcoded within the enum class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output involving untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from source to sink exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "All data is hardcoded; no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module and defines an Enum class 'Environment' with five environment URLs. The implementation appears straightforward, with no dynamic elements, external inputs, or suspicious constructs. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code serves a typical purpose of environment configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign enumeration of environment URLs with no malicious or suspicious features. It does not pose security risks.",
