{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for environment URLs used in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code imports the enum module and defines class variables with string values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmission points are present.",
  "flows": "The enum class simply stores static string values; there are no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard library features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module, then creates an Environment enum with five members representing different geographic regions with associated URLs. There are no external inputs, data leaks, or malicious constructs. The code appears to be part of a configuration or settings module for environment-specific endpoints, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for defining environment-specific constants. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
