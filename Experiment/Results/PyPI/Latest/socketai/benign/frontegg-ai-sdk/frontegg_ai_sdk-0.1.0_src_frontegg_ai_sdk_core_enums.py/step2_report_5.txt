  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a simple enum class defining environment URLs.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, and contains no dynamic or suspicious elements.\n- No external data sources, no data flows, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious behavior are identified.\n- The scores assigned (obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The code matches the description: a straightforward enum with environment URLs.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent; no logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The reasoning that the code is benign and serves as configuration is sound.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** correct, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score (0):** correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk (0):** correct, no vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- None are necessary; the code is benign.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is purely configuration, which is accurate.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the conclusion is justified.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the code and the reports, I concur with the evaluations. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard enum definition for environment URLs, with no signs of malicious or suspicious features. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified.",
