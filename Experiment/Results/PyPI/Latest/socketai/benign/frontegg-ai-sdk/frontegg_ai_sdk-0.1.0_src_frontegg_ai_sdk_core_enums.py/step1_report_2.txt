{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different environment URLs, likely used for configuration or environment-specific logic.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code only defines static enum values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not perform any data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow as the code only defines an enum class with hardcoded values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code appears straightforward with standard enum usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple enum class 'Environment' with country-specific domain strings. It does not read any input, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code. The static nature of enum values indicates typical configuration data. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration enumeration for environment URLs without any malicious intent or security issues.",
