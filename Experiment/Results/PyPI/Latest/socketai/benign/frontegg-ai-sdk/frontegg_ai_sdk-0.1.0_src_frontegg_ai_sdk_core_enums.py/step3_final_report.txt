  "purpose": "Defines environment URLs as an enumeration for configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Static enum members with hardcoded string URL values.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; code does not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment without dynamic processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module and defines an Environment enum with five members, each mapping to a static URL string. All reports correctly identify the code as a simple, static configuration construct with no external inputs, data processing, or suspicious logic. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. The code does not perform any network activity, data leaks, or dynamic operations. The analysis confirms that the code is a benign configuration snippet with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static enumeration for environment URLs with no malicious or suspicious features. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
