{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script that performs data processing, possibly involving input handling and output generation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters or external sources such as files or network (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Output or sensitive data could be written to files, console, or sent over the network (not explicitly shown).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, potentially to output sinks, but specific flows cannot be determined without detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual code constructs or malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with standard Python functions and control flow. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are evident. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical for data processing tasks. There are no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads. The overall structure does not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious activity or security risks. The code seems to serve its intended purpose without malicious modifications.",
