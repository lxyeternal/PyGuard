  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no explicit indication of malicious intent. Its purpose seems to be related to general data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function arguments, environment variables, or external files, though specific input sources are not explicitly evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of system commands if such functions are called, but no direct usage is observed in the code provided.",
  "flows": "Without explicit input/output operations in the code snippet, flow analysis is limited. There are no apparent source-to-sink data flows within the provided code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code structures, or unusual dynamic code execution are observed. The code structure appears normal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code has been reviewed comprehensively, including initial, middle, and final sections. No indicators of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity are detected. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard and benign. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access mechanisms. Overall, the code looks typical for a Python utility or data processing module.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code snippet. The code appears safe with low likelihood of malicious intent.",
