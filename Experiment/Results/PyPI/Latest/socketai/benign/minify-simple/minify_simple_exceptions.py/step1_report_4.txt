  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named MinifiedError",
  "sources": "No data input sources present",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow; class definition is isolated",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; simple class declaration, no obfuscated or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception with no additional logic, attributes, or behavior. It appears straightforward and intentionally minimal. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The class could be used for error handling in larger codebases, but on its own, it shows no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple, benign custom exception class with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is a standard pattern used for error handling.",
