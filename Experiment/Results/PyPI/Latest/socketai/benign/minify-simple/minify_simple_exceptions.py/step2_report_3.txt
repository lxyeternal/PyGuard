  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition with no data input/output, no external interactions, and no complex logic.\n   - The code snippet itself is just a class inheriting from Exception, with no additional methods, attributes, or code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent in the reasoning.\n   - They correctly note the absence of obfuscation, malware, or suspicious activity.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1.0 (fully confident)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - Malware: 0 (no malware)\n     - SecurityRisk: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a class definition with no malicious or suspicious features, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - The reports are justified in assigning a zero risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, so this is accurate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to observable facts.\n   - The conclusion that the code is benign is well-supported.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and match the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- The code snippet is a straightforward class definition with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The reports are thorough, accurate, and consistent.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Own Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (clear, simple class)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports are accurate and well-reasoned. No score adjustments are necessary.",
