  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the issues in the code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a minimal class definition: `class MinifiedError(Exception): pass`.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no data input/output, external interactions, or complex logic.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies are present.\n   - The class is likely used as a custom exception in a larger codebase.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, minimal, and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The conclusion that the code is harmless is justified based on the provided snippet.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1.0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0 for malware and security risk, and the code is benign, no justification exists for higher scores.\n   - The code is a standard class declaration with no malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code contains nothing malicious—no obfuscated code, no external calls, no suspicious patterns.\n   - Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly state that this is a simple class definition with no vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a straightforward, benign custom exception class with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate, and their scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
