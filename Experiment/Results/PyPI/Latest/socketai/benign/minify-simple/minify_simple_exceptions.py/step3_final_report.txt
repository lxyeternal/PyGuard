  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definition inheriting from Exception, no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class is used for raising or catching exceptions within code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class inheriting from Exception with no methods or attributes. It does not perform any data processing, external calls, or obfuscation. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or anomalies are present. The class is likely used as a custom exception in larger codebases. The benign nature is confirmed by multiple reviews, with all scores indicating no malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions support a conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal custom exception class with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports and scores are consistent and appropriate.",
