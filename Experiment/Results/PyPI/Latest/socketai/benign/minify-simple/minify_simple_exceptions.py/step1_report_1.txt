  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named MinifiedError.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; code only defines a class.",

  "flows": "No data flow paths present.",
  "anomalies": "Simple class definition with no complex or unusual features; no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a minimal custom exception class inheriting from Exception, likely used for specific error handling in a larger codebase. It contains no logic beyond class declaration and does not include any suspicious behavior, external calls, or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and appears to be a simple class definition with no malicious intent.",
