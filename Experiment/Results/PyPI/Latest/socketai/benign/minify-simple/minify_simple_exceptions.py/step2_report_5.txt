  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of the code in the codebase:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward class definition with no external data input, processing, or communication. The class is a minimal custom exception inheriting from `Exception`.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, simple, and lacks any suspicious or malicious features. There are no logical errors or inconsistencies in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 or 0.0 — consistent, as no obfuscation is present.  \n   - **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious activity.  \n   - **Security risk score:** 0 — consistent, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports agree on the benign nature and lack of malicious features, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code is a simple class definition with no suspicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any external calls, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the reports:**  \n   All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\nGiven the simplicity of the code, there is no reason to assign any risk or malware scores above zero. The code appears to be a standard, harmless class definition used for custom error handling.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate.  \n- No modifications needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0**.",
