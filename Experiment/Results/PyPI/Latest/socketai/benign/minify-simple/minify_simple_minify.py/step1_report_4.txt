  "purpose": "This code provides functions to minify code files (HTML, CSS, JS) based on the filename extension or specified language, and saves the minified output to a file.",
  "sources": "Reads input filename, reads file content with open(in_filename, 'r'), reads file extension to determine language.",
  "sinks": "Writes minified code to output file with open(_output_path, 'w').",
  "flows": "Input filename -> read file content -> minify code -> write minified code to output filename.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. Use of standard library os and open is normal. The function performs file I/O with no untrusted data manipulation beyond reading filenames and contents.",
  "analysis": "The code reads file contents based on provided filenames, determines language from filename extension or argument, minifies code using external minify_html library, and writes the output to a file. The filename suffix handling checks for existing suffix and appends if necessary. No suspicious code or backdoors detected. No network operations, no obfuscated code, and no handling of sensitive data beyond file I/O. No external inputs beyond filenames and parameters are used. The minify_html library usage appears straightforward. Overall, the code is a standard file minification utility with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard minification tasks with proper handling of filenames, suffixes, and file I/O. No malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are present. It appears to be a safe utility for code minification.",
