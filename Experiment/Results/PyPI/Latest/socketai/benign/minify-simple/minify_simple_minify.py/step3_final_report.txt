  "purpose": "Utility for minifying code snippets or files in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, based on filename extension or explicit language parameter.",
  "sources": "Reads input code from files specified by filename; infers language from filename extension or uses provided language parameter.",
  "sinks": "Writes minified code to output files; potential for filename manipulation issues if filenames are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> minifies code based on language -> writes minified code to output file.",
  "anomalies": "Filename suffix handling could be vulnerable if filename is shorter than suffix length; no validation for content-language consistency.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file I/O and minification using an external library. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected. The suffix check may have a minor edge case issue but does not impact security. External library usage is standard; no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution present. The scoring of malware and obfuscation as zero is appropriate. The low security risk score reflects minimal inherent risks in file handling, which is typical for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility for minifying files with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior. Minor robustness improvements could be made in filename suffix handling, but overall, the code is secure and well-structured.",
