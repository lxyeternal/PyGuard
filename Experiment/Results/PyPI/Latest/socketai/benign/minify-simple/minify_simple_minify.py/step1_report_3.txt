  "purpose": "This code provides functions for minifying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and for processing files to generate minified versions.",
  "sources": "Reads input filenames, reads file contents from disk, and derives language type from filename extension.",
  "sinks": "Writes minified code to output files; potentially overwriting existing files.",
  "flows": "Filename input -> file read -> minify -> file write to output filename.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads input filenames, derives the language based on file extension, reads file content, minifies content using an external library, and writes output to a specified location. The external library 'minify_html' is used, which performs standard minification. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or network activity. The filename manipulation functions are straightforward and do not introduce security issues. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. Error handling is limited to raising exceptions if the language is unsupported or suffix logic is violated.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for minifying files with no malicious intent or behavior. It securely handles file input/output and performs expected operations without suspicious side effects. No indicators of malware or security risks detected.",
