  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility for minifying files with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior. Minor robustness improvements could be made in filename suffix handling, but overall, the code is secure and well-structured."
