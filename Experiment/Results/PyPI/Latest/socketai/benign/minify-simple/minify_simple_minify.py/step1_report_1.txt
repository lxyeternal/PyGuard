{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for minifying code snippets or files in different programming languages (JS, CSS, HTML) and managing file naming conventions for minified files.",
  "sources": "Reading input files via open(in_filename, 'r') and possibly reading filenames for extension parsing",
  "sinks": "Writing minified code to output files via open(_output_path, 'w')",
  "flows": "Read file content -> Minify based on language -> Write minified content to output file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. Usage of filename manipulation and extension parsing appears standard. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file input/output operations, infers language from filenames, and minifies code using the minify_html module. All operations are standard file handling and string manipulation routines. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The exception handling and filename suffix logic appear conventional. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware signatures detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical utility for code minification and filename management without any malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external minify_html for actual minification, which is a common practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior identified.",
