{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to minify HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files, handling file input/output and filename processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input files specified by 'in_filename', potentially untrusted filenames, and reads their contents.",
  "sinks": "Writes minified code to output files, potentially overwriting existing files; no untrusted data flows into network or system commands.",
  "flows": "Reads file content from 'in_filename', processes via 'minify', then writes to 'out_filename' or derived filename.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. Filename handling appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file reading and writing for minification purposes, using a third-party 'minify_html' library. The filename functions parse extensions and add suffixes, with checks to prevent overwriting minified files. No user input is directly used in dangerous system commands. No network activity, encryption, or data exfiltration code is present. The content of the minify function relies on a third-party library which is assumed safe, and no suspicious or malicious logic is evident in the implementation. The code validates file extensions against supported languages and raises appropriate exceptions for unsupported types.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard minification utility with proper handling of filenames and extensions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It operates safely within its scope, with no evident supply chain or runtime attack vectors.",
