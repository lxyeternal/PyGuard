  "purpose": "A command-line utility to minify web files such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, supporting recursive directory processing and customizable output options.",
  "sources": "User-supplied path argument, command-line arguments for language, suffix, and output filenames.",
  "sinks": "Calls to minify_file, print statements, exception handling printing error messages.",
  "flows": "User inputs (path, options) → glob or direct file list → minify_file processing → output filenames printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of try-except around minify_file with generic exception handling is standard. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical CLI utility that leverages a minify_file function imported from a local module. It processes input paths, optionally recursively, and handles multiple files or a single file with output options. There is no indication of malicious payloads, network activity, or data leakage. The code’s structure is clear and does not contain obfuscated patterns. The only potential concern is the generic exception handling, which could hide underlying issues, but this is standard practice in CLI tools.\n\nOverall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign minification utility without malicious behavior or security risks. It processes files locally, with no suspicious network or privacy violations detected.",
