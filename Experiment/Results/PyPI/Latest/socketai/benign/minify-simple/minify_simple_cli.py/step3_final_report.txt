  "purpose": "A CLI utility for minifying web files such as JS, CSS, and HTML, processing individual files or directories with optional recursion and output customization.",
  "sources": "Input path provided via command-line arguments; glob pattern matching for directories; external 'minify_file' function from 'minify' module.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'minify_file' which processes files; output filenames generated and printed; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input path -> glob matching -> 'minify_file' processing -> output filenames -> print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Exception handling is broad but standard; reliance on external 'minify' module assumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool that processes files or directories for minification. It uses standard argument parsing, globbing, and calls an external minify function. No network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. Exception handling is broad but typical for CLI utilities. External dependencies are assumed legitimate. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard utility for minifying web files. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code is transparent and well-structured, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
