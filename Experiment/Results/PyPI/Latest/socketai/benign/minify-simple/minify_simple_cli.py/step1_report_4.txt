{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to minify web files such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, either individually or recursively within directories.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments (path, output filename, language, suffix, recursion flag, suffix check flag).",
  "sinks": "The function 'minify_file' processes input files, potentially involving file I/O operations. 'print' statements output filenames and errors.",
  "flows": "User input -> argument parsing -> file path resolution -> minify_file calls -> output filenames",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; standard use of libraries. No external network or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script takes user input for file paths and options, then resolves those paths and processes each file with 'minify_file'. It handles multiple files and potential exceptions gracefully. No signs of data leakage, network activity, or malicious code are present. The code structure is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for minifying web files. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It relies on external 'minify' module for core processing, which appears standard. Overall, it is safe based on the provided code.",
