{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to minify web files such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, by processing input files or directories, and generating minified output files.",
  "sources": "Reads input paths provided via command-line arguments, and potentially reads files within directories when recursive option is enabled.",
  "sinks": "Calls external function 'minify_file' which processes input files and produces output filenames. Also prints output filenames to the console.",
  "flows": "User input (file/directory paths) -> glob search (for directories) -> minify_file processing -> output filenames printed to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious environment variable usage, no network activity or system modifications observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is present. Exception handling is broad but only logs errors.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard libraries for file handling and command-line argument parsing. It relies on an imported 'minify_file' function, which is not detailed here. The code processes user input paths, with options for recursive directory traversal and output customization. It safely handles exceptions during minification and avoids unsafe operations. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors are detected. The code appears to be a typical command-line utility for file processing with no external network or system access beyond file operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward file minification utility with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. The overall security risk is minimal.",
