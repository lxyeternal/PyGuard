{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to minify web files such as JS, CSS, and HTML, processing individual files or directories, with options for recursive processing and output naming.",
  "sources": "Reads input path(s) specified via command-line arguments; uses glob to gather files when directories are provided.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'minify_file' function, which likely performs file rewriting or output creation; standard output for filenames.",
  "flows": "Input paths -> glob collects files -> minify_file processes each file -> output filenames printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file handling and minification tasks, invoking a 'minify_file' function whose implementation is external and not shown here. The script handles multiple files, directories, and command-line options safely, with error handling for exceptions. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system harm is evident. The only external dependency is the 'minify' module, which appears to be for legitimate code minification. No indications of malware or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a benign utility for minifying web files. It does not contain any malicious intent or suspicious behavior based on the provided code. The overall security risk is very low.",
