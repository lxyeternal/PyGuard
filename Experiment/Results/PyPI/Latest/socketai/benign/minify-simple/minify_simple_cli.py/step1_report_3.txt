{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to minify web files such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML by processing individual files or directories, with options for output filename, language specification, recursion, and suffix handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input path(s) provided via command-line arguments; potentially reads files or directories on the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Calls to minify_file function, which presumably performs file processing and output; also prints filenames to stdout.",
  "flows": "User provides input path -> script determines files to process -> minify_file is called for each file -> output filenames are generated and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. No unsafe eval, exec, or network operations present. The code appears to rely on external 'minify' module, which is not provided, but nothing suspicious is indicated here.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and well-defined flow control for processing files and directories. It safely handles command-line arguments, and exceptions are caught during minification, preventing crashes. No apparent data leaks, malicious network calls, or backdoors are present. The module 'minify_file' is assumed to perform safe minification, but without its implementation, no further assumptions can be made. Overall, the script appears to be a typical file processing utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward file minification tool with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely manages inputs, handles errors gracefully, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
