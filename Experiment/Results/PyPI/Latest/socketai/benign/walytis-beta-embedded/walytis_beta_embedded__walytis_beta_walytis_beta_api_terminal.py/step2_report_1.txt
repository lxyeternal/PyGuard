  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as an API for blockchain management, reading request bytes, JSON payloads, and indirectly environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly describes data flow from requests to handlers, with responses in JSON. No anomalies detected.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious logic. Exception handling is broad but standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk, high confidence, malware score 0, obfuscated 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code appears benign, with no malicious signs. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly states the API functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes data flow and external module reliance.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior. Exception handling is broad but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Consistent with a low-risk assessment, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No issues found; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the API's role.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly details data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk, high confidence, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the API's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Describes data flow accurately.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. Broad exception handling is noted but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately states the API role.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly describes data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No evidence of malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. Recognizes that untrusted JSON data is processed but not maliciously.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** Uniformly low (~0.2), reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Step: Overall Estimation\n\n**Given the detailed reviews:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code, no suspicious network activity, no backdoors)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (standard API code with external dependencies, minimal inherent risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the observed code.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \n- No further action needed based on the provided code and reports.\n- The external `walytis_beta` module's trustworthiness remains an external concern but isn't part of this code review.\n\n**Work completed.**",
