{
  "purpose": "Rebuilds and reinstalls the Python package by deleting build caches and egg-info directories, then running pip install for the current package.",
  "sources": "Reads its own file path (__file__), accesses and deletes specific directories (walytis_beta_api.egg-info, build), and executes pip.main() to run pip install.",
  "sinks": "Executes pip.main() to install the package, which can modify the environment and system packages.",
  "flows": "Determines current directory -> deletes cache directories -> calls pip.main() to reinstall the package from current directory.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated pip API (pip.main()), which is not recommended and can cause unpredictable behavior; hardcoded directory names; no input validation or user confirmation before deleting directories.",
  "analysis": "The script performs local directory cleanup and reinstalls the package using pip's internal API, which is outdated. It does not handle user input or external data; its actions are limited to filesystem operations and subprocess invocation. No hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or obfuscated code are present. The use of 'pip.main()' may pose risks if pip's internal API changes, but in itself, it does not indicate malicious intent. The script could be used maliciously if altered to delete other directories or run arbitrary commands, but as-is, it appears to be a legitimate package rebuild utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to clean build artifacts and reinstall the package, with no evident malicious behavior or backdoors. The use of deprecated pip API is a concern for maintainability but does not indicate malware or malicious intent. No security risks are apparent beyond standard filesystem and subprocess operations.",
