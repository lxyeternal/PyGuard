  "purpose": "Rebuilds and reinstalls the Python package by deleting build artifacts and running pip install.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath(__file__), list of directories to delete, current directory, pip.main() command",
  "sinks": "shutil.rmtree() for directory deletion, pip.main() for package installation",
  "flows": "current_dir -> shutil.rmtree() for each directory, current_dir -> pip.main() to perform installation",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated pip API (pip.main), deletes specific directories unconditionally, runs pip install with --break-system-packages which can modify system-wide packages",
  "analysis": "The script deletes specific build and egg-info directories to force a clean rebuild, then runs pip install with a flag that allows breaking system packages. It uses os and shutil modules properly but relies on deprecated pip API, which is not recommended. The use of --break-system-packages can be risky as it may modify system or environment packages, potentially affecting system stability or security. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior; the script appears to perform standard rebuild and install procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for package rebuilding and installation, with no evidence of malicious intent. However, it uses deprecated API and includes potentially risky flags that can affect system stability. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate but somewhat risky build script, not malware.",
