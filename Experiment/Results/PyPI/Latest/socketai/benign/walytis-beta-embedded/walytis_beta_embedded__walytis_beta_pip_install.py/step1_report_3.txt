  "purpose": "Rebuilds and installs the Python package by deleting cache and build directories, then executing pip install.",
  "sources": "Current directory path, user environment for pip installation",
  "sinks": "Execution of pip.main() which runs pip install command",
  "flows": "Current directory → deletion of specific folders → pip.main() execution to reinstall package",
  "anomalies": "Uses pip.main(), which is deprecated; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious commands; deletion of build artifacts is typical for rebuilding",
  "analysis": "The script deletes build artifacts and egg-info directories before calling pip.main() to reinstall the package. The use of pip.main() is deprecated but not inherently malicious. There are no hardcoded secrets, no code injection, and no external data handling that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity. The script's behavior appears to be a straightforward rebuild and reinstall process with no suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for package rebuilding and installation. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, but uses deprecated pip functions. It is safe and not suspicious.",
