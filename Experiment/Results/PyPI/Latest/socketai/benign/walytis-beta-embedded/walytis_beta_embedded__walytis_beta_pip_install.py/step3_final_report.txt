{
  "purpose": "This script deletes specific build directories and reinstalls the package using pip, primarily for rebuilding purposes.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads for directory existence checks and deletions; current directory path retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of pip.main() which executes pip commands that modify the environment or system packages.",
  "flows": "Directory existence checks lead to deletions, followed by pip installation via pip.main().",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated pip.main() API; hardcoded directory names; no input validation; use of '--break-system-packages' flag.",
  "analysis": "The code performs filesystem cleanup and reinstalls the package, which is typical for build scripts. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments are present. The use of pip.main() is outdated but not malicious. The '--break-system-packages' flag can modify system-wide packages, posing a risk if run with elevated privileges, but this is a known operational risk, not malicious activity. No external data handling or network activity is observed. The script's behavior is straightforward and intended for development or build automation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for rebuilding and reinstalling a Python package. It does not contain malicious payloads or behaviors. The main concerns are the use of deprecated pip API and potential system impact due to directory deletion and system package modification, especially when run with elevated privileges. Overall, it poses a low security risk and no malware threat.",
