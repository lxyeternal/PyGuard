  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for blockchain-related errors in the Walytis_Beta project.",
  "sources": "None, the code only defines exception classes with docstrings.",
  "sinks": "None, no data processing, input/output, or external connections present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the classes are simple exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains straightforward custom exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings. It does not include any data handling, external calls, or complex logic. The classes are standard for Python exception handling and do not exhibit obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely definitional, establishing custom exceptions for blockchain error states. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
