{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for blockchain error states.",
  "sources": "Class definitions of BlockchainTerminatedError and BlockchainNotInitialised, containing only docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes are standalone definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and simple.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with descriptive docstrings. No logic, data handling, external calls, or obfuscation are present. The code is clear, standard, and serves as error indicators for blockchain states. No suspicious patterns, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks or malicious intent. The reports accurately reflect this, and the scores are justified.",
