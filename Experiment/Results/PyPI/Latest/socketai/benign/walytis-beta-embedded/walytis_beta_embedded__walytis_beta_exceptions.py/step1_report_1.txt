  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions related to blockchain states for error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception message strings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no untrusted data handling or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only declares exception classes without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present; straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code declares two custom exception classes for blockchain-related errors. The classes are simple and inherit from Exception without additional logic, data handling, or external calls. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated logic, or malicious behavior are evident. The exception messages are descriptive but standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard custom exception definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward and does not contain any anomalous or suspicious elements.",
