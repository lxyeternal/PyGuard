  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code only defines two custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and serves its purpose as error indicators.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is simple, benign, and free of anomalies or malicious patterns. No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity. These scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports indicate no malicious behavior, the overall security risk should remain at 0. The code's purpose is purely definitional, with no external data handling or logic that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as simple exception class definitions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a straightforward, benign set of custom exception definitions related to blockchain states. There is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk present.\n\n**My Estimated Scores**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThese reflect the code's simplicity and lack of any malicious or risky elements.",
