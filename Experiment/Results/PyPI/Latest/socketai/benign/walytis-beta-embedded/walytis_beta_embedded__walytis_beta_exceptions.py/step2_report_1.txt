  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code consists solely of defining two custom exception classes:\n     ```python\n     class BlockchainTerminatedError(Exception):\n         \"\"\"When a method is called on a blockchain that is shutting down.\"\"\"\n\n     class BlockchainNotInitialised(Exception):\n         \"\"\"When a method is called on a blockchain isn't yet initialised.\"\"\"\n     ```\n   - There are no signs of code anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - The classes are straightforward, inherit from `Exception`, and contain only descriptive docstrings.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports uniformly agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of suspicious elements.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n   - The assessments correctly identify the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The `confidence` scores are all 1, which is justified due to the straightforwardness and clarity.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n   - No potential vulnerabilities, malicious code, or security concerns are present.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious intent.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports base their conclusions on the code's content, which is simple class definitions.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about hidden behavior.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct, no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct, code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct, no security risks)\n\n### My Reasoned Estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Final Scores:**\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the consensus in the reports.",
