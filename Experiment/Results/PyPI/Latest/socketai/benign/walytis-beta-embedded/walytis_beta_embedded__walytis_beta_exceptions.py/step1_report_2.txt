  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to blockchain operation states.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only class definitions and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to untrusted sources; no data processing or external calls.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are simple exception definitions with no logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes for blockchain states: 'BlockchainTerminatedError' and 'BlockchainNotInitialised'. Both classes inherit from Python's base Exception class and contain only docstrings describing their intended use. There are no external data reads, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward, serves a clear purpose, and lacks any behaviors indicative of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign definition of custom exceptions for blockchain state management. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
