  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code consists solely of two simple exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings.\n- No logic, data handling, external calls, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- The code is straightforward and aligns with typical Python exception class definitions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious elements.\n- No report mentions any overlooked security concern or potential vulnerability.\n- The reports correctly identify the absence of obfuscation, external data handling, or complex logic.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the straightforward code.\n- Confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), justified by the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify higher risk scores**\n\n- Since the code is purely exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n- The uniform zero scores are appropriate.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge claims based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made, so no challenge is necessary.\n\n**Step 6: Consistency of scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no security issues.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
