  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to blockchain operations in Walytis_Beta.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; exception classes are defined statically.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or input/output flow; only class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of custom exception class definitions without any suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines two custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings. There are no data handling, external calls, or obfuscated constructs. The classes are straightforward and serve as error indicators for blockchain shutdown and initialization issues. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident from these class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign set of custom exception definitions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
