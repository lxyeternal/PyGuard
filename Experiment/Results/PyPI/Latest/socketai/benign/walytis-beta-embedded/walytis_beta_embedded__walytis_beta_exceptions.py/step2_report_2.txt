  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \nAll reports agree that the code consists solely of simple class definitions for custom exceptions related to blockchain states. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward and serves a clear purpose.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent. No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.  \n- **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Risk Score Higher than 0.5?**:  \nNo, all scores are 0, reflecting no security risk.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \nThe reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus solely on the code's structure and purpose.\n\n6. **Score Consistency**:  \nScores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n**Overall Justification**:  \nThe code is a standard, non-malicious, straightforward implementation of custom exceptions. The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and My Own Scores:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis or details are needed.",
