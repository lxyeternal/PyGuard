  "purpose": "Processing and analyzing blockchain block ancestries, including identifying unshared ancestors and removing shared ancestors from a list of blocks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'blocks' (which can be block objects or IDs), and blockchain data accessed via blockchain.find_block().",
  "sinks": "Calls to blockchain.find_block() which accesses blockchain data; potential for data leakage or misuse if blockchain data is compromised.",
  "flows": "Input 'blocks' -> decoded or fetched via blockchain.find_block() -> used to build BlockModel objects -> ancestor analysis and list filtering based on ancestors and shared ancestry.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation. No unusual dynamic code execution, no encoding tricks. Use of standard functions for list deduplication. No malicious network or file operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements methods for analyzing blockchain block ancestors, including determining unshared ancestors and filtering out shared ancestors. It relies on blockchain.find_block() to retrieve block IDs and decode parent relationships. The process involves constructing BlockModel objects, iteratively expanding ancestor sets, and marking common ancestors. No indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations, are present. The code appears to be straightforward logic for blockchain analysis, with no suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as intended for blockchain ancestry analysis without exhibiting malicious intent or security risks. It primarily processes blockchain data to identify unique and shared ancestors among blocks. There are no signs of malware, data leaks, or backdoors. Overall, the code appears safe with low suspicion of malicious behavior.",
