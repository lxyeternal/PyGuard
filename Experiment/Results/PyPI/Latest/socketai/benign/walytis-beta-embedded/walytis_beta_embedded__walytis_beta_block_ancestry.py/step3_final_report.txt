  "purpose": "Blockchain ancestry analysis, identifying shared and unshared ancestors among blocks.",
  "sources": "Reads block IDs via function parameters, calls to blockchain.find_block(), and decode_long_id().",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks or malicious sinks detected; error logs are standard.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (block IDs or Block objects) to find_block() and decode_long_id(), then processing ancestors and updating BlockModel instances.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard blockchain ancestry computations, creating BlockModel objects, traversing ancestor relationships, and identifying unshared ancestors. It relies on external functions whose security is outside this scope. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation present. Error handling via logs is typical. The logic is straightforward and aligns with legitimate blockchain data processing. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate blockchain ancestry analysis module with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate given the reliance on external functions, but overall, the code appears safe and straightforward.",
