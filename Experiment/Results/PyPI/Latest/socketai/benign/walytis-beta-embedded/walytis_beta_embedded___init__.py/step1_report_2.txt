{
  "purpose": "This code is a library for interacting with the Walytis blockchain platform, providing APIs and utilities for blockchain management and operations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ) for configuration; imports from internal modules for API functions, exceptions, and version info.",
  "targets": "None explicitly, but potential sinks include environment variables and imported functions that could execute or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are set at the start, then functions and classes are imported for use in the application; no runtime data flow is present in the static code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.environ to set configuration parameters is standard; no hardcoded secrets or credentials are visible. No obfuscated code, malicious API calls, or suspicious imports are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules and sets environment variables relevant to the package's configuration. The environment variables are static, set at load time, and do not appear to originate from untrusted sources. Imports are from internal, presumably trusted modules, and no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling occurs within this snippet. The code is structured as a package initialization script with no apparent malicious behavior or backdoors. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward setup for a blockchain interaction library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup and import script for a blockchain API library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks based on static analysis. The setting of environment variables is static and does not pose security concerns. Overall, this appears to be a benign, well-structured library initialization code.",
