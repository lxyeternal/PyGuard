{
  "purpose": "The code is for a Python package that provides an API for interacting with the Walytis blockchain platform, including utilities, version info, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Environment variable settings (os.environ), imports from internal modules, and exceptions/versions data.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or system modifications could occur through environment variables, but these are statically assigned, not influenced by external input.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources are explicitly read; environment variables are set to fixed values. Imports and definitions do not process external data streams.",
  "anomalies": "Environment variables are set but with hardcoded values, which is normal for configuration, not suspicious. No suspicious or obfuscated code present. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets environment variables and imports various modules, classes, and constants related to the Walytis API. No data is read from user input or external sources at runtime. All environment variable assignments are static. The imports are from internal modules, with no indication of malicious code or obfuscated logic. No network activity, file manipulation, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to serve as a package interface and configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a package initialization and import module for Walytis, with no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks detected. The static environment variable assignments are typical configuration steps, not malicious or maliciously obfuscated.",
