{
  "purpose": "This code is a library for interacting with Walytis blockchain APIs and utilities, providing functions and classes for blockchain management and operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.environ) and imports functions, classes, and modules from internal package paths.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows from environment variables and imported modules that could handle untrusted data or configurations.",
  "flows": "Environment variables set at the beginning could influence subsequent imported modules; no explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The setting of environment variables is straightforward, and imports are standard.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes environment variables related to Walytis API types and modules, then imports multiple classes, functions, and exceptions from internal packages. There are no evident external inputs or dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network or system operations are present. The code appears to be a standard setup and import script for a blockchain interaction library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard library setup for Walytis blockchain API interaction. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified based on the provided code. It appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious module.",
