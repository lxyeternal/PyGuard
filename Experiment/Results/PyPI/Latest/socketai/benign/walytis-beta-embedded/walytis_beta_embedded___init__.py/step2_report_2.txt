  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Sets environment variables related to the Walytis API and internal configuration.\n- Imports numerous functions, classes, exceptions, and version constants from internal modules.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted external data within this snippet.\n- The environment variables are set statically within the code, which is typical for configuration modules.\n- The code appears to serve as a package setup or initialization script.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, environment variables are set internally, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard imports and environment variable setup.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent; no malicious signs.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, environment variables are static, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** No external input handling, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, static environment variables, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis:\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily static configuration and import statements.\n- No signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity.\n- Environment variables are set internally with fixed values, which is typical for configuration modules.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are visible.\n- The environment variable 'ipfs' is imported from an experimental config module, which could be a point of concern if it were to execute untrusted code, but nothing in the snippet suggests malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the static, non-malicious nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting minimal configuration risk, but not indicating any significant security concern.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a standard setup for a Python package, primarily involving static configuration and imports.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or vulnerabilities based on this snippet.\n- The setting of environment variables within the code is common for configuration modules and does not inherently pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the given scores and assessments. The code appears benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\nThis code is a standard, well-structured module setup for a blockchain API library, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
