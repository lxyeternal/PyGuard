{
  "purpose": "This module provides an API interface for interacting with the Walytis blockchain platform and includes utility functions, exception handling, and version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (e.g., WALYTIS_BETA_API_TYPE, AUTO_LOAD_BAP_MODULES), imports functions, classes, and constants from internal modules and submodules, and sets an environment variable 'ipfs'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are evident; environment variables are set internally and no external input handling is observed.",
  "flows": "The code initializes environment variables, then imports various components and exceptions that are presumably used elsewhere in the application; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations are visible here.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the setting of environment variables directly within the code, which could influence the application's behavior but does not by itself indicate malicious intent. The environment variable 'ipfs' is imported from a potentially experimental config module, which may be unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static configuration and imports. It sets environment variables related to API types and loading modules, then imports numerous functions, classes, and exceptions from internal modules. No data input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The setting of environment variables could influence runtime behavior but does not introduce security risks or malicious code. The presence of an experimental config import 'ipfs' suggests potential experimental features but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup for a blockchain API, mainly importing functions and setting environment variables. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware are evident. The use of environment variables within the code is typical for configuration purposes and does not suggest malicious activity.",
