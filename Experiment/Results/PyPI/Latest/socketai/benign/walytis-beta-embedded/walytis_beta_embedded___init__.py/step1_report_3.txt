{
  "purpose": "This package provides an API for interacting with the Walytis blockchain platform and related utilities.",
  "sources": "Environment variables set via os.environ; imports from internal modules and submodules.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling identified; environment variable setting could influence runtime behavior.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are set at the start; imported modules likely contain the main functionality. No explicit data flow or untrusted input processing observed in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Setting environment variables programmatically at import time can influence runtime behavior, but no malicious intent is evident. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. No suspicious code patterns, dynamic execution, or obfuscation features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules, sets environment variables, and documents purpose. The environment variables are configured to control API behavior, but they do not involve sensitive data or malicious logic. The import statements are standard and do not execute external or untrusted code. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are apparent. The code structure is typical for a package initialization or module setup, with no suspicious operations or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for a blockchain API library, with environment variables configured for runtime behavior. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident in this code snippet.",
