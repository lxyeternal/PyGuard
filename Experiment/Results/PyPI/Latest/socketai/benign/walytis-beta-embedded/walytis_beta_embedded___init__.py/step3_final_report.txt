{
  "purpose": "Sets environment variables for Walytis API configuration and imports internal modules, classes, functions, exceptions, and version info for blockchain interactions.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of environment variables within the code; imports from internal, trusted modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no network calls or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "flows": "Static configuration flow; no data flow from untrusted sources; imports and environment variables are fixed.",
  "anomalies": "Setting environment variables programmatically within the code, which is typical for configuration modules, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup for a Python package, involving environment variable configuration and internal imports. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted external data is present. The environment variables are assigned fixed values, and the imported modules are internal and presumably trusted. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident. The code serves as an initialization or configuration script for the Walytis blockchain API library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions as a standard static configuration and import module, suitable for its purpose.",
