  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Sets environment variables related to Walytis API configuration.\n- Imports numerous functions, classes, exceptions, and version info from internal modules.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted external data is visible.\n- The environment variables are statically assigned, and imports are from internal, presumably trusted modules.\n- The code appears to be a standard setup or initialization script for a blockchain API library.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is mainly static configuration and imports. It notes the setting of environment variables and the lack of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which seems appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, justified as low.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or anomalies; standard setup.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature and trusted imports. No suspicious code or network activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, justified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard package initialization.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusions—configuration via environment variables, trusted internal imports, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior reports; static setup, no external data handling or suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard library setup.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; no malicious activity, static configuration, internal trusted imports.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, typical setup.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are there any signs of malware or malicious intent?**  \n  No. All reports agree that the code is primarily static configuration and imports from internal modules. There are no network calls, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted data.\n\n- **Is the environment variable setting suspicious?**  \n  No. Setting environment variables internally for configuration is common practice.\n\n- **Any obfuscation or suspicious patterns?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, with clear imports and environment setup.\n\n- **Are the scores consistent?**  \n  Yes. Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the static and trusted nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 — low, reflecting standard configuration practices, not security risks.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard initialization and import module for a blockchain API library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (appropriate for static configuration code)  \n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the consensus across all reports.",
