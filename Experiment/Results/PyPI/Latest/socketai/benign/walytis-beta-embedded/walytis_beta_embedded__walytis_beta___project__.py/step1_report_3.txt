{
  "purpose": "This script appears to define project metadata and configuration details for a Python package named Walytis_Beta.",
  "sources": "os.path.basename, os.path.dirname, os.path.exists, open (reading ReadMe.md and requirements.txt), imported modules (version_utils, versions)",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is being written to external systems or used insecurely",
  "flows": "Data flows from filesystem checks and file reading into variables like long_description and install_requires, but these are only used internally for configuration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard metadata setup with file existence checks and variable assignments",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads project metadata, reads optional description and requirements files, and constructs URLs and other metadata attributes. It includes standard safety practices such as checking for file existence before reading. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors are present. Imported modules are typical for versioning and project info. No dynamic code execution, network connections (besides static URL strings), or credential handling are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard project setup code for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe file reads and constructs package metadata accordingly.",
