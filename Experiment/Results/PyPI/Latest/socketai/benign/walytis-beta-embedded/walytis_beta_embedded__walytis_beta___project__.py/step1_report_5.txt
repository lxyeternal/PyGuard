{
  "purpose": "This code sets up metadata for a Python project named Walytis_Beta, including versioning, description, URLs, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading project directory name, reading 'ReadMe.md' file, reading 'requirements.txt' file, and accessing version information from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data are evident; the code primarily reads files and sets variables.",
  "flows": "Reads input from filesystem ('ReadMe.md' and 'requirements.txt') to populate variables, with no further data processing or output to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior are present. The URL is a static IPNS link, which is consistent with intended project metadata. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads project metadata, reading optional files ('ReadMe.md' and 'requirements.txt') to populate variables for project configuration. It constructs URLs and sets package information. No user input, untrusted data, or network interactions are performed at runtime. The code appears to be standard setup/configuration code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard project metadata setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads static files and assigns metadata variables, with no suspicious or malicious activity observed.",
