{
  "purpose": "This script appears to set up project metadata for a Python package related to a blockchain project called Walytis_Beta.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the filesystem: the current script directory, a requirements.txt file, and potentially a ReadMe.md file. It also imports modules and constants from external libraries.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted input into critical operations are present. The only file operations are reading static files, and URL assignments are hardcoded.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script mainly reads files and sets variables. No untrusted data is processed into critical functions or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior are evident. URL strings are static, and the code appears to be a typical setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes project metadata, reads a README file if it exists, and loads requirements from a requirements.txt file if present. All operations involve static file paths or hardcoded strings. No external data is fetched or processed dynamically. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code's structure is straightforward and typical of setup or configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard project metadata configuration script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It reads static files and assigns variables for package setup. The overall security risk is minimal.",
