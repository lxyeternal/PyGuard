{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be a project metadata configuration for a Python package named Walytis_Beta, setting up package information such as version, author, description, dependencies, and URLs.",
  "sources": "Reading the current script file for requirements; checking for existence and reading content of 'ReadMe.md'; environment variables indirectly via os.path and os.path.exists.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to security issues are present. The code mainly reads static files and environment info for setup.",
  "flows": "The code reads file data (requirements.txt, ReadMe.md) and environment variables, assigns static values, and constructs URLs and data structures for package metadata. No untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code primarily reads local files and defines static package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and third-party modules, sets variables with static data, and reads files if they exist. There are no user inputs, external network interactions, or dynamic code execution. The URL points to an IPFS address but is static. No code injection, malicious payloads, or obfuscated code are present. The only minor point is reading 'ReadMe.md' and 'requirements.txt' without validation, but these are standard practices for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. It simply collects and structures package metadata.",
