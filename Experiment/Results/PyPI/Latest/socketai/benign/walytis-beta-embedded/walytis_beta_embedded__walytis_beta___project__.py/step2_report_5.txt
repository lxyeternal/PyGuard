  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward project metadata script for a Python package.\n- It reads static files ('ReadMe.md', 'requirements.txt') if they exist.\n- It imports version information and sets package metadata variables.\n- URLs are hardcoded, including an IPFS/IPNS address.\n- No user input, dynamic code execution, or network calls beyond static URL assignment.\n- No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The only potential concern is reading files ('ReadMe.md', 'requirements.txt') without validation, but this is standard practice in setup scripts.\n- The IPFS/IPNS URL is static; no dynamic or malicious URL manipulation is present.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- Minor typo: `\"Project metadat for Walytis_Beta.\"` should be `\"Project metadata for Walytis_Beta.\"` (not a security issue).\n- The filename `'ReadMe.md'` is checked with `os.path.exists()`, but the standard is `'README.md'`. This could cause the description not to be read if the filename differs, but it's not a security flaw.\n- No security flaws or logic errors are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is consistent.\n- The risk scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), appropriate for such straightforward code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is correct.\n- The only slight concern could be the static IPFS/IPNS URL, but it doesn't pose a security risk in this context.\n\n### Malware score:\n- All reports correctly identify malware score as 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n### Assumptions and claims:\n- No claims are based on unwarranted assumptions; all analyses are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security vulnerabilities or supply chain risks.\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign project metadata setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No further action needed; the code is safe.",
