{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a project metadata configuration script for the Walytis_Beta package, setting variables such as name, version, author, description, URLs, and requirements.",
  "sources": "Reads 'ReadMe.md' and 'requirements.txt' files if they exist; imports version info; uses static URL strings.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or used in a way that could lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "Reads static files into variables; assigns static URL strings; no dynamic or untrusted data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in the comment ('metadat' instead of 'metadata'); filename 'ReadMe.md' differs from common 'README.md', which may affect long_description content but not security.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for package metadata, involving static file reads and variable assignments. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or processing of untrusted input. The URL points to an IPFS/IPNS address, which is common for decentralized hosting but not inherently malicious. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or near-zero) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. The only minor concern is the static IPFS/IPNS URL, which does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign project setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are accurate and appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
