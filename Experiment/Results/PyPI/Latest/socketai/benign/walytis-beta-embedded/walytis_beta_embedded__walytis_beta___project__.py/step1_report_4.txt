{
  "purpose": "This script initializes project metadata, reads dependencies, and constructs project information for packaging.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'ReadMe.md' if it exists and reads lines from 'requirements.txt' if it exists.",
  "sinks": "None of the data sources directly feed into insecure sinks; no untrusted data is executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "File existence checks lead to reading files; the data read is stored in variables but not used insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The URL uses IPFS/IPNS which is common for decentralized storage, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules, sets variables, reads content from 'ReadMe.md' and 'requirements.txt', and constructs URLs and metadata. All operations are straightforward file reads and string assignments without execution of untrusted code or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present. The URL points to a decentralized storage location but does not indicate malicious intent. No sensitive information is hardcoded beyond author and project details. The overall structure appears normal for a project metadata script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard project metadata setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely reads some files and sets variables. No evidence of supply chain attacks or malware is found.",
