  "purpose": "To import and expose the 'laufband' module and retrieve the package version information.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() call to get the package version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no data is transmitted, stored, or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "The version information is retrieved and assigned to __version__, but not transmitted externally or used maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The use of importlib.metadata is standard for version retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'laufband' module and fetches its version using importlib.metadata. It then sets __all__ to expose 'laufband'. All operations are standard for a package's __init__.py file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data leaks, hidden network activity, or code injections. The code is minimal and appears to serve a typical package initialization purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to initialize the package's namespace and provide version info. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
