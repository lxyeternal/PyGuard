{
  "purpose": "This code imports metadata for the 'laufband' package and exposes the 'laufband' module for external use.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version('laufband')",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "The code uses importlib.metadata to retrieve package version, which is a standard operation. No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports 'importlib.metadata' to access package metadata and imports a specific module 'laufband' from the 'laufband' package. It then defines __all__ for export and retrieves the package version dynamically. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious data flows. The code performs minimal and legitimate operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, standard for package initialization, and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
