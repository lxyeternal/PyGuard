  "purpose": "The code imports a module and retrieves its version information, then exposes an object for external use.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() retrieves version info from the installed package; import statements load external modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; version retrieval is standard and safe.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import and exposes a symbol. Using importlib.metadata to get package version is standard practice. The module import appears to be normal. No malicious or suspicious behavior observed. No data leaks, code injections, or hidden functionalities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing basic import operations and version retrieval without any malicious intent or security risks.",
