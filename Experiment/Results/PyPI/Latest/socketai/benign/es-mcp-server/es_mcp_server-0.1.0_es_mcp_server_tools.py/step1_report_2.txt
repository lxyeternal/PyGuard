{
  "purpose": "Provide asynchronous utility functions for interacting with Elasticsearch, including listing indices, getting mappings, performing searches, and retrieving cluster health and stats.",
  "sources": "create_es_client() for establishing ES connections, user-provided index and query parameters, process_response() for handling responses.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly detected; responses are processed normally, and no untrusted data is directly written to system or network resources.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (index, query_body) flow into Elasticsearch API calls via create_es_client(), with responses processed by process_response().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. Use of standard async calls and response handling appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an ES client asynchronously, performs various operations (list, get mapping, search, cluster health/stats), handles exceptions with logging, and closes clients properly. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns detected. Functions rely on external modules (create_es_client, process_response) assumed to be standard. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Elasticsearch utility module for managing indices and cluster info. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code, and no suspicious behavior was detected.",
