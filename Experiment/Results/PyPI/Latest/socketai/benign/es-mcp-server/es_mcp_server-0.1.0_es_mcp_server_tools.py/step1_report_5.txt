{
  "purpose": "The code provides asynchronous utility functions for interacting with an Elasticsearch server, including listing indices, retrieving mappings, performing searches, and getting cluster health and statistics.",
  "sources": "create_es_client() and process_response() functions imported from es_mcp_server.client, as well as input parameters like 'index' and 'query_body' supplied to functions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to disk, executes system commands, or performs network communication beyond calling the imported client functions. No untrusted data is directly executed or injected into system commands.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., 'index', 'query_body') are used in API calls to Elasticsearch through the client. Responses are processed via 'process_response'. No evident data flow leads to external systems or unintended data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with standard async Elasticsearch client calls. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. The 'highlight' parameter is added if missing, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The functions are primarily wrappers around Elasticsearch client calls, with exception handling and logging. They do not contain obfuscated code or suspicious logic. The only notable aspect is the addition of a 'highlight' section to query bodies if missing, which is standard practice. All data inputs are passed to the client without apparent modification or malicious use. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Elasticsearch utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It safely performs typical Elasticsearch operations without hardcoded secrets or malicious code. The overall security risk is very low.",
