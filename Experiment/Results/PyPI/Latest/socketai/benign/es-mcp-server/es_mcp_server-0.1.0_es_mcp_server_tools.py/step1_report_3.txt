{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for interacting with Elasticsearch, including listing indices, getting mappings, performing searches, and retrieving cluster health and stats.",
  "sources": "create_es_client() for establishing a connection, process_response() for processing responses, and input parameters such as index and query_body.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly found. The code does not write untrusted data to external systems or execute commands based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (index, query_body) flow into Elasticsearch client calls; responses are processed and returned. No external or untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual control flow detected. The code uses standard async calls and error handling. No obfuscated or misleading code found.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around Elasticsearch client operations with proper asynchronous handling and error logging. It does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code appears to perform standard Elasticsearch queries, including listing indices, getting mappings, searching, and fetching cluster info. No indications of data leakage, malicious injections, or malicious code execution were found. The functions do not execute any system commands, write to external endpoints, or handle untrusted input insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Elasticsearch utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appropriately manages connections and errors without suspicious patterns. The overall security risk is low.",
