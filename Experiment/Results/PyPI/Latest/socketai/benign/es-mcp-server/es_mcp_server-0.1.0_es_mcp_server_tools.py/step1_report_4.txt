{
  "purpose": "Provide asynchronous Elasticsearch management functions including listing indices, retrieving mappings, performing searches, and obtaining cluster health and stats.",
  "sources": "External inputs are 'index' and 'query_body' parameters in functions, which are used directly in Elasticsearch client methods.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from Elasticsearch responses are processed but not directly fed into untrusted sinks; however, inputs like 'index' and 'query_body' could influence the queries and responses.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (index, query_body) flow into Elasticsearch client methods which execute queries; responses are processed and returned. No indication of untrusted data manipulation beyond standard query execution.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard for an Elasticsearch client; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The only notable aspect is the automatic addition of highlight fields if not present, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines asynchronous functions that interact with Elasticsearch via a client, with proper error handling and resource cleanup (closing client connections). It accepts input parameters for index and query bodies, executes requests, and processes responses. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or data exfiltration. Inputs are used directly in Elasticsearch queries but are typical for such client code; no dangerous data handling observed. The code relies on external modules 'es_mcp_server.client' for client creation and response processing, which could contain risks, but from this code alone, nothing suspicious is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Elasticsearch client utility with no apparent malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It handles data securely, with proper resource management. No signs of malware or security risks are present based solely on this code segment.",
