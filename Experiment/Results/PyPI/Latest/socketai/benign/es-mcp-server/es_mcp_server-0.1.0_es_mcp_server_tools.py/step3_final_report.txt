{
  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous utility functions for Elasticsearch operations such as listing indices, getting mappings, searching, and retrieving cluster health and stats.",
  "sources": "External functions create_es_client() and process_response(), as well as input parameters like index and query_body.",
  "sinks": "API calls to Elasticsearch that could process untrusted input, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (index, query_body) are passed directly to Elasticsearch client methods; responses are processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic addition of 'highlight' field in search queries if absent; no other unusual code patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured async wrapper around Elasticsearch API calls. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Error handling and resource cleanup are properly implemented. The external dependencies are assumed safe. No suspicious data flows or malicious behaviors are detected. The only minor behavior is the default addition of a highlight section in search queries, which is benign. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility module for Elasticsearch interactions with no malicious indicators. External dependencies should be reviewed separately, but based on this code alone, it poses minimal security risk.",
