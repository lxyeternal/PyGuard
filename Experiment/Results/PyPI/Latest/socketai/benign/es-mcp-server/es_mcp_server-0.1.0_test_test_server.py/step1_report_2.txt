{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for Elasticsearch server interactions, mocking responses to test functions that list indices, get mappings, perform searches, and retrieve cluster health and stats.",
  "sources": "Function calls to create_es_client(), process_response(), and mocked response objects; mock_es_client used to simulate Elasticsearch client methods.",
  "sinks": "None observed. The code does not perform any network I/O, file access, or execute untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "create_es_client() is patched to return a mock client; each test invokes functions that call the mock client's methods; responses are processed via process_response(), which is also patched.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. No code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. All interactions are mock-based, typical for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of test functions that mock Elasticsearch client behavior to verify functional correctness. The use of mocks and patches is standard for testing. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The functions perform typical testing tasks without harmful side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for Elasticsearch-related functions, using mocks to simulate responses. There is no malicious intent or malicious code detected. It appears safe and purely for testing purposes.",
