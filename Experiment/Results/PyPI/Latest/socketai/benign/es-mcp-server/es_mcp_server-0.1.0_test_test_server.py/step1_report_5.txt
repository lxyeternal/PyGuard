{
  "purpose": "Unit testing Elasticsearch client interactions and response processing functions within the es_mcp_server module.",
  "sources": "Mocked data used within test fixtures and test cases, including mock responses for Elasticsearch client methods.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to create_es_client and process_response, which are patched to avoid actual network or processing actions; no direct untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Test cases invoke functions like list_indices, get_mappings, etc., which internally call create_es_client to obtain a mock client, then process_response with mocked responses, ensuring no real data or network interaction occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. Use of mocks and patches aligns with standard testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests utilizing mocks and patches to simulate Elasticsearch interactions. All external interactions are mocked, and there are no indications of malicious payloads, hidden backdoors, or security-compromising behaviors. The code performs expected testing functions, with no suspicious data handling or side effects. No malicious activity or malware signatures are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for Elasticsearch client functions with proper mocking. No malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks are identified. The structure is typical for testing purposes, with no anomalies or security concerns.",
