  "purpose": "Unit testing for Elasticsearch MCP server tools functions such as listing indices, getting mappings, searching, and retrieving cluster health and stats.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (asyncio, pytest, unittest.mock), and within the test functions, data is generated via mock objects and return values are configured for the mocked Elasticsearch client methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly handle untrusted input data; it primarily mocks responses and verifies function calls. No data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks like network or system commands.",
  "flows": "Mocks are set up to simulate Elasticsearch client responses. The test functions call the functions under test, which in turn invoke mocked client methods. The flow is straightforward: test calls -> mocked responses -> assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The code appears standard for unit testing with mocking.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit tests on Elasticsearch tool functions using mocking to simulate responses from Elasticsearch client methods. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are processed. No suspicious behavior or malicious code patterns are present. The use of mock objects and test fixtures is standard practice. The code is well-structured for testing without executing real network operations or exposing sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign test suite for Elasticsearch client functions. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It relies on mocking to verify function behaviors. No signs of sabotage, data leakage, or malicious activity are detected.",
