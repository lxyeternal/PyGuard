  "purpose": "Declaration of the version of an Elasticsearch MCP server package.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external system interaction is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows identified as there is no processing logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, consisting only of a version string and a comment; no suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is a simple comment and a version variable assignment. It contains no executable logic, no input/output operations, and no use of third-party libraries. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues. The presence of a comment in Chinese indicates the code might be part of a larger project related to Elasticsearch MCP servers, but this snippet alone does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, benign code fragment with no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves merely as a version declaration for a package.",
