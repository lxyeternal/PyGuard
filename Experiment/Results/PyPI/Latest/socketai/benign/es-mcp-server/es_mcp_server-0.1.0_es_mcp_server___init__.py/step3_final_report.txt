  "purpose": "Declaration of package version for an Elasticsearch MCP server package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it only contains a comment and a version variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present, as there are no functions or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple comment and a version string assignment with no executable logic, input/output, or external system interactions. It lacks any malicious or suspicious features, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of this snippet. The confidence score of 1 is justified given the clarity and simplicity of the code. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal declaration of version information with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
