  "sources": "None; no input or data reading observed",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since the code is minimal and static",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; no suspicious or unusual code present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment and a version string assignment. There are no input operations, no data processing, no external communications, and no complex logic. Given the simplicity, it does not exhibit any malicious behavior or obfuscation. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The code appears to serve a basic purpose of setting a version identifier for a package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, minimal, and serves a straightforward purpose of defining a version. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
