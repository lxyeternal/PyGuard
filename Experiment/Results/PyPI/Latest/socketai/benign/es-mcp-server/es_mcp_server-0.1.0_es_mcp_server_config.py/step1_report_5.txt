{
  "purpose": "Load and manage Elasticsearch connection configuration using environment variables and provide structured access to connection parameters.",
  "sources": "Environment variables loaded via os.getenv and dotenv; attributes in the ESConfig class that read environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if environment variables contain sensitive information such as passwords or API keys are exposed; no direct sinks that perform harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read during class instantiation; attributes such as host, port, username, password, api_key, use_ssl, verify_certs are initialized from these variables; properties like has_auth and hosts generate derived data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials beyond defaults; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors observed. Usage of dotenv is standard for config loading.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads configuration data from environment variables with default values; uses standard libraries for environment management; the presence of sensitive fields such as password and api_key are handled properly. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. It is a straightforward configuration loader.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a configuration loader for Elasticsearch connection parameters. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It adheres to standard practices for environment-based configuration management.",
