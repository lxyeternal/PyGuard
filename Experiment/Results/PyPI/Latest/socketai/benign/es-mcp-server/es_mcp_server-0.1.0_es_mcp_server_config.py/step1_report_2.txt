  "purpose": "Load and manage Elasticsearch connection configuration using environment variables with support for default values.",
  "sources": "Environment variables loaded via os.getenv and dotenv; configuration class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is being written or transmitted outside the application.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → class attributes → property methods; no external data flow or untrusted output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. Uses standard libraries and environment variables for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables related to Elasticsearch configuration, providing defaults and optional parameters. It utilizes dotenv to load environment variables from a file, and pydantic's BaseSettings for configuration management. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code. It contains standard practices for configuration loading and validation. No signs of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious code execution are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration module for Elasticsearch settings, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to best practices for handling environment-based configuration and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code.",
