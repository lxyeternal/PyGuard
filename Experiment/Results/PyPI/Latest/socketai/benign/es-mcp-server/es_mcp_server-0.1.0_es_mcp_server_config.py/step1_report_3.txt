  "purpose": "Load and manage Elasticsearch connection configurations from environment variables, supporting secure credentials and connection options.",
  "sources": "Environment variables loaded via os.getenv for ES_HOST, ES_PORT, ES_USERNAME, ES_PASSWORD, ES_API_KEY, ES_USE_SSL, ES_VERIFY_CERTS, ES_VERSION.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but sensitive data (credentials, API keys) are stored in environment variables; no direct leak mechanism shown.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at class initialization; properties access these variables to determine configuration states.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets beyond environment variables; code appears straightforward. No suspicious dynamic code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration data securely from environment variables using standard methods. It includes optional credentials and API keys, with logic to determine if authentication is configured. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed. The code does not perform any network operations or data leaks; it simply manages configuration data. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of dotenv and pydantic_settings is typical for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader for Elasticsearch, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It handles sensitive data properly via environment variables and does not contain suspicious logic or malicious behavior.",
