{
  "purpose": "A testing client for MCP server operations related to Elasticsearch, performing tasks like listing indices, getting mappings, searching, and checking cluster health and stats.",
  "sources": "Network responses from MCP server, command-line arguments for configuration",
  "sinks": "Logging server responses, JSON parsing of responses",
  "flows": "Network responses are received and logged; data flows from server to logs and function return values",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; standard network communication and logging",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward asynchronous testing utility that connects to an MCP server via SSE, performs standard Elasticsearch-related API calls, logs responses, and handles exceptions. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. Logging server responses could raise privacy concerns but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk ~0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign testing client for MCP with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score is justified mainly due to response logging, which is typical in testing tools. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
