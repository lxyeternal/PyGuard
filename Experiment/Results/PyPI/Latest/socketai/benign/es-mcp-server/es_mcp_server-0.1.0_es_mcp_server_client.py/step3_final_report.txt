  "purpose": "Factory module for creating Elasticsearch clients supporting ES7 and ES8, with response processing tailored to each version.",
  "sources": "Configuration variables from es_config (host, port, ssl, credentials, api_key, es_version), dynamic imports based on version, response object in process_response.",
  "sinks": "Response handling in process_response, potential use of credentials in connection parameters.",
  "flows": "Configuration variables → _get_connection_params() → create_es_client() → response processing in process_response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Standard practices used throughout.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, configuration-driven factory for creating Elasticsearch clients supporting ES7 and ES8. It uses dynamic imports, constructs connection parameters based on configuration, and processes responses according to version. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to configuration management, which is typical. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting standard operational considerations. The confidence level is high, given the clarity and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Elasticsearch client factory with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
