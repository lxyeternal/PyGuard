  "purpose": "Provides factory functions for creating Elasticsearch clients supporting versions 7 and 8, and processes responses accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters from es_config, including es_version, host, port, use_ssl, verify_certs, username, password, api_key.",
  "sinks": "Uses the configuration to establish a network connection; processes response objects.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters influence connection setup; create_es_client uses these parameters to instantiate clients; process_response returns data based on ES version.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; conditional logic based on version is standard; no obfuscated or suspicious code features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an Elasticsearch client factory with response handling. It retrieves configuration settings for connection parameters, constructs URLs, and creates asynchronous clients for ES7 and ES8. Response processing depends on the ES version, either returning the response directly or its body. No code injection, malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activities are evident. All data handling and library usage are standard. Configuration-dependent behavior is typical for such connectors.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a normal, legitimate client factory for Elasticsearch, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It relies on external configuration and standard libraries. No security risks or malware signals are detected.",
