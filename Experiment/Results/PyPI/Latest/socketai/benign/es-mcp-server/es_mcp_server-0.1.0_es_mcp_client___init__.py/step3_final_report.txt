  "purpose": "Package metadata placeholder indicating the version of the Elasticsearch MCP client",
  "sources": "No data inputs; only a comment and a version string assignment",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment of version string",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, functions, or data processing; minimal content",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment and a version string assignment, indicating a package metadata file. No functions, data inputs/outputs, network activity, or embedded secrets are present. The code is benign, serving as a placeholder or descriptor. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The minimal nature of the code aligns with standard package metadata practices, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal package descriptor with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security assessment scores are justified, and no further action or concern is warranted.",
