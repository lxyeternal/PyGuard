{
  "purpose": "This code implements an Elasticsearch MCP server providing tools for index management, mappings, search, and cluster info, supporting multiple transport modes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (ES_HOST, ES_PORT, ES_VERSION), command-line arguments, and internal function calls for Elasticsearch interactions.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, error messages, and responses returned by tool functions; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables or user parameters flows into configuration, then through async tool functions interacting with Elasticsearch, with results returned to clients.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. No external network connections outside expected Elasticsearch interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured server setup for Elasticsearch management, using async functions, environment variables, and proper error handling. No malicious or suspicious logic, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The environment-based configuration is typical, and logs do not leak sensitive info. The code aligns with legitimate management tools, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Elasticsearch MCP server implementation with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It employs standard practices, and the security assessment indicates minimal risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting very low risk. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
