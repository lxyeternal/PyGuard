  "purpose": "To evaluate supply chain security risks and malicious behavior in the provided Python dependency code snippets.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly provided; the analysis is based solely on the code content, if any.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file system modifications, or data leaks, but none are evident in the provided code snippets.",
  "flows": "Data flow analysis is limited due to minimal or absent code; no source-to-sink paths are identifiable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; minimal or placeholder code is present.",
  "analysis": "All reports either lack code or contain minimal, non-malicious code. Reports 1, 2, 3, and 5 correctly identify the absence of malicious activity and assign zero scores. Report 4 describes minimal data processing code with low confidence and risk scores, which are appropriate given the limited information. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious behavior is found. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with a slight possibility of minimal suspicion in Report 4, but overall, the assessment remains conservative and justified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided data, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks in the analyzed code snippets. The scores are appropriate and conservative, reflecting the limited or absent code content. No adjustments are necessary.",
