{
  "purpose": "This code manages dependencies and compatibility checks for the Requests HTTP library, including version validation, environment setup, and warnings configuration.",
  "sources": "Version strings from imported modules (urllib3, chardet, charset_normalizer, cryptography), internal functions, and exception handling.",
  "sinks": "Warnings and assertions that may raise exceptions or warnings based on version mismatches or environment issues.",
  "flows": "Version and environment data are read from imported modules, passed to validation functions, which then may trigger warnings or assertions, but no data is ever sent externally or used maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for version checks; these could cause application termination if conditions are not met, but do not pose direct malicious risks. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs dependency version validation, environment checks, and warning configurations for the Requests library. It imports external modules, retrieves version info, and asserts compatibility conditions, raising warnings when necessary. The use of assertions is a potential source of runtime exceptions if versions are incompatible, but these are standard for compatibility enforcement. No external data is transmitted, nor are any system modifications or malicious behaviors evident. The code ensures the environment is suitable for the library but does not contain any backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is focused on dependency management and environment setup without any malicious intent. It performs necessary checks and warnings to ensure library stability. No malicious or suspicious activity was detected. The overall security risk is very low.",
