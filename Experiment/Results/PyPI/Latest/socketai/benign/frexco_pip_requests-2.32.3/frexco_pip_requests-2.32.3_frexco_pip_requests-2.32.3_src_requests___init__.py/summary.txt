  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for the Requests library, focusing on dependency validation and environment configuration. It contains no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk around 0.1–0.2 mainly due to reliance on assertions and fallback logic, which are standard practices."
