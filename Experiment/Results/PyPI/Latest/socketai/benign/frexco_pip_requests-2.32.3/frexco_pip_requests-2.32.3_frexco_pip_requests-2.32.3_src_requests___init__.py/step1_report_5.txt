  "purpose": "The code initializes and checks dependencies for the Requests HTTP library, manages compatibility, and sets up environment configurations.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (urllib3, charset_normalizer, chardet, ssl, cryptography), internal modules (exceptions, api, models, sessions, status_codes), and version information.",
  "sinks": "Potentially insecure warnings or exception handling, but primarily for dependency management and environment setup; no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Dependency checks and environment configuration flow from import statements to warnings and conditional imports, with no user data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code segments detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code focuses on dependency management and environment setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency version checks, compatibility assertions, environment setup for SSL/SNI support, and warning configurations. No data processing, user input handling, or network activity occurs. All operations are standard for library setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard dependency and environment setup script for the Requests library. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It primarily manages dependencies and environment compatibility, with appropriate warnings and imports.",
