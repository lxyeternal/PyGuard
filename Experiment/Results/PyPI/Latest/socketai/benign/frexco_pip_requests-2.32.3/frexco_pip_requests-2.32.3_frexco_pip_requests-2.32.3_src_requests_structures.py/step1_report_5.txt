  "purpose": "Define data structures for handling HTTP headers and related data with case-insensitive behavior and flexible lookup.",
  "sources": "Input data in constructors (__init__) and update methods; key lookups in __getitem__ and get methods.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data being sent to external systems or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into internal storage via update or constructor, then is accessed via key lookups.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The code uses standard data structures and conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, well-understood data structures: a case-insensitive dictionary and a simple lookup dictionary. It correctly manages case-insensitive key handling without executing or executing dynamic code, nor does it perform network or system operations. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for handling HTTP headers and related data with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended for normal application use, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
