  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define custom exception classes for handling HTTP and connection errors.\n- Source: Standard imports and class definitions.\n- Sinks/Flows: No data processing or untrusted data execution.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Straightforward exception class definitions; no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Benign, standard exception definitions.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining exception classes.\n- Source: Standard imports and class structures.\n- Sinks/Flows: Exception instantiation and pickling (__reduce__).\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns; standard inheritance.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior; the __reduce__ method is standard for pickling support.\n- Conclusion: Safe, normal code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Defines exception classes with some focus on serialization (__reduce__).\n- Source: Exception handling, attribute checks.\n- Sinks/Flows: Exception creation and pickling.\n- Anomalies: No malicious intent; standard patterns.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious code; the pickling method is standard.\n- Conclusion: Normal, benign code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Similar exception class definitions.\n- Source: Imports and class definitions.\n- Sinks/Flows: No data processing.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard library pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Source: Standard class definitions.\n- Sinks/Flows: No data flow from untrusted sources.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No malicious code detected.\n- Conclusion: Benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware=0 is justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward and not obfuscated; obfuscated=0 is justified.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions for the Requests library.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The use of __reduce__ is standard for pickling support, not malicious.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.",
