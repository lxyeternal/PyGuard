{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of exception classes for handling HTTP and connection errors in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and a compat module; class definitions that do not process external input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing; exception instantiation and pickling (__reduce__) are standard and safe.",
  "flows": "Exception creation and serialization via __reduce__, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard inheritance and constructors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward exception hierarchy for request errors, with standard constructors and a correct __reduce__ method for pickling. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of __reduce__ is typical for exception serialization and does not pose security risks in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.",
