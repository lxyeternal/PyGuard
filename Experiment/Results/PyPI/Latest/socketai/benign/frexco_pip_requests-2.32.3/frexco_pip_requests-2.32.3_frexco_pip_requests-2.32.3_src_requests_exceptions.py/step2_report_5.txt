  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the code against the described concerns.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code defines a set of exception classes for the Requests library, inheriting from standard Python exceptions and external exceptions from urllib3 and compat modules.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation is present.\n- The code structure is typical for a library's error handling module.\n- The __reduce__ method in JSONDecodeError is standard for pickling support.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- Exception classes are straightforward, with constructors handling optional request/response objects.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign a security risk score of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious or risky behavior.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:** No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; the code is purely class definitions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, benign set of exception class definitions typical for a HTTP request library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
