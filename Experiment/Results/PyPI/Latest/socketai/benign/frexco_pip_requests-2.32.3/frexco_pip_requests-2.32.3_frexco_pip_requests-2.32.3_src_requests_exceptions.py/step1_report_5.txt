{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for handling various request-related errors in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code defines exception classes and imports external exceptions; it does not read input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data could lead to leaks or effects; exception handling is standard.",
  "flows": "The code establishes class inheritance for error handling but does not include data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code consists solely of class definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of exception classes for the Requests library, with proper inheritance and minimal logic. It imports external exceptions and defines custom exceptions for various HTTP and connection errors. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are detected. The structure aligns with typical library design, with no signs of sabotage or malware. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or privilege escalation. All exception classes are standard and do not contain any embedded code that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard exception class module for the Requests library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage.",
