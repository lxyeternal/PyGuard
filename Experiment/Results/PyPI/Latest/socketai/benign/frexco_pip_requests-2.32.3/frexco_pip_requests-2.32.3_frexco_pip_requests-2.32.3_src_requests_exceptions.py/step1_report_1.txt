{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Requests library to handle various HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and local compat module; class constructors and attribute access within exception classes.",
  "sinks": "None of the exception classes contain code that directly executes untrusted input or data; no apparent data sinks.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated and potentially raised during HTTP request handling; no specific flow involving untrusted data manipulation observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code follows standard exception class patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for a HTTP request library, with inheritance, constructor initialization, and some special methods (__reduce__). No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. No input validation or data handling logic that could lead to vulnerabilities. The module appears to be standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a normal set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
