{
  "purpose": "This module implements HTTP request and response handling, including request preparation, encoding, cookies, hooks, and response processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from request parameters (data, files, json, params, cookies, hooks) and response content (self._content, self.raw).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include request body (body), headers, cookies, hooks, and response content. Notably, no direct data leaks or malicious data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into request preparation methods (prepare_body, prepare_url, etc.) and from server responses into response content properties (content, text, json). No suspicious flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. All functions appear consistent with standard HTTP request/response handling. No dynamic code execution or code injection mechanisms identified.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements standard HTTP request and response handling, including URL encoding, header validation, cookie management, and JSON parsing. The modules imported are standard or intended for common tasks, with no signs of malicious import or usage. The handling of request data, files, and hooks is typical and does not involve suspicious behaviors. Response handling includes standard decoding, error raising, and iteration mechanisms. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious actions are detected. The code’s structure and content align with typical, secure HTTP communication logic.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard implementation of HTTP request and response handling with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected functions securely and transparently, with no suspicious anomalies. The overall security risk is negligible.",
