{
  "purpose": "Standard HTTP request and response handling, including URL parsing, header validation, cookie management, JSON encoding/decoding, and streaming responses.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (method, url, headers, data, json, params, auth, cookies, hooks, files) and server response content.",
  "sinks": "Request transmission, response decoding, response content consumption.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into request preparation; server responses flow into response properties; data is encoded, decoded, and streamed as needed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard HTTP request/response classes with typical data handling, URL parsing, header validation, cookie management, and streaming. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Imports are from well-known libraries. Data flows are typical for an HTTP client library. No dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of an HTTP client component, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are justified. The low risk score (~0.1) reflects the benign nature of the code.",
