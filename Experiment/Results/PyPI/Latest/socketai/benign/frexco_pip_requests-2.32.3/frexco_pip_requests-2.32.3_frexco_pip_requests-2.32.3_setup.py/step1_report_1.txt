  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'requests' Python package, managing dependencies, version checks, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info, reads version info from '__version__.py', reads 'README.md' file, and command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Calls os.system() for publishing commands, executes code via exec(), and reads files.",
  "flows": "Version check -> potential 'publish' command execution -> reading version info and README -> setup() function with metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute version info from a file, and os.system() calls for publishing; exec() can execute arbitrary code if version file is compromised. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity found.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks: version validation, reading package metadata, and invoking setup(). The only potentially risky parts are the exec() call, which executes code from '__version__.py', and the use of os.system() for publishing, which could be exploited if input is maliciously manipulated. However, these are common in setup scripts. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup.py file with no clear signs of malicious intent. The use of exec() warrants caution but is standard practice if version files are controlled. The os.system() calls for publishing are also typical and pose minimal risk in this context. Overall, the code appears safe.",
