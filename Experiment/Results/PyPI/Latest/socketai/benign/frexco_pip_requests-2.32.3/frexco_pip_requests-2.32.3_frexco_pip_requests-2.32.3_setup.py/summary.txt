  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The primary concern is the use of exec() on external files, which should be controlled. The code is standard, and the security risk is low. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minor inherent risks due to exec()."
