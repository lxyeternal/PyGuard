  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for the 'requests' Python package, handling version checks, dependencies, and publishing commands.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__version__.py' via exec(), reads README.md for long description, and processes command-line arguments for publishing.",
  "sinks": "Uses exec() to execute code from version file, os.system() to run publish commands.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> executes it via exec() -> command-line argument triggers os.system() for publishing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info; open() call for version file has incorrect parameter ('r', 'utf-8') instead of encoding='utf-8'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with standard practices. The exec() call, while potentially risky if the version file is compromised, is common in such scripts assuming controlled files. The os.system() calls are static and only invoked during publishing, posing minimal risk. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The incorrect open() parameter is a bug but not security-related. The overall structure and logic are straightforward and align with standard package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The primary concern is the use of exec() on external files, which should be controlled. The code is standard, and the security risk is low. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minor inherent risks due to exec().",
