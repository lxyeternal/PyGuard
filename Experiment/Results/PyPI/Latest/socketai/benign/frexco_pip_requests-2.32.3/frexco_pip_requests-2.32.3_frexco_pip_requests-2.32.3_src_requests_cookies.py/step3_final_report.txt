  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for managing HTTP cookies within the requests library, including extraction, creation, merging, and cookie header handling.",
  "sources": "Request objects (request URL, headers), response objects (headers), cookie dictionaries, Morsel objects.",
  "sinks": "Cookie headers sent with requests, cookie jar modifications (adding, removing, merging cookies), cookie extraction from responses.",
  "flows": "Request data (URL, headers) -> CookieJar extraction and update -> Cookie header generation for requests; Response headers -> CookieJar extraction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Uses standard libraries and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie management utilities, including wrapping request/response headers, thread-safe cookie jar handling, and serialization support. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The functions perform expected tasks in cookie handling, with no network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of cookie utilities for the requests library. No malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation is evident. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
