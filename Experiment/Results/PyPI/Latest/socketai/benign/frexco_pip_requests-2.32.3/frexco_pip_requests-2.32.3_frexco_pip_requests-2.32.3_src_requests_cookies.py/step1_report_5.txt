  "purpose": "Compatibility utilities and functions for handling cookies within the requests library, including creating, extracting, managing, and merging cookies.",
  "sources": "Request object headers and URL; response headers; cookie parameters in functions like create_cookie and morsel_to_cookie; cookie jar iteration and manipulation.",
  "sinks": "Cookie header generation and insertion; cookie storage and deletion; cookie extraction from response headers.",
  "flows": "Input request headers and URLs -> MockRequest and MockResponse wrappers process data -> extract_cookies_to_jar and get_cookie_header manage cookie extraction and header formation -> set, get, and delete cookies in CookieJar -> create_cookie, morsel_to_cookie generate cookies from parameters or morsels.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is primarily standard cookie management logic with proper handling of cookie parameters and no evident malicious obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a suite of cookie management utilities tailored for the requests library, including cookie extraction, creation, removal, and merging. It employs standard Python modules like calendar, time, copy, and threading, with compatibility wrappers for different threading implementations. The classes MockRequest and MockResponse mimic interface expectations for cookiejar processing. The RequestsCookieJar extends CookieJar with dict-like interfaces, implementing methods for cookie access, iteration, and manipulation. No code shows signs of obfuscation, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors such as network-based data leaks or system damage. All functions perform expected cookie handling tasks, with appropriate checks and exception handling. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and aligned with standard cookie management practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate and standard implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It focuses solely on cookie handling and compatibility, without any suspicious or malicious code features.",
