  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'frexco-pip-requests' Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external calls.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted inputs; static assignments are made to metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is purely metadata declarations with no executable or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string assignments defining package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, and license. No external data inputs, user inputs, or network operations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The inclusion of emojis in __cake__ is harmless and purely decorative. The code does not perform any logic or operations beyond static variable assignments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, solely setting package metadata without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
