  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only initializes variables with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward metadata assignment with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments setting package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and an emoji. No user input, environment variable access, network calls, or executable code is present. The variables are static and do not interact with external sources or perform any operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely as package metadata with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate header for a Python package, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
