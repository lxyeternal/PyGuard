  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata.\n   - No external data inputs, network calls, or executable logic are present.\n   - The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of sinks, data flows, anomalies, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely static metadata with no external interactions, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on observable static code analysis.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is straightforward package metadata declarations with no dynamic or external behavior. It poses no security threat and contains no malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
