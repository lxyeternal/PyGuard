  "purpose": "Provides compatibility handling for Python 2 and 3, manages optional dependencies like chardet and simplejson, and detects urllib3 version.",
  "sources": "Version string of urllib3, import attempts for chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, and system info variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, network calls, or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Import and version detection logic without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Minor fallback for malformed urllib3 version string, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility module handling import compatibility, version detection, and optional dependencies. It performs safe import attempts, version parsing, and sets global variables accordingly. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The logic is standard and benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. All signals and scores are appropriate, with malware and risk scores at 0. The code structure and logic are straightforward and safe.",
