  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports describe the code as a compatibility layer that manages imports, version detection, and optional dependencies. The code does not execute untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any dynamic code execution. The logic is straightforward, primarily involving import attempts and version checks.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues or malicious behavior are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is a standard compatibility utility with no signs of malicious activity. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis that the code does not pose security risks.\n\n4. **Risk Score Higher than 0.5**  \nSince the code is benign, the overall risk score should be 0. The reports are consistent in this regard.\n\n5. **Potentially Malicious Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo claims in the reports rely on assumptions; they are based on code inspection and logical reasoning.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report Content**  \nScores are consistent with the detailed analyses provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Systematic Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\nThe code is a standard compatibility and dependency management module, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the nature of the code.",
