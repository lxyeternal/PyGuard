{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility utilities and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as managing dependencies like urllib3, chardet, and json.",
  "sources": "Reading module versions, attempting to import 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', importing JSON libraries, and retrieving system Python version info.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows directly into potentially dangerous functions or external systems.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows indicating malicious activity; data flow is limited to standard library imports and version checks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; code primarily handles compatibility and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs version detection, conditional imports, and compatibility setups without executing any untrusted code or external network calls. It carefully manages optional dependencies and Python version differences. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior are present. The code structure is straightforward and typical for compatibility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2/3 and dependency management with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious patterns.",
