{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as managing dependencies such as urllib3, chardet, and json.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information from urllib3, imports optional libraries (chardet, simplejson), and system information (sys.version_info). It also loads standard library modules and handles conditional imports based on environment.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or system effects. The code mainly performs safe imports and version checks.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules based on availability and version, with no direct processing or manipulation of untrusted input data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated sections. The code is straightforward, primarily for compatibility and import handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various standard and optional libraries with fallbacks. It performs version detection and conditionally imports modules like simplejson and chardet. No user input handling or dangerous operations are present. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are evident. The logic is for compatibility and dependency resolution only.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign compatibility and dependency management module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply manages imports and version detection for compatibility purposes.",
