{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and for importing various third-party libraries needed for HTTP requests and character detection.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (importlib, sys, collections, http, io, urllib), third-party libraries (urllib3, simplejson, chardet, charset_normalizer). The code also dynamically imports chardet or charset_normalizer based on availability.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input. No network communication, data storage, or external output functions present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, detecting versions and available libraries, and setting compatibility variables. There are no data flow paths from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are present. The code strictly performs import handling and compatibility setup without any malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages compatibility for different Python versions and optional third-party libraries. It performs version checks, conditional imports, and library detection in a straightforward manner. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code appears well-structured for its purpose, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a compatibility utility with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It only performs safe imports and environment checks for supporting different Python environments and libraries.",
