{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility support for different Python versions and HTTP libraries, as well as utility functions for character detection and URL handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information from urllib3, attempts to import 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', and loads JSON modules and system version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data; the code primarily imports modules and sets up compatibility variables.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines compatibility functions and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic detected. The code is straightforward and intended for compatibility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles module imports, version detection, and compatibility functions. It safely tries to import optional modules like 'simplejson' and 'chardet', and sets up version flags. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's structure is typical for compatibility modules. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility and utility setup for Python projects, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
