{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility utilities for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, imports necessary modules, and detects available libraries for character detection and JSON processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as importlib, sys, urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, collections, http.cookies, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code mainly imports modules and defines variables. No untrusted data handling or output is observed.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, detecting library versions, and defining compatibility variables; there are no source-to-sink data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard compatibility and import management. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical compatibility imports and version detection to ensure cross-version support. It dynamically imports optional modules like simplejson and character detection libraries, handling ImportError gracefully. The variables defined are for compatibility and do not process or leak data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to standard practices for compatibility modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility utility module with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly manages imports, version detection, and library detection for compatibility purposes, with no suspicious or harmful behavior.",
