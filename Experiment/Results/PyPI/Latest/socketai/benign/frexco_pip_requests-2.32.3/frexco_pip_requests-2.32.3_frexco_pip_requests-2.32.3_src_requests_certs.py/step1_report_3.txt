{
  "purpose": "This code provides the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package, primarily for use by other modules or scripts that need to verify SSL certificates.",
  "sources": "The code reads the certificate bundle location from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'print(where())' could be used in SSL verification processes, but there are no direct security-sensitive sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'where' from certifi (source), then prints its value (sink), which is a static string indicating the certificate bundle path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical usage patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the certifi package, then, when run as the main program, prints the path to the default CA bundle. There are no user inputs, external data sources, or untrusted data handling. The code performs a simple, well-understood function without any obfuscated logic, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that simply outputs the location of the certifi CA bundle. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks associated with this code snippet.",
