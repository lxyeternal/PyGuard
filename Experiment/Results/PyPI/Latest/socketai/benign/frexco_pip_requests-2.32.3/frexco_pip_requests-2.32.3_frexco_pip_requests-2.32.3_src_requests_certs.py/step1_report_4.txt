{
  "purpose": "This code provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the 'requests' library, specifically fetching it from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location via 'from certifi import where' and when run as main, it prints the result of 'where()'.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' line outputs the CA bundle path, which could potentially be read by untrusted users but does not leak sensitive data.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'where' from 'certifi' to printing the CA bundle path when executed as main.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and intended for obtaining a certificate bundle path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' to retrieve the default CA bundle path. When executed directly, it prints this path. The code is simple, with no input handling, no data transmission, or malicious logic. It appears to be a utility for informational purposes only, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a simple purpose of returning and printing the CA bundle path. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
