  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code simply imports `where` from `certifi` and prints its output.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious intent are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, minimal, and uses reputable libraries.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or external data inputs are present.\n- The purpose is benign: to display the default CA bundle path.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is a utility script for informational purposes.\n- The output could be used downstream but does not leak sensitive data.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- The confidence score is 1 across all reports, which seems appropriate given the clarity and simplicity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk score is 0, as no vulnerabilities or risks are evident.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- All reports are in agreement and appear accurate.\n- The code does not perform any risky operations or contain vulnerabilities.\n- The purpose is well-understood and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is a safe utility script with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation, and poses no security risk. The scores should remain at 0 for malware and security risk, and 0 for obfuscation.",
