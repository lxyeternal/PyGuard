{
  "purpose": "Provides the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from the 'certifi' package and printing it when executed directly.",
  "sinks": "Printing the path to the CA bundle; no data leakage or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "User runs the script; 'where()' is called; path to CA bundle is printed to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and does not contain suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function from a well-known, reputable package (certifi) and outputs its CA bundle path. The code is minimal, with no data inputs from untrusted sources, no handling of secrets, no obfuscated or dynamic code, and no suspicious operations. The purpose is clear, and the code does not perform any actions beyond printing a known resource location.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to report the location of the default CA bundle, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
