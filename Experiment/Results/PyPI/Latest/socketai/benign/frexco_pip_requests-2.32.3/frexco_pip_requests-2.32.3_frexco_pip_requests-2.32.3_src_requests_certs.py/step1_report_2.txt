{
  "purpose": "This script retrieves and displays the default CA certificate bundle path provided by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the import statement and the call to where().",
  "sinks": "The output of the script, which is the path to the CA bundle, can be considered a sink if used elsewhere; however, in this context, it is only printed.",
  "flows": "The code imports the certifi.where function and then, when executed as main, calls and prints its output; no untrusted input is processed or propagated.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward and uses standard library behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known, reputable library (certifi) to obtain the CA bundle path, then prints this path if run directly. There are no dynamic code executions, data manipulations, or external data sources involved. It performs a simple, safe operation with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script's purpose is benign: to display the path to the certifi CA bundle. It does not contain malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity. It appears to be a legitimate utility script.",
