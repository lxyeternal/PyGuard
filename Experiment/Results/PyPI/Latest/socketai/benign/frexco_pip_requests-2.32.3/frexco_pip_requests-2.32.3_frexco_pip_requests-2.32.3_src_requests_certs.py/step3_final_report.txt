  "purpose": "Retrieve and display the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from the 'certifi' package and the call to 'where()' in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The printed CA bundle path; no untrusted data or external data flows are involved.",
  "flows": "The script imports 'where' and, when executed, prints the value returned by 'where()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility that imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints its value when run as a script. It contains no user input, no external data processing, no network activity, and no secrets or obfuscation. The purpose is benign—to display the default CA bundle path. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The malware score is appropriately 0, as there are no malicious behaviors. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting the code's clarity. The security risk score is 0, given the absence of vulnerabilities or security concerns. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is simple, well-understood, and uses reputable libraries. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility script that retrieves and prints the default CA bundle path from 'certifi'. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk present. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
