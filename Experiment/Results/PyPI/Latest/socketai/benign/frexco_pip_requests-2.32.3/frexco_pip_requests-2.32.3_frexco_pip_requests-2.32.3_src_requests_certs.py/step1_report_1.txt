  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'where' function from the 'certifi' library.",
  "sinks": "Printing the path returned by 'where()' to stdout.",
  "flows": "Import 'where' from 'certifi' -> Call 'where()' -> Print the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library 'certifi' to retrieve the default CA bundle path and prints it when executed as a script. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious behaviors, or unusual code constructs. The logic is simple and aligns with standard practices for retrieving CA bundle locations. No external inputs or data processing occurs beyond this retrieval and print operation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility to display the default CA bundle path from 'certifi'. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. It is a simple, safe utility with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
