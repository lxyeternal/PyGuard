  "purpose": "To maintain backwards compatibility by importing certain packages and updating sys.modules to preserve package identity mappings.",
  "sources": "Import statements, reading sys.modules, checking chardet.__name__",
  "sinks": "sys.modules dictionary modifications",
  "flows": "Importing packages -> Updating sys.modules entries for compatibility",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic modification of sys.modules to alias package names, which can be used to hide or manipulate module identities",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet' modules and updates sys.modules entries to map these packages under 'requests.packages' namespace. This practice is often used to maintain compatibility with older code expecting packages under 'requests.packages'. While such dynamic modifications are unconventional, they are a known pattern for compatibility patches. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code. The code solely manipulates module references for compatibility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs harmless package aliasing for compatibility, with no malicious intent. It dynamically updates sys.modules entries but does not include any malicious behavior or security risks.",
