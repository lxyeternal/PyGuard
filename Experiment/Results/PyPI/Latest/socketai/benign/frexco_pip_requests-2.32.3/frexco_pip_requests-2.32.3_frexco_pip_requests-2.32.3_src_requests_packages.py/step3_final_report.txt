  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by aliasing 'urllib3', 'idna', and optionally 'chardet' modules under the 'requests.packages' namespace to ensure legacy code functions correctly.",
  "sources": "Imports of 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet' modules, and their subsequent assignment to sys.modules entries.",
  "sinks": "sys.modules entries where modules are assigned or overwritten, enabling legacy code to access modules via 'requests.packages.*'.",
  "flows": "Importing modules -> assigning module objects to sys.modules['requests.packages.*'] entries -> legacy code referencing these paths.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic manipulation of sys.modules for namespace aliasing; no malicious code, data leaks, or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific packages and reassigns their module objects into sys.modules under a legacy namespace. This pattern is a known compatibility technique, not malicious. No code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. The use of sys.modules manipulation is unconventional but accepted for compatibility. Scores of malware 0 and obfuscated 0 are appropriate; security risk is low (~0.1-0.2) due to potential misuse if environment is compromised, but in this context, it is safe. The code's purpose is solely namespace management, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility shim for legacy support, with no malicious behavior or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate; a slight increase in risk score to around 0.1-0.2 reflects the unconventional pattern but does not indicate danger.",
