{
  "purpose": "To define package metadata and configuration for building and distributing the 'autoprocessor' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters (name, version, author, email, description, url, classifiers, python_requires). No external data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks or code execution. The setup script does not process external inputs or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is declarative and does not process data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is a standard setup.py configuration script with no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup, defines package metadata including name, version, author info, description, URL, classifiers, and Python version requirements. It uses find_packages() to include all packages in the directory. The code is static and standard for Python package setup, with no external input processing, dynamic code execution, or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py script is a standard, benign package configuration file with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It does not contain any malicious code or suspicious patterns.",
