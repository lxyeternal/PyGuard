{
  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'autoprocessor'.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, metadata fields within the setup() function such as name, version, author, email, description, long_description_content_type, url, packages, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; the code primarily configures package metadata and setup parameters.",
  "flows": "The setup() function collects metadata inputs (mostly static strings) and passes them to the setuptools API, with no external data inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; all code is standard for a setup.py file with static configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with static values for package configuration. No dynamic code execution, no input reading, and no suspicious code patterns. It appears to be a straightforward package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is used solely for packaging purposes.",
