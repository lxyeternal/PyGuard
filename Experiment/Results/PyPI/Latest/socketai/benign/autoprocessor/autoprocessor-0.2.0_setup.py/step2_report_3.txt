  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static, standard setup.py script with no dynamic or external input processing.\n- No suspicious code constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or code execution beyond package setup.\n- The malware score is consistently zero across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues in the code:\n- The code matches the description: it's a straightforward setup.py with static metadata.\n- No issues are present in the code based on the reports.\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident. The code follows standard practices.\n- No security flaws or malicious patterns are detected.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk score.\n- The code is purely declarative, static, and follows standard packaging conventions.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify that no external data, dynamic code, or malicious behavior is present.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The high confidence (1) is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assessments are consistent, and no evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe provided setup.py is a typical, safe package configuration script with no security concerns. All reports are accurate in their evaluation. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
