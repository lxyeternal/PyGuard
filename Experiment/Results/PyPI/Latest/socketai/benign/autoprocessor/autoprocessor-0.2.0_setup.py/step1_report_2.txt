  "purpose": "Define package metadata and setup configuration for the Python package 'autoprocessor'.",
  "sources": "None of the lines directly read input or untrusted data; mainly static metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; setup configuration is static.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no runtime data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools setup for packaging a Python project. It includes typical metadata fields such as name, version, author, description, URL, and classifiers. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no environment variable manipulation, no network activity, and no inclusion of third-party library code or embedded malicious logic. It appears to be a normal, well-formed setup script for publishing a package to PyPI.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It simply provides package metadata and configuration.",
