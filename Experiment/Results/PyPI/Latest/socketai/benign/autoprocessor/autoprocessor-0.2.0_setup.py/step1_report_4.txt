  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'autoprocessor' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The setup.py file itself, particularly the 'find_packages()' call and static metadata assignments.",
  "targets": "No explicit untrusted input sources or data sinks; typical setup script for package installation.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from external sources to critical points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code structures. Use of find_packages() is standard. No obfuscated or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks, importing setuptools and calling setup() with static arguments. All parameters are hardcoded, typical of a setup.py file. No external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py file is a standard, benign configuration script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
