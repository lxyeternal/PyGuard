{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, containing static metadata and a call to setup() with no dynamic or malicious code.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded package metadata within the setup() function",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package metadata with static values, and calls setup() with these parameters. There are no dynamic inputs, external data processing, or suspicious constructs. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code aligns with typical packaging scripts and shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static setup.py script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
