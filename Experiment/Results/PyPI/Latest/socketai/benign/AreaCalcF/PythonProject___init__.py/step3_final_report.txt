  "purpose": "Evaluate the security implications of the import statement in the code snippet, focusing on potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "The import statement `import .area` or variations thereof, which reads the 'area' module relatively.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the imported 'area' module if it contains malicious code, or the import statement itself if used to obfuscate malicious intent.",
  "flows": "The import statement loads the 'area' module; if the module contains malicious code, it could execute upon import, but the snippet itself does not show data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Malformed syntax in some reports (`import .area import *`), use of wildcard import, and inconsistent syntax highlighting potential obfuscation or incomplete code snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import, which is common in Python packages. Some reports highlight syntax errors or malformed statements, which could suggest obfuscation or incomplete code. The use of wildcard imports can hide imported entities, but no evidence of malicious behavior or data exfiltration is present. The malware scores are appropriately low (0), and obfuscation scores are justified in cases of syntax anomalies. Overall, the code appears benign, with minor concerns about import practices and syntax irregularities that do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The import statements are standard and do not demonstrate malicious activity. Syntax errors or wildcard usage are not inherently malicious but warrant cautious review. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible.",
