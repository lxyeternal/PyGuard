  "purpose": "Import all components from the 'area' module in the current package",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; no data processing or external communication shown",
  "flows": "No data flow observable; only an import statement present",
  "anomalies": "Use of a relative import with wildcard; no indication of malicious intent but can obscure the imported content",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a wildcard import from a local module named 'area'. This type of import can obscure what code is being imported, which may be used to hide malicious or unintended code. No other code, data input, or external communication is present to evaluate. There is no evidence of malicious behavior in the snippet itself, but the use of wildcard imports reduces code transparency. Since the module's content is unknown, potential malicious behavior could exist within 'area', but based solely on this snippet, there is no explicit malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic import operation with no direct signs of malicious behavior. However, the use of wildcard import from a local module can be considered a potential security concern due to reduced code clarity. No malware or security risks are apparent in this isolated snippet.",
