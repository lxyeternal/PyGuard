  "purpose": "Import all contents from the module '.area'",
  "sources": "Import statement, which loads code from a relative module named '.area'",
  "sinks": "No direct sink present; the import could enable access to potentially malicious code within the module",
  "flows": "Imported module's code is executed upon import, potentially executing malicious or unintended code if present",
  "anomalies": "Use of a relative import with a wildcard, which can import unspecified code, potentially hiding malicious behavior; no explicit code in the snippet itself",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement with a wildcard from a relative module. Without the content of '.area', it's impossible to determine if malicious code is present. The use of wildcard import can obscure what is being imported, which may hide malicious or unintended code. No other code or behaviors are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet by itself is benign, but the use of a wildcard relative import warrants caution, as the imported module may contain malicious code. Without inspecting the '.area' module, the risk cannot be fully assessed.",
