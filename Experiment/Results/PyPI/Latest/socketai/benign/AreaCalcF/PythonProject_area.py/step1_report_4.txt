{
  "purpose": "Calculate the area of geometric figures such as circles and triangles based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters provided via kwargs during object instantiation, specifically 'r' for radius, and 'a', 'b', 'c' for triangle sides.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data outputs or external communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from kwargs input to calculations within calc_area method, with no external data handling or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious dynamic execution or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Area class with a method to compute areas for circles and triangles. It uses math library functions for calculations and includes basic error handling for missing data or invalid inputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears solely focused on geometric calculations without any suspicious side-effects or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended for geometric area calculations. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It is a safe implementation with no apparent security concerns.",
