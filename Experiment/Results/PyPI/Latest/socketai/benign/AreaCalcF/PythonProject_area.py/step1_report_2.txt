{
  "purpose": "Calculate the area of different geometric figures based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: figure_type, r, a, b, c passed via kwargs; potentially user input if integrated with external systems.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code does not send data externally or perform actions that leak data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed to compute area; no data flows to external systems or outputs other than print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The use of print statements instead of exceptions for missing data may indicate poor error handling but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for computing areas of a circle or triangle based on provided parameters. It uses math functions for calculations and handles missing data with print statements. No network access, file operations, or external data interactions are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to normal Python practices for geometric calculations. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The error handling is minimal but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple geometric calculator with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs local calculations based on provided parameters and does not exhibit suspicious or harmful behavior.",
