{
  "purpose": "Calculate the area of geometric figures (circle or triangle) based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters provided via keyword arguments in the constructor (__init__) and accessed in calc_area method.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted data from external sources or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from __init__ parameters to internal variables and then used in calculations within calc_area. No external data flows or network communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code performs straightforward mathematical calculations with standard libraries only.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for computing areas of a circle or triangle, using math functions and conditional logic. It handles missing inputs with print statements and raises NotImplementedError for unsupported figure types. No external input/output, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The structure and use of libraries are standard, and no malicious or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for geometric calculations with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
