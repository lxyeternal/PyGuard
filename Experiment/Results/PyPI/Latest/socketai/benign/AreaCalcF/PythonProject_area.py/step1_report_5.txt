  "purpose": "Calculate the area of geometric figures (circle and triangle) based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters via **kwargs, figure_type attribute.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> calc_area method -> calculation logic -> return or print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed. No external network calls, system modifications, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for calculating areas of a circle or triangle with input validation and exception handling. It uses standard math operations and error handling for missing or invalid input data. There are no external dependencies that could be exploited. The code does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No malicious behaviors such as backdoors, data theft, or hidden code are detected. The exception handling merely prints error messages without exposing sensitive data. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward and secure, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for geometric area calculation with proper input validation and exception handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign utility module.",
