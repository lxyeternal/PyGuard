  "purpose": "Calculate the area of different geometric figures (circle and triangle) based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the kwargs dictionary, specifically 'r' for radius, and 'a', 'b', 'c' for triangle sides.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or security issues; standard print statements are used for error reporting.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are read from kwargs; calculations are performed locally; no external data or network interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code uses standard libraries and practices. Error handling is basic but acceptable.",
  "analysis": "The code implements simple geometric calculations with appropriate error handling for missing parameters or invalid triangles. It does not include any code that executes external commands, manipulates environment variables insecurely, or contains malicious logic. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present. The flow is straightforward: input data (kwargs) → calculations → output or error message. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign geometric utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs basic calculations with standard Python features and appropriate error handling.",
