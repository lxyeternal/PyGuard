  "purpose": "A simple Python class for calculating the area of geometric figures (circle and triangle).",
  "sources": "Input parameters provided via keyword arguments during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from __init__ to calc_area, with internal calculations; no external data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal error handling via print statements; no exceptions raised, but no malicious or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of geometric area calculations for circles and triangles, using standard Python libraries and control flow. It performs local computations with no external dependencies, network activity, or obfuscation. Error handling is minimal but not malicious. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution, are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions suggest a benign utility. The security risk score is very low, and malware and obfuscation scores are zero, consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for calculating areas of circles and triangles. No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
