  "purpose": "A Sudoku solver implementing validation and backtracking with optional randomization for varied solutions.",
  "sources": "Input board passed during instantiation; internal data structures for rows, columns, and grids.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data flows, network activity, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input board -> validation -> recursive backtracking -> output solution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'random.shuffle' to randomize candidate numbers, introducing nondeterminism but not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sudoku solver with validation, move checking, and recursive backtracking. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only unusual aspect is the use of 'random.shuffle', which is common for generating varied solutions but does not pose security risks. The code operates solely on internal data structures without external interactions. The malware score is appropriately 0, as there is no malicious intent. The security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), mainly due to nondeterminism, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward Sudoku solver with no malicious or security concerns. The use of randomness is typical for puzzle variation and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores should be Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0.1.",
