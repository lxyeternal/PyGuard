  "purpose": "This code imports modules related to Sudoku solving, generating, and GUI display, likely for a Sudoku application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .solver, .generator, and .gui",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in the provided code fragment",
  "flows": "No data flow observed; import statements do not process untrusted data or execute code beyond module inclusion",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected in the import statements",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements for three local modules, indicating modular design for a Sudoku application. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and there are no data flows, user inputs, or external communications present. The code appears straightforward and standard for Python projects utilizing modular imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a setup for importing necessary modules. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
