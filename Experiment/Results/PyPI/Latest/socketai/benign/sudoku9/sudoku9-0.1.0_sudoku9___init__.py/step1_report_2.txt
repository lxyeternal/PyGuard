  "purpose": "Import statements for modules related to Sudoku solving, generation, and GUI interface",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; imports modules within the package",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward module imports with relative paths",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three import statements importing modules 'solver', 'generator', and 'gui' from the current package. There is no dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns. All modules appear to be part of a Sudoku application, with no indication of malicious behavior. The code is minimal and structurally standard for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard module imports for a Sudoku application without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
