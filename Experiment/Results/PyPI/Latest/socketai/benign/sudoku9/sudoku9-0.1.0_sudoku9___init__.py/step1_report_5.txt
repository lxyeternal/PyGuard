  "purpose": "Import modules related to solving, generating, and displaying Sudoku puzzles.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are explicitly present in the code; it only imports modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no outputs or data leaks in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are identifiable since the code only contains import statements without data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code behavior are present; the code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three local modules: solver, generator, and gui for a Sudoku application. There are no functions, data handling, or external network connections. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are evident. The snippet is simple and aligns with typical module import patterns for a Python application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a Sudoku application setup.",
