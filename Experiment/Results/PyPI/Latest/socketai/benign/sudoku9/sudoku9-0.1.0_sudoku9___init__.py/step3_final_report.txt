{
  "purpose": "This code imports local modules related to Sudoku functionality, including solver, generator, and GUI components.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data; it only imports modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only performs static imports without runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for local modules, indicating a modular design for a Sudoku application. No malicious activity, data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. The simplicity and standard structure suggest no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard modular import setup for a Sudoku application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
