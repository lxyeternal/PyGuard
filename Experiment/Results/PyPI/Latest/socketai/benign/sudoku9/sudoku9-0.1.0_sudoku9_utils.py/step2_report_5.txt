  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core points:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward utility to display a Sudoku board in the terminal using the 'rich' library.\n- No external data sources, network activity, file I/O beyond display, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code's purpose is purely visual formatting, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Specific points per report:**\n\n**Reports 1-3:**\n- They consistently conclude the code is benign, straightforward, and safe.\n- Confidence levels are high (1), with no suspicion of malware or security risks.\n- They correctly identify that the code uses the 'rich' library for styling and borders.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n\n**Reports 4-5:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9 and 1.0), but still very high.\n- They mention minimal security risk (0.1), which seems to stem from a cautious stance rather than actual issues.\n- They emphasize that no external or untrusted data is involved and that the code is safe.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- All reports agree that the code is safe and free from malware.\n- The only point to note is the minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports, which seems to be a conservative default rather than evidence of actual risk.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate. No malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a score of 0.0 or very close to it is appropriate. The small 0.1 in some reports could be justified as a conservative default, but from a security perspective, it's negligible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a benign, well-structured visualization utility.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary unless a more conservative stance is desired, but based on the evidence, all scores are reasonable.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Final note:** The code does not exhibit any security risks, malware, or obfuscation. It is a safe utility for displaying Sudoku boards in the terminal.",
