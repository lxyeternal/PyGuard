{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to render and display a Sudoku board in the terminal with styled formatting, including borders and cell styling.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'board' parameter passed to the print_board function, which supplies the 2D list of Sudoku cells.",
  "sinks": "Output is the styled ASCII representation of the Sudoku grid displayed via rich.console.Console, which outputs to the terminal. No untrusted data is sent over the network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Input data from the 'board' parameter flows into the format_cell function, which formats each cell for display. The formatted grid is then displayed via console.print, with no data leaving the system externally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated logic; the code uses standard library 'rich' for terminal formatting. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes the 'rich' library to create a styled Sudoku grid, formatting cells with markup and drawing borders with ASCII characters. No dynamic execution, code injection, or external data handling beyond standard display routines. The code is straightforward, with clearly defined functions and no signs of malicious behavior. It solely visualizes provided data without performing any network operations, file I/O beyond display, or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for rendering Sudoku boards in the terminal, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a safe visualization tool without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
