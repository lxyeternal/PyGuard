  "purpose": "The code renders a styled visual representation of a Sudoku board in the terminal using the 'rich' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'board' parameter passed to the 'print_board' function.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted text to the console via 'console.print', which is a standard terminal output, and uses 'rich' library functions.",
  "flows": "Input 'board' data flows through 'format_cell' for styling, then constructs a visual grid with borders, and finally outputs via 'console.print'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code relies solely on standard libraries and straightforward formatting. No malicious behavior or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to visually render a Sudoku board with styling using the 'rich' library. It constructs a grid with borders and styles individual cells based on their content. The input data is read from a function parameter; no external or untrusted sources are used. Output is directed to the console, which is standard. The code uses standard, well-known 'rich' library features and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs such as network calls, code execution, or data exfiltration. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated parts are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward visualization utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to display a Sudoku board with styling, using standard library features. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
