{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to visually display a Sudoku board in the terminal with styled formatting using the rich library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'board' parameter input, which is expected to be a list of lists representing Sudoku rows.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs styled text to the console using rich's Console and Panel, but no untrusted data is sent over the network or stored persistently.",
  "flows": "Input 'board' is formatted and displayed through rich's console output functions; no data flows to external systems or files.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious code are present. The code solely formats and outputs a visual representation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the rich library modules for console output and styling. The 'print_board' function formats a Sudoku grid with decorative borders and styled cells, using nested functions and string formatting. It constructs the grid line by line, inserting different border styles at appropriate rows. The final grid is wrapped in a Panel for display. There are no indications of data collection, network activity, or code that could execute maliciously. The code does not execute external commands, access environment variables maliciously, or handle untrusted inputs in a risky way. It solely renders a visual representation based on the input data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for formatting and displaying a Sudoku board in the terminal, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any network communication, data theft, or backdoor activities. Overall, it is safe from a cybersecurity perspective.",
