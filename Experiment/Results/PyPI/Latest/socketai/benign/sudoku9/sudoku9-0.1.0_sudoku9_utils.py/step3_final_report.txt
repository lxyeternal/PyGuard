  "purpose": "Render a Sudoku board in the terminal with styled formatting using the 'rich' library.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'board' (a 2D list), read during function execution.",
  "sinks": "Display output via console; no untrusted data flow leading to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'board' -> format cells -> construct styled grid -> display via console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that formats and displays a Sudoku grid with styled ASCII borders using the 'rich' library. It reads a 2D list, applies styling to each cell, constructs a grid with borders and dividers, and outputs it to the terminal. No external data sources, network activity, or file I/O beyond display are involved. The code does not perform any malicious actions, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and very low security risk scores (~0 or 0.1). The confidence in these assessments is high (close to 1). Given the lack of malicious or suspicious behavior, the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for visualizing Sudoku boards in the terminal. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk scores assigned are appropriate; they could be set to 0 for maximum accuracy. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
