{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to display a Sudoku board in a styled, formatted manner using the rich library for console output.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'board' input parameter, which is a 2D list of cells. It also reads optional parameters 'title' and 'style' for display customization.",
  "sinks": "The code uses the console.print method from the rich library to output formatted text. No untrusted data is written to files, network, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input 'board' flows through the format_cell function, which processes each cell to produce styled markup, then flows into the console.print call for display.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present. The code is straightforward formatting logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the rich library components for styled console output. It defines a function to format and display a Sudoku board, adding visual dividers for a grid. It uses parameters for styling and title. The function constructs a text-based grid with decorative lines and styled cells, then displays it in a panel. The flow involves reading a 2D list and outputting styled text. There are no external data sources, network connections, or potentially malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign formatting utility for displaying Sudoku boards with styled console output. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. The code is straightforward and uses the rich library for visual output without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
