      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Sudoku puzzle generator with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the overall security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on an external solver and use of non-cryptographic randomness."
