  "purpose": "Generate and remove numbers from a Sudoku grid to create a playable puzzle based on difficulty level.",
  "sources": "Random number generation for grid creation and cell removal; input parameters for difficulty and removal attempts.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted external data; no untrusted data is used in security-critical operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Random seed and removal_attempts influence the number of attempts to remove cells; the grid creation and removal process are internally controlled.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random module is typical; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles Sudoku puzzle generation, including grid creation, validation, and removal of numbers to form a puzzle. It utilizes the 'random' module for variability and a SudokuSolver class for validation. The code does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors are present. It appears to be a straightforward implementation of Sudoku puzzle generation with standard practices. The only external dependency is the imported SudokuSolver, which is presumed to be benign. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Sudoku puzzle generator with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on well-understood randomization and validation techniques without involving external data sources or sensitive information. Overall, it poses low security risk.",
