  "purpose": "Generate and remove numbers from a Sudoku grid to create a playable puzzle of varying difficulty.",
  "sources": "User-configurable difficulty, removal_attempts, random number generation, input parameters for the SudokuSolver.",
  "sinks": "Potential invocation of SudokuSolver.solve() which could be a computational sink but not inherently malicious; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization -> full grid creation -> number removal with validation -> returning puzzle; no external data flows or untrusted input processing outside parameter handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'random' module for randomness, but no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation detected. The SudokuSolver is imported from a relative module, but that is typical. No apparent backdoors or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a Sudoku puzzle generator that creates a complete grid using backtracking, then removes numbers while ensuring the puzzle remains solvable. Randomness is used for variability. The SudokuSolver is invoked solely to validate solvability after removal. No network, file, or external data access observed. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The overall structure appears standard for a Sudoku puzzle generator.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Sudoku puzzle generator without malicious intent. It employs standard techniques for puzzle creation and validation. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
