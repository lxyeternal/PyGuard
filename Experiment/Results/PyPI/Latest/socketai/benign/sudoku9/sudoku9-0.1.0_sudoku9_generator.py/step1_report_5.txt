  "purpose": "Generate Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels with a full grid creation and removal of numbers to form a playable puzzle.",
  "sources": "User inputs for difficulty level, random number generation for grid creation and cell removal, data passed into SudokuSolver for solvability checks.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "Difficulty setting influences number of removal attempts; random choices in grid filling and cell removal; passing puzzle to SudokuSolver for validation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random module for both grid generation and cell removal; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code constructs. SudokuSolver is imported but its internal implementation is unknown; potential concern if it contains malicious code, but cannot be determined from current code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Sudoku puzzle generation: creating a full grid via backtracking, then removing numbers while ensuring the puzzle remains solvable using SudokuSolver. Randomness is used appropriately for variability. No external network calls, file operations, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The imported SudokuSolver's internal behavior is unknown; if it contains malicious code, it could pose a risk, but the current code does not include any such malicious logic. Overall, the code appears to be a standard puzzle generator with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a Sudoku puzzle generator with standard techniques. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected based on the provided code. The only potential concern is dependency on the external SudokuSolver, whose implementation is unknown, but no malicious behavior can be inferred from its usage here.",
