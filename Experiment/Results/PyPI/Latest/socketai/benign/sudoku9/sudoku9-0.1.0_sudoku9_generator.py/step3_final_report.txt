  "purpose": "Generate a solvable Sudoku puzzle by creating a full grid and removing numbers while ensuring solvability through an external solver.",
  "sources": "Random number generation for grid filling and removal attempts; external 'SudokuSolver' for validation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; validation occurs internally via 'SudokuSolver'.",
  "flows": "Randomized grid filling -> removal of numbers -> validation with 'SudokuSolver.solve()' to ensure solvability.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'random' module for puzzle variation; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard techniques for Sudoku puzzle generation, including backtracking for grid creation and random removal with validation. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The external 'SudokuSolver' is assumed benign, used solely for validation. Randomness is typical and not cryptographically secure, which is acceptable for this context. The code is clear, straightforward, and free of obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Sudoku puzzle generator with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the overall security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on an external solver and use of non-cryptographic randomness.",
