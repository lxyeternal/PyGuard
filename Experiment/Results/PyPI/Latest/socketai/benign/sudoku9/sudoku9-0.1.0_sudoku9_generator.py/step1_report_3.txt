  "purpose": "Generate Sudoku puzzles with configurable difficulty by creating a complete grid and removing numbers while ensuring solvability.",
  "sources": "random.randint, random.shuffle, self._find_empty, self._is_valid_move, SudokuSolver (imported from another module).",
  "sinks": "SudokuSolver.solve() (used to verify puzzle solvability).",
  "flows": "random.randint and random.shuffle provide randomness for grid creation and removal attempts; puzzle validation occurs via SudokuSolver.solve() to ensure solvability after number removal.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'random' for non-cryptographic randomness is typical; no hardcoded credentials or secrets. No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or hidden dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code generates a complete Sudoku grid via backtracking and then removes numbers to create a puzzle, checking solvability after each removal using an external SudokuSolver class. No code indicates data leakage, system commands, or malicious network activity. Randomness is used for puzzle variation, but it is standard and not malicious. The code's structure and flow are typical for puzzle generation, with no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sudoku puzzle generator with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It performs legitimate puzzle generation tasks, relying on randomness and a solver class to maintain solvability. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
