  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface and GUI for generating, solving, and playing Sudoku puzzles.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, reads puzzle data from files or input strings, imports modules and classes.",
  "sinks": "File reading (potentially reading malicious files), printing outputs, executing the GUI application.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> Conditional logic -> File reading or string parsing -> SudokuSolver or SudokuGenerator instantiation -> Display outputs or launch GUI.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Uses standard libraries and imports third-party modules without suspicious activity. No obfuscated code or hidden network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages user input via argparse, file reading, and displays outputs. It imports 'rich' for styled printing, 'PyQt6' for GUI, and local modules for Sudoku logic. There are input validations to prevent invalid puzzle sizes. No network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection points are evident. The use of 'sys.exit' after launching GUI is standard. All imported modules are typical and do not show signs of malicious behavior. The file reading uses safe methods, and exception handling is straightforward. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate application for Sudoku puzzle handling with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard Python practices, handles input safely, and does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
