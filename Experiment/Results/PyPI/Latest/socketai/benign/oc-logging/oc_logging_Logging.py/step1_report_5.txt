  "purpose": "Configure logging settings based on environment variables for a Python application.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('LOG_LEVEL') to read the logging level environment variable.",
  "sinks": "dictConfig applies configuration to logging handlers and formatters, affecting how logs are output.",
  "flows": "Environment variable LOG_LEVEL is read (source) and used to set the logging level for handlers and loggers (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious constructs detected. Environment variable handling is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves the LOG_LEVEL environment variable, defaults to 'DEBUG' if not set, and validates its value against allowed levels. It then configures the logging framework using dictConfig, setting up formatters, handlers, and logger levels accordingly. The use of environment variables for configuration is standard and does not pose security risks. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely configures logging based on environment variables without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured logging setup code.",
