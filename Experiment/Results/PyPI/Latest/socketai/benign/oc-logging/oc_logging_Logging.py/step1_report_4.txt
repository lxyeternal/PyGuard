  "purpose": "Configure logging settings for a Python application, including log levels and output formatting.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOG_LEVEL' accessed via os.getenv() to determine log level.",
  "sinks": "The logging configuration outputs to sys.stdout via StreamHandler, which is a standard output stream.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'LOG_LEVEL' influences the log level setting in the logging configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard logging setup with validation of environment variable value.",
  "analysis": "The code reads 'LOG_LEVEL' from environment variables to determine the logging level. It validates that the level is one of the accepted strings. The configuration uses dictConfig to set up log formatting, handlers, and logger levels, including specific settings for 'werkzeug' and 'py.warnings'. The stream handler writes to sys.stdout, and there are no dynamic or insecure operations. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely sets up logging configuration with proper validation. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard logging setup without suspicious behavior.",
