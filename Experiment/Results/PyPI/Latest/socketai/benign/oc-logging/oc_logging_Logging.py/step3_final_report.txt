  "sinks": "Logging output to stdout",
  "flows": "Environment variable LOG_LEVEL influences dictConfig level setting",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward validation and configuration",
  "analysis": "The code reads LOG_LEVEL, defaults to DEBUG, validates the value, and sets up logging via dictConfig with standard formatters and handlers. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The environment variable is a common configuration method, and the code performs proper validation. No suspicious data flows or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is a typical logging setup routine with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure logging configuration with proper validation and no malicious or obfuscated elements. The environment variable usage is safe and common practice. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.",
