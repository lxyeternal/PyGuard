  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be related to data processing or utility functions, but the exact intent is unclear due to lack of comments and context.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables and function arguments; possibly from external files or network if present elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes output to files or network sockets if such code exists elsewhere; no explicit sinks observed in provided code.",
  "flows": "Input sources are processed through functions with no evident untrusted data flow to sensitive sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors identified. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variable names detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python constructs without suspicious patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. Usage of environment variables and data processing appears legitimate. The lack of comments and minimal context prevent full certainty, but based on the available code, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility or processing script with no indicators of malware or security issues.",
