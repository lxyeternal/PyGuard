  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Standard input/output, environment variables, function parameters, and data processing routines.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, network connections, or file operations (not explicitly shown).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or parameters to processing functions, with no suspicious data sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected. No unusual code constructs or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, with benign data handling and no suspicious patterns. No obfuscation or malware signatures are present. The absence of code in some reports limits confidence, but overall, the code is consistent with safe, standard practices. The security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern, and malware scores are zero. Confidence levels are high where code is present and low where code is missing. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. It is a benign component with standard data processing routines. The low security risk and malware scores are justified, and the confidence levels appropriately reflect the available information.",
