{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a demonstration or implementation of a simple utility or function within a Python package, with no explicit malicious intent indicated.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from standard input, environment variables, and possibly external modules or libraries, depending on the specific implementation details (not provided here).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file system writes, or data output functions, which could lead to data leaks if untrusted data is handled improperly. Specific sink points are not detailed in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions or environment variables towards sinks like output functions or network transmission points, passing through various processing steps. Exact paths are unclear without code details.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs were detected based on the provided code snippet. No signs of malicious obfuscation or unusual behavior are observed.",
  "analysis": "The review indicates the code is straightforward, utilizing common Python constructs. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious alone. Absence of hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity reduces concern. Without detailed code, confidence is limited but suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be benign, with no suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities identified. However, more context or code details could improve certainty.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
