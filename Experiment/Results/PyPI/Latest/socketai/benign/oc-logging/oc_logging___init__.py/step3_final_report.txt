  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code snippets and analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data from code snippets, including functions, data flows, environment variables, and network interactions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or system commands that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network sockets, file writes, or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for malicious patterns, suspicious data flows, obfuscation, and security issues. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows were detected. The code appears benign, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious network activity. The confidence in this assessment is high given the lack of suspicious features. The malware score is set to 0, the obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score to 0.2, reflecting minimal perceived threat based on limited context. The reasoning is consistent with the scores assigned.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The supply chain security risk is minimal. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
