  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script, potentially for data processing or utility functions, but the specific intent cannot be fully determined without further context.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet; if present, would typically be from function arguments, environment variables, or external files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are not clearly identified, but typical risks include network connections, file writes, or executing system commands if present.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are evident in the code snippet provided; full flow analysis is limited by incomplete code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code detected. The code structure appears straightforward. However, the absence of context limits thorough anomaly detection.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a simple Python script with no overt malicious functions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. Usage of standard libraries without suspicious patterns suggests low likelihood of malicious intent. Lack of detailed code limits deeper analysis. No obfuscation, code injection, or unusual control flow observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, though limited information prevents a full security assessment. Further context or complete code would enhance confidence.",
