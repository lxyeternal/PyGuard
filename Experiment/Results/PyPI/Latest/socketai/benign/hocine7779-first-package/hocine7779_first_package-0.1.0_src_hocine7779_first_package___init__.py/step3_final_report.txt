  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, network calls, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writes, environment variable access, data output.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation without clear purpose, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code snippets.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly note the absence of code or the inability to analyze. Report 2's high obfuscation warrants a moderate malware score (0.2), justified by the lack of concrete malicious indicators. Other reports show no suspicious patterns, with scores reflecting low risk and no obfuscation. The reasoning aligns with the scores; no significant inconsistencies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are appropriate and consistent with their analyses. Obfuscation in Report 2 justifies a slightly higher concern, but overall, no evidence of malicious activity is detected. The low malware and risk scores across all reports are justified given the evidence.",
