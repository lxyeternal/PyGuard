  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, low-risk repository analysis utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The environment variable handling and cache management are standard. External dependencies' security is outside this code's scope but should be monitored in a supply chain context. Overall, the code and reports are consistent, and the security risk is minimal."
