  "purpose": "Manage cloning, fetching, remote handling, commit retrieval, and diffs for Git repositories and forks.",
  "sources": "Repository URLs, fork info, and local directory paths",
  "sinks": "Git operations (clone, fetch, remote add/remove), directory cleanup",
  "flows": "Input URLs and fork info → remote management and fetches → commit info and diffs",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Git repository management tasks using GitPython, with proper error handling and remote management. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The remote addition/removal logic is sound, and cleanup is standard for temporary clones. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for managing Git repositories and forks, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores are justified and align with the analysis.",
