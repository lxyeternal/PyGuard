  "purpose": "A tool for analyzing Git forks",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks due to lack of code execution",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure; only version string defined; no suspicious or unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The provided code only defines a version string with no functions, logic, or data handling. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks. The code appears to be a simple module header or placeholder for a Git fork analysis tool. No malicious activity or suspicious constructs are present. Lack of additional code limits detailed analysis but also indicates no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal module declaration with no functional logic or suspicious behavior. It is likely a placeholder or initial version of a Git fork analysis tool, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
