{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal placeholder module with a docstring and version variable, likely for initial setup or documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the module docstring and the version variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code contains only static, predefined strings and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module with only a docstring and a version variable. It contains no functions, data processing, input/output, external library calls, or executable logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal nature and lack of external interactions indicate it is a benign placeholder. All signals point to a non-malicious, straightforward code snippet with scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and securityRisk: 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
