{
  "purpose": "The code loads configuration settings for a Python application, primarily for API keys and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (GITHUB_TOKEN, OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_BASE_URL, CACHE_DIR, MODEL, CONTEXT_LENGTH). The .env file (if specified) is loaded via load_dotenv.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables used as API keys; possible use of environment variables that could be sensitive if exposed elsewhere; printing debug info to stderr.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and passed into the Config object; sensitive data flows from environment variables into the application configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code; standard use of environment variables and configuration loading. Debug print statements are present but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment variable reading, conditional logic for selecting API keys, and loading a .env file if specified. It validates presence of required tokens and handles optional configuration parameters. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The debug print statements could reveal sensitive info if logs are accessed improperly but are not inherently malicious. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or harmful actions are present. The logic appears straightforward and typical for configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It properly handles environment variables, validates input, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
