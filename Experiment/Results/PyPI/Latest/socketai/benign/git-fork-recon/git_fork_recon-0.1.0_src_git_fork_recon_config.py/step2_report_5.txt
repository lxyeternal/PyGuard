  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward configuration loader.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behavior is detected.\n- The code handles environment variables securely, with validation and error handling.\n- Debug print statements are present but are typical for development and not malicious.\n- No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- The only minor concern is potential exposure of sensitive info via logs, but this is standard debugging practice.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- **Logic and reasoning:** Sound; the code loads environment variables, prioritizes API keys, and validates inputs.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware score: consistently 0 across reports, which is appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n  - Security risk: low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting typical configuration handling.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:** Correctly set to 0; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** Appropriately low, given the nature of the code.\n- **Potential for false positives:** None apparent; the code is standard configuration loading.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The print statements could expose sensitive info if logs are publicly accessible, but this is a common debugging pattern, not malicious.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Scores are consistent** with the code's behavior.\n- **No changes needed**; the assessments seem accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Estimate:\nGiven the reviews and analysis, I concur with the provided scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** Very low (~0.1-0.2)\n\n**In conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, secure configuration loader with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores reflect its benign nature accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, well-structured, and performs typical environment variable handling.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The current scoring is appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain current scores; no adjustments necessary.",
