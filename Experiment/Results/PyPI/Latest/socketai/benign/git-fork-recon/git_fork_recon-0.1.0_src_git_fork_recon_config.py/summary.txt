  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, straightforward configuration loader with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor concern is debug print statements that could expose sensitive info if logs are accessed improperly. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2 due to potential info leakage via logs. Overall, it is a benign, well-structured configuration setup."
