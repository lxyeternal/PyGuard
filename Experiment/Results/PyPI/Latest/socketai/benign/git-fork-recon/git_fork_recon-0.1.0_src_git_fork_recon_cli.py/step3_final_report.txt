  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for analyzing GitHub repository forks, activity, and generating reports.",
  "sources": "User inputs for repo URL, active_within duration, environment variables, and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "The analyze() function call, which may perform network requests or file operations; URL parsing and environment variable handling.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through parsing functions into analyze(), with validation and setup routines preceding the call.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface that validates inputs, manages cache, and delegates analysis to an external function. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The regex patterns and input handling are standard and safe. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe CLI wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The external analyze() function's security depends on its implementation, but within this snippet, the code is safe and low-risk.",
