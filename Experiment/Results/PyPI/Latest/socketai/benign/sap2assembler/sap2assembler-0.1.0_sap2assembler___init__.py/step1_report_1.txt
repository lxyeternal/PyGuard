  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output sinks present",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow or data processing observed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module metadata (__version__, __author__) and a local import. The import is relative and from a presumably internal module. No input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module initialization snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks evident.",
