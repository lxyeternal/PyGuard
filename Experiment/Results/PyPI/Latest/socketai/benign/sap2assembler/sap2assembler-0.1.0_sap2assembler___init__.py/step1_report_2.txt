  "flows": "No data flow paths identified; code does not process input or output data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports a class from a local module. There are no external data inputs, network connections, or suspicious operations. The import is from a relative module, which is typical in package structure. No indications of malicious activity or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup snippet with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
