  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confirms the code is straightforward, importing a class from a local module, setting version and author variables.  \n- No data flows, no suspicious behavior, no anomalies.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the relative import and metadata.  \n- No external data, no suspicious activity.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Same conclusion, noting the import and metadata setup.  \n- No external data, no malicious behavior.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a minor security risk score (0.1).  \n- Notes that the code is benign, just setting metadata and importing locally.  \n- The slight security risk score seems to be a cautious default, possibly due to the relative import, but no actual issues are identified.  \n**Assessment:** Slightly conservative but reasonable. The code is benign; the minor risk score is acceptable given the context.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Similar to others, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, mainly setting metadata and importing a class from a local module.  \n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:** All are zero, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.  \n- **Risk scores:** Most are zero; one is 0.1, which is acceptable given the minimal nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The malware score should remain at 0 across all reports, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior.  \n- The obfuscated score should be 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- The overall security risk score should be 0, reflecting the benign nature of this code snippet.\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Item | Estimated Score |\n|---|---|\n| Malware | 0 |\n| Obfuscated | 0 |\n| Security Risk | 0 |\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code. No changes needed to the existing scores.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate; no further action is necessary.",
