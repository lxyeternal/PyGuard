{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata and imports a class from a local module",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .assembler import SAP2Assembler'",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; only static import and metadata assignments",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior; relative import could be scrutinized but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, sets version and author metadata. No external data input, no data leaks, no network activity, and no suspicious code. The import statement uses a relative import which is common in package modules. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, serves to set metadata and import a class, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
