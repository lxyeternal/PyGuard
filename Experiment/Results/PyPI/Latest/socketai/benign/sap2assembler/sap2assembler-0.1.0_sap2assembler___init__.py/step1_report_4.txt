{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set module metadata and import a class from a local module, likely for assembling or processing data related to SAP2.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata variables (__version__, __author__) and imports a class from a local module (.assembler).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data processing or untrusted data handling occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources; import statements and metadata do not involve data flow or external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic. The import is relative but standard, and metadata is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version and author metadata, then imports a class from a local module. There are no functions, external input handling, or suspicious operations. The import is local, and no malicious behaviors such as network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration are evident. The code is minimal and appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py or module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, primarily setting metadata and importing a class. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
