{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set metadata for a Python package, specifically importing a class from a local module and defining version and author information.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (assembler), setting __version__ and __author__ variables",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; only internal assignments and import",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a local module, and defines package metadata variables. No external data is read, nor are any untrusted inputs processed. The import is from a relative module, which is typical in package source files. No code execution, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. The structure is straightforward and typical for package __init__.py or similar setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard module initialization snippet with no signs of malicious intent or anomalies.",
