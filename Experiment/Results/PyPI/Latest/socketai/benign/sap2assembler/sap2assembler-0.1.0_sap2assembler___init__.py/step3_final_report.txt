  "purpose": "Set module metadata (__version__, __author__) and import a local class (SAP2Assembler).",
  "sources": "Import statement from .assembler, setting __version__ and __author__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; no untrusted input or output points.",
  "flows": "Import from local module (assembler) with metadata assignment; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, standard for a package's __init__.py or setup, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or external input. The relative import is typical in package code. No signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature; the only minor concern is a small security risk score (0.1) in one report, which is likely an overestimation given the simplicity of the code. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All scores should be set to zero to reflect its safe and standard nature.",
