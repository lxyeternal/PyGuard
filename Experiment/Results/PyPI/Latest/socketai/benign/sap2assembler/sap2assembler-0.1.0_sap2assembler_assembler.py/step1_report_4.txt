{
  "purpose": "The code implements an assembler for the SAP2 architecture, converting human-readable assembly instructions into binary machine code and managing label references, address calculations, and file I/O.",
  "sources": "File input (fileToAssemble), reading assembly source code from a specified file; reading and parsing lines of code; handling label definitions; parsing numeric literals from strings.",
  "sinks": "Writing assembled binary code to a file; printing assembled code in hex or binary format to the console.",
  "flows": "Source input (file reading) -> parsing and label identification -> address calculation -> mnemonic and operand conversion -> binary code assembly -> output to file or console.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external network activity detected. The code performs standard assembly processing without obfuscation or malicious constructs. No dynamic code execution, eval, or subprocess calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a CPU assembler for a specific architecture, with no signs of malicious behavior. It reads an assembly source file, processes labels, pseudo-instructions, and mnemonics, and outputs binary code either to a file or the console. All data handling is confined to file I/O and data structures. There are no external network calls, code injection points, or hidden behaviors. The only potential security consideration is ensuring that input files are trusted, as malicious assembly code could potentially trigger unintended behavior if used maliciously, but this is typical for an assembler and not malicious code per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard assembler implementation with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Its functions are related to converting assembly code to binary and managing addresses and labels. No security concerns are identified beyond typical file handling considerations.",
