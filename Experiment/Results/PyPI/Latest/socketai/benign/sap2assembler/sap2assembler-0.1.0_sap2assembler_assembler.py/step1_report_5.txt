{
  "purpose": "The code is an assembler for the SAP2 architecture, converting assembly language instructions into machine code and saving or displaying the assembled binary data.",
  "sources": "Reads input assembly code from a file specified by 'fileToAssemble'; reads assembly instructions from the file's content; reads and processes lines for labels, pseudo-instructions, and mnemonics.",
  "sinks": "Writes assembled binary code to a file specified by 'fileToWrite' via 'saveAssembledCode'; outputs data to console via 'printAssembledCode'.",
  "flows": "Reads assembly code from file -> parses and identifies labels and instructions -> converts instructions to machine code -> stores in 'assembledCode' array -> writes to output file or prints to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret keys; no use of network operations; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected; file paths are taken from parameters, not hardcoded. The code performs file I/O and data processing in a straightforward manner.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as an assembler, converting textual assembly instructions into binary machine code stored in an array. It reads input from files, processes labels, pseudo-instructions, and mnemonics, and outputs binary data. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present. It does not contain malicious payloads, nor does it manipulate environment variables or system files beyond reading and writing specified files. The code appears clean and purpose-specific, with standard I/O operations and logical flow. It relies on provided files and user input parameters without executing or fetching external data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, purpose-built assembler with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It performs standard file processing and binary encoding of assembly instructions securely. No anomalies or malware indicators are present.",
