  "purpose": "This code implements a Python class for assembling SAP2 assembly language into machine code, handling label resolution, pseudo-instructions, and file I/O operations.",
  "sources": "Reads assembly source code from input files, processes lines for labels, mnemonics, pseudo-instructions, and operands.",
  "sinks": "Outputs assembled binary or hexadecimal code to files or console; no external network or system commands are used.",
  "flows": "Source lines are parsed for mnemonics and labels; label addresses are stored; instructions are converted to opcodes; address counter is incremented; final code is written to output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard assembly tasks with clear, well-structured logic. It reads input files, processes labels and pseudo-instructions, converts mnemonics to opcodes, manages addresses, and writes output. No external network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. The security posture is consistent with a benign assembler; no hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure assembler for the SAP2 architecture. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
