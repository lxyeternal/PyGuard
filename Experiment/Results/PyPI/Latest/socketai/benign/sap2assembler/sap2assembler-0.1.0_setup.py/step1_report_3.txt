  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'sap2assembler' Python project on PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external data flows observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'README.md' file read operation into the long_description parameter.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md').read() without validation could pose risks if the file content is manipulated, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads the README.md file for the long description, which is standard practice. No external input is processed during runtime. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and adheres to common packaging practices. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in the code.",
