  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'sap2assembler' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'README.md' file for 'long_description'. No other input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The 'long_description' content is used during package setup and is not a security sink. No untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'README.md' file into the 'long_description' parameter during setup; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard setup tasks with no suspicious or unusual patterns; reading the README file is typical for package description.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README file to include a long description and specifies package metadata. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or external data transmissions. All components serve typical setup purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It follows standard practices for Python package configuration.",
