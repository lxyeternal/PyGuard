  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools.\n- The only potentially suspicious activity noted is reading 'README.md' without validation or error handling.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, user input, or other malicious behaviors are observed.\n- The code does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The malware score is consistently zero across all reports, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- The security risk is also zero, given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n- Reading 'README.md' without validation is common and not inherently dangerous in this context.\n- No external data inputs or outputs are involved that could lead to security issues.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in reasoning:\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the script.\n- The only minor point is that reading files without error handling could be improved, but this does not impact security.\n- No overestimations or underestimations of risk are evident.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n- The **malware score** is appropriately 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The **security risk** score is also 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n- The **obfuscated** score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The **risk score** is 0, reflecting the lack of any security concern.\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a typical setup script with no security issues.\n- The only minor concern is the lack of error handling when reading files, but this is unrelated to security.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\nBased on all the information, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's benign nature and adherence to standard packaging practices.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe setup.py script is safe, straightforward, and poses no security risks. No further action or concern is warranted.",
