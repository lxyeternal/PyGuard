  "sources": "Read access to 'README.md' file to load the long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or user input handling present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static configuration for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without error handling; no suspicious code or hidden logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and repository info. The only I/O operation is reading a markdown file for the long description, which is typical and safe. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. There are no obfuscated parts or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It adheres to standard practices without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
