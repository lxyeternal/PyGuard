{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to import all definitions from the current package/module, typically to reuse functions, classes, or variables defined elsewhere within the package.",
  "sources": "The source is the current module/package, specifically the import statement that brings in all symbols from the current package.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks; this code does not process or output data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this single import statement, as it only imports symbols into the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a wildcard import statement, which can obscure dependencies and make security analysis difficult, but does not inherently indicate malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, containing only a 'from . import *' statement. Such wildcard imports are often discouraged due to namespace pollution and potential maintenance issues, but they do not perform any malicious actions by themselves. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscated code present. The lack of further context limits the ability to assess overall security, but this line alone is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard import operation with no evidence of malicious behavior. It could pose maintainability or security risks if overused, but it is not malicious in itself.",
