{
  "purpose": "The code imports all modules and symbols from the current package, which is typically used to aggregate or expose package contents.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package (from . import *).",
  "sinks": "Potentially any part of the imported modules; no direct sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The import could introduce various flows if imported modules have malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this line alone.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can hide which symbols are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code, but alone it is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a wildcard import from the current package, which is common but can be risky if the package contains malicious or untrusted modules. No other code or logic is present to analyze further. No evidence of malware or suspicious behavior is observable in this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no immediate signs of malicious intent. However, the use of 'import *' can obscure imported content, which might be risky if the package is compromised or malicious. No direct malware or malicious activity is detected based solely on this snippet.",
