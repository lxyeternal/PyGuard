{
  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from the current package/module, which is a common practice in Python for re-exporting or simplifying imports within a package.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement from the current package/module.",
  "sinks": "This code itself does not contain any data sinks or untrusted data handling; it only performs an import operation.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists within this single line of code since it only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from . import *' can be considered suspicious in certain contexts because it can hide imported symbols, potentially making the code harder to analyze or obfuscate intent. However, it is a known pattern in Python packages and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from the current package/module using a relative import. This practice can lead to namespace pollution and obscure dependencies but is not in itself malicious. No input/output operations, data handling, or network activity are present. There is no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent based solely on this line.",
  "conclusion": "This line of code is a standard package import statement with no evident malicious behavior. It does not involve data leaks, code injection, or malicious actions, but the use of 'import *' could be flagged as a potential issue for code clarity or maintenance, not security.",
