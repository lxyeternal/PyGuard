{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a relative module, likely to include functions, classes, or variables into the current namespace.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which reads the contents of a relative module (from the current package).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this single line of code, as it only performs a module import.",
  "flows": "There is no data flow from untrusted input to any sink within this line; the import may load code from another module, but this is standard behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from . import *' is generally discouraged because it can import unwanted or malicious code if the module itself is compromised. However, on its own, it does not execute malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "This code is a minimal import statement that pulls all symbols from a relative module. Without further context, it’s a benign Python construct used for module organization. It does not execute any logic, network calls, or data handling directly. No evidence of malicious intent or malicious code behavior is present here. The only potential concern is the broad import which could include malicious code if the imported module is compromised, but this cannot be assessed from this single line.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python import statement with no immediate signs of malicious behavior. Its security implications depend on the content of the imported module, which is not provided. No malware or security risks are evident from this snippet alone.",
