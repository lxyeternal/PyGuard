{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import all modules and objects from the current package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the current package's __init__.py or module files.",
  "sinks": "The import itself is a sink, but no data is being transferred or executed from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident; the code merely performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'from . import *' can hide which modules or objects are imported, potentially masking malicious code or unwanted behavior, but on its own, it is a common pattern in package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement. This pattern is typical in package __init__.py files to re-export symbols. It does not contain any code that processes input, performs network operations, or executes untrusted code. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. However, the use of '*' import can hide imported symbols, but this alone is not malicious. No other code or context is provided to suggest malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal import statement with no apparent malicious or security issues. The pattern itself is benign but can be risky in larger contexts if it obscures imported symbols. Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malware or security threats.",
