  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their assessments, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from . import *`.\n- They agree that this is a standard package import pattern, often used in `__init__.py` files.\n- None mention any actual malicious activity, code execution, or data flow.\n- The primary concern highlighted is the use of `import *`, which can obscure dependencies and potentially hide malicious code if the imported modules are compromised.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that it imports all definitions from the current package.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes that this line alone isn't malicious but can pose maintainability/security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.8, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The scoring seems reasonable. The security risk is low but non-zero due to the potential for obscured dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Emphasizes that it's typical in package `__init__.py` files, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with standard Python practices. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Notes that the broad import could include malicious code if the module is compromised, but this cannot be determined from the line alone.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.4, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The lower confidence (0.4) reflects uncertainty about the module's trustworthiness. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Similar to others, with emphasis on potential namespace pollution but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.1, Confidence: 0.8, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly lower security risk score (0.1) is reasonable, given the potential for namespace pollution but no actual threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Similar reasoning, with emphasis on obscured content and potential risks if the package is compromised.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.3, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The low confidence (0.3) is justified, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) is reasonable; the risks are mainly related to maintainability and potential namespace pollution, not active threats.\n- **Confidence Levels:** Varying from 0.3 to 0.9, reflecting the certainty about the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Adjustments**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** across all reports. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should stay at **0**; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly increase the lowest confidence report's risk score from 0.1 to 0.2 for consistency, as the potential for hidden dependencies exists, especially if the imported modules are compromised.\n- **Confidence:** The scores seem reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Expert Estimate**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — straightforward import statement.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.2** — low but non-zero, mainly due to the use of `import *`, which can obscure dependencies and make security analysis harder.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No significant adjustments are necessary beyond minor standardization of the security risk score.",
