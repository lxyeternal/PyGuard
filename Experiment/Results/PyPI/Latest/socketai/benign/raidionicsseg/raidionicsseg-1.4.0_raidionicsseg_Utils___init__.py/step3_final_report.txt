{
  "purpose": "A relative wildcard import from the current package, typically used in __init__.py files to re-export symbols.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the import simply brings symbols into the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative wildcard import, common in package initialization files. It does not execute code, access external resources, or contain any malicious constructs. The primary concern is maintainability and namespace pollution, not security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this line, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2). Confidence levels are high given the simplicity of the code. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The main concern is maintainability, not security. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
