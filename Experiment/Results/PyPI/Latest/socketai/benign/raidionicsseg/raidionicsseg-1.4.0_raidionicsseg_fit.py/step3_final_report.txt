{
  "purpose": "The code orchestrates ML inference workflows for segmentation or classification tasks, handling configuration, data preprocessing, model inference, reconstruction, and output dumping.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files, input data folders, model paths, and optional logging files; accesses the filesystem for models and data.",
  "sinks": "Writes logs, prediction outputs, and classification results to disk; no network communication or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration loading -> Data preprocessing -> Model inference -> Reconstruction (for segmentation) -> Data dumping to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or network activity detected. Uses standard libraries and multiprocessing with Windows support.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard ML inference pipeline with proper process management and logging. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external communication. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to file handling and logging, which are typical in such workflows. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured inference pipeline with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a safe implementation.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
