  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the current package/module, likely to make them available in the current namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statement that reads module data during runtime.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks detected within this line.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads code symbols into memory; no data flow identified beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from . import *' can obscure which symbols are imported, potentially hiding malicious code, but on its own, it is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports all symbols from the current package/module. While 'import *' is discouraged for code clarity and maintainability, it does not inherently contain malicious behavior. Since there are no other code lines, no suspicious activities, hardcoded secrets, or data leaks are evident. The absence of additional code makes it impossible to evaluate further malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic import operation with no direct malicious behavior or security risks detected in this line. However, the use of 'import *' could mask malicious or unintended imports if present elsewhere.",
