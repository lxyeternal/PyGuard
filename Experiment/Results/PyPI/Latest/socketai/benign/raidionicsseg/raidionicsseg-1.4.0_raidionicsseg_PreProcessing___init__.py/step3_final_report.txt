  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the current package/module, typically used in package initialization files.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the import brings symbols into the namespace but does not involve untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' can obscure imported symbols, but no malicious or suspicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from the current package, a common pattern in __init__.py files. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or external interactions. The use of 'import *' is discouraged for maintainability but is not inherently malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (around 0.1-0.2). The scores are consistent with the minimal and straightforward code, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, representing a standard package initialization pattern. There is no malicious behavior or security threat present. The use of 'import *' poses a maintainability concern but not a security risk in this context. The scores across reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
