{
  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from the current package/module, likely for consolidating or re-exporting functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from . import *' which reads symbols from the current package/module.",
  "sinks": "None directly visible; no untrusted data processing or external data leaks evident from this statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from an import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be considered unusual or bad practice as it obscures what is imported, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a wildcard import from the current package. This can hide the actual imported symbols, making it harder to audit. No code execution, data handling, or network activity is present in this snippet. Without additional context or code, it is impossible to identify malicious intent. The code's minimal nature prevents any concrete malicious indicators, but the use of 'import *' is generally discouraged for maintainability and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a single import statement with no explicit malicious behavior. It is a common pattern in package __init__.py files for re-exporting symbols but can obscure actual dependencies. No evidence of malware or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
