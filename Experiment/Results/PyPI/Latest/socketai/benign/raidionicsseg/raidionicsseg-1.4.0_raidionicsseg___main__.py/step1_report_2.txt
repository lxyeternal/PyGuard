  "purpose": "This script initializes and runs a model based on a provided configuration file, handling command-line arguments and logging.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), configuration file path (via argparse), and platform information (platform.system()).",
  "sinks": "Calls run_model with the configuration filename; logs messages; prints traceback on exceptions.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> argparse validation -> run_model() call with config filename -> logging and exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious external calls. The code properly validates file existence. Logging levels are dynamically set based on user input. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard command-line argument parsing with validation for the configuration file existence. It sets up logging and conditionally adjusts verbosity. It includes a safe call to run_model, passing the validated config filename. Exception handling captures and prints tracebacks. Platform-specific code for Windows support is appropriate. No signs of malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, legitimate CLI wrapper around a model-running function with proper input validation and logging. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
