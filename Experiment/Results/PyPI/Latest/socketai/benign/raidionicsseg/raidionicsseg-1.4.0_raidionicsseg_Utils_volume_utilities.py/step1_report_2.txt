{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for medical image processing, including file disambiguation, volume resizing, intensity normalization, clipping, padding, masking, cropping, and activation functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input filenames for image data, uses sitk.ImageFileReader().Execute() to load images, and reads parameters for normalization and clipping methods.",
  "sinks": "Returns processed image volumes, performs padding, normalization, clipping, and transformations, but does not write data or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Reads image files via sitk, processes volumes through normalization, clipping, resizing, and padding functions. No external network communication or data exfiltration present.",
  "anomalies": "Code includes commented-out sections that could potentially alter behavior if enabled, but currently inactive. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles medical image data, performing standard preprocessing steps such as normalization, resizing, and padding. No code sections indicate malicious intent like data exfiltration or unauthorized system access. Functions for masking and cropping are placeholders without implementation, but they do not contain suspicious code. No external network calls, system modifications, or backdoors are present. The only noteworthy aspect is that the functions rely on parameters and data inputs without external communication. The code appears benign and typical for a medical imaging pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard medical imaging preprocessing script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It contains placeholder functions that need implementation, but nothing suspicious or harmful was detected.",
