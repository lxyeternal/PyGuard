{
  "purpose": "Functions for medical image processing including disambiguation, normalization, resizing, padding, and activation functions, primarily for MRI and CT images.",
  "sources": "Image files read via sitk.ImageFileReader, data passed as function parameters, and potentially external image files.",
  "sinks": "No network or external data transmission; data flows are internal within processing functions.",
  "flows": "Input filenames are read to produce image arrays; data is processed through normalization, resizing, padding, and activation functions within memory.",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder functions (`volume_masking`, `volume_cropping`) are unimplemented; commented code is present but inactive; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard medical image processing tasks using common libraries (numpy, sitk, skimage). No network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. Placeholder functions could be exploited if later maliciously implemented, but in current form, they are benign. Commented code appears to be for debugging or future features. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard for medical imaging workflows, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. Placeholder functions are inactive and do not pose an immediate threat. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The overall assessment indicates a safe, transparent codebase.",
