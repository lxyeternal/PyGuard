  "purpose": "Configuration parser and environment setup utility for a medical imaging pipeline.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files, environment variables (CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER, CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES), and file existence checks for mask files.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; environment variables are set based on config files, but this is standard practice.",
  "flows": "Configuration options influence environment variables and class attributes; no malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward configuration handling with standard validation and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical configuration parsing, environment variable setting, and validation without executing untrusted code or network activity. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The environment variables are used as intended in GPU-accelerated workflows. Minor issues include a non-critical bug in the __str__ method of the Enum class, but this does not impact security. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration management module for a medical imaging pipeline. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and poses minimal security risk. The low risk score reflects standard practices in GPU-based ML workflows, with no evidence of supply chain vulnerabilities.",
