{
  "purpose": "The code imports all modules and definitions from the current package, which is typically used to consolidate or expose package components.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current module or package namespace during import.",
  "sinks": "The import statement itself does not directly involve untrusted data or external effects, but it may lead to the execution of other code when the package is imported.",
  "flows": "Importing triggers execution of the imported modules' code, which may contain additional data flows or behaviors.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from . import *' is generally discouraged because it can obscure which components are imported and can lead to namespace pollution; however, it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a wildcard import from the current package. It does not contain any malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors itself. The import may cause execution of other modules' code within the package, which could potentially contain malicious or insecure code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone. No obfuscation, malware, or security risks are evident solely from this statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no direct malicious behavior or security risks. Its potential security implications depend on the contents of the imported modules, which are not provided here.",
