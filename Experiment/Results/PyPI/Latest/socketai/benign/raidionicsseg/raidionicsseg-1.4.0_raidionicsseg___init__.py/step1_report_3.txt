{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import all components from the current package/module.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement itself, which reads the current package/module's namespace.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this code snippet, as there is no data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable; the import statement loads all symbols into the current namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a wildcard import ('from . import *') is considered bad practice, as it can import unintended or malicious code without clear visibility. However, it alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a relative import of all components from its package/module. Since it contains only this import statement and no further code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The wildcard import may obscure malicious or harmful code if present in the imported module, but the snippet itself is benign. The lack of additional logic limits the scope of analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple relative import statement with no explicit malicious or suspicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of a wildcard import, which can lead to namespace pollution and potentially hide malicious code within the imported module, but based solely on this snippet, there is no direct evidence of malicious intent.",
