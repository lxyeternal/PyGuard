  "purpose": "This code imports all definitions from a local module within the same package, likely to reuse functions, classes, or variables defined there.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module ('.'), which could contain any code or data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially any part of the imported module if it contains untrusted data or functions; however, the import itself does not constitute a sink.",
  "flows": "The import makes all definitions from the local module available in this namespace, but there are no explicit data flows, inputs, or outputs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only a wildcard import; no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident from this fragment alone.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of all contents from the current package's module. This is a standard Python practice to include local module components. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues in this single line. Without additional context or code, no malicious activity or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with no apparent malicious intent. It is a common Python pattern to include local module content. No security risks or malware indications are identified from this code fragment.",
