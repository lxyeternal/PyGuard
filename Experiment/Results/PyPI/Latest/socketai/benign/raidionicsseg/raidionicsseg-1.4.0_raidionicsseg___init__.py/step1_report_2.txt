{
  "purpose": "The code imports all modules and symbols from the current package/module.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which reads the current package/module contents.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs a package import with no data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from . import *' can hide imported symbols, making static analysis difficult. No other anomalies are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement importing all symbols from the current package. This pattern is common but can be risky if combined with malicious modules, as it can mask malicious imports or side-effects. No further code is present to evaluate for malicious behavior. The simplicity suggests low likelihood of embedded malware but warrants caution if the package content is untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement; no malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this fragment alone. However, the use of 'import *' can obscure module contents and should be scrutinized if the package is untrusted.",
