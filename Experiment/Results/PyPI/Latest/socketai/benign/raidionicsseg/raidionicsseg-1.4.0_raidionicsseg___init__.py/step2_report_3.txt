  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom . import *\n```\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code performs a relative import of all symbols from the current package/module.\n- It is a common Python pattern but is discouraged due to namespace pollution and potential obscuration of imported components.\n- The snippet itself contains no direct malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.\n- The security implications depend heavily on the contents of the imported module/package, which are unknown here.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign, and no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)\n- **Note:** The confidence is high (1.0). No change needed.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Correct. Use of `import *` can obscure symbols and pose risks if the package is untrusted.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct, no direct malware detected)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (reasonable, given the potential for obscured malicious code)\n- **Note:** The confidence is 0.6, which seems appropriate. No change needed.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The use of `import *` is discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (appropriate)\n- **Note:** Confidence at 0.6 seems reasonable.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The practice can hide malicious imports, but the snippet alone is benign.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (appropriate)\n- **Note:** Confidence at 0.5 is slightly lower; given the caution around `import *`, perhaps 0.6 is more consistent.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The import alone doesn't indicate malicious behavior; the actual risk depends on the imported modules.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (reasonable)\n- **Note:** Confidence at 0.7 is acceptable, given the potential risks of namespace pollution.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Scores and Justifications\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is directly observable.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is reasonable since the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Uniformly low (0.2), reflecting the potential for issues due to the use of `import *`, but not indicating actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations\n- The scores are consistent and justified based on the code snippet.\n- The primary concern with such import statements is their potential to hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised, but no evidence of this exists here.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate\nGiven the uniformity and the nature of the code, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to the general risk associated with wildcard imports, especially if the package is untrusted)\n\n**Note:** If additional context or code from the imported module becomes available, these scores might need adjustment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code itself is benign, with potential security concerns stemming from the practice of wildcard imports, but no direct malicious activity is evident.",
