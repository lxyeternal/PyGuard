  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the accuracy of their assessments, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a benign relative import with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.0\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nThis is a straightforward import statement with no suspicious behavior. The confidence score of 1.0 aligns with the analysis. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Import all symbols from the current package; use of 'import *' can be risky but no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.6\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nThe low malware score (0) is appropriate given the code snippet. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects some concern about the use of 'import *', which can obscure malicious imports if the package is untrusted. The confidence score of 0.6 seems reasonable, given the minimal context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 2, emphasizes that 'import *' can be suspicious but no direct malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.6\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nConsistent with previous reports. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but not inherently malicious. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to above, highlights that 'import *' can hide malicious imports but no evidence in this snippet.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.5\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nAgain, consistent. The confidence is slightly lower, which is acceptable given the limited context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Importing from the current package; potential to execute other modules' code but no direct malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.7\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with previous assessments. The risk score is justified given the potential for imported modules to contain malicious code, but the snippet itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple relative import.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign malware=0, which is justified given the snippet.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** The 0.2 risk score assigned across reports reflects cautious concern about 'import *' practices, which is appropriate.\n- **Confidence levels:** Varying from 0.5 to 1.0, reflecting the amount of context.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable given the limited code context.\n- No adjustments needed unless additional context suggests malicious content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated overall risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code snippet is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised, but there is no evidence of this here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The scores are justified based on the minimal code snippet and the potential risks associated with wildcard imports.",
