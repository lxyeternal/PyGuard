{
  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from a relative module, likely to include functions, classes, or variables for use within the current module.",
  "sources": "The source is the relative import statement 'from . import *', which pulls in all definitions from a sibling module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet since it only performs an import; no untrusted data handling or output occurs here.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows or source-to-sink paths within this snippet, as it only imports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' can be considered suspicious or discouraged because it can hide imported symbols, making the code less transparent and potentially hiding malicious or unintended imports. However, in isolation, this is not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement. This practice can sometimes be used to obfuscate what is being imported, especially if the imported module contains malicious code. However, without access to the imported module, it's impossible to determine if malicious behavior exists. The snippet itself does not contain any malicious payload, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The overall security concern stems from the use of 'import *', which reduces code clarity and could hide malicious imports if the imported module is compromised. No other anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or malicious code snippets are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet by itself is not inherently malicious but uses a potentially risky import practice ('import *') that could conceal malicious behavior if the imported module is compromised. No direct malicious activity is evident from this fragment alone.",
