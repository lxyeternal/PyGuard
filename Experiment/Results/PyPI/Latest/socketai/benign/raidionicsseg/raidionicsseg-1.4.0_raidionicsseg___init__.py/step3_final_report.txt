  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the current package/module using a relative import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the statement imports symbols into the namespace but does not execute or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from a sibling module, which is a common but discouraged practice due to namespace pollution. The snippet itself contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The security concern primarily relates to the imported module's contents, which are unknown. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and risk score to 0.2, reflecting cautious concern about namespace pollution but no direct evidence of malicious activity. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0), given the simplicity of the code and lack of external context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard relative import. While the use of 'import *' can hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised, there is no evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
