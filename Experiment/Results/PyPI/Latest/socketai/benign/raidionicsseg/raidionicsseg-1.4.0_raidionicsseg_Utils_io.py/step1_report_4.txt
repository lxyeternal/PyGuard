{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load, convert, process, and save medical imaging data and predictions related to neuroimaging analysis.",
  "sources": "File system reads via nib.load(), sitk.ReadImage(), and open() functions; data is read from input file paths and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Writes files to disk with nib.save(), sitk.WriteImage(), and open(). Potentially unsafe if input paths are manipulated, but no direct untrusted data is written to sensitive locations without validation.",
  "flows": "Input files are read into memory; predictions and data are processed and saved to specified directories; no untrusted data flows directly into system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual obfuscated code detected. Use of standard libraries and straightforward file operations. No evident malicious logic or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing tasks: loading NIfTI files, converting images, and saving predictions. It handles common shapes and data formats appropriately. The functions use external libraries (nibabel, SimpleITK) as intended without suspicious overrides. Exception handling is present, but it only logs errors and raises exceptions without malicious side effects. There are no signs of malware or malicious data exfiltration, nor any dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign medical imaging processing module. It performs typical data I/O operations and prediction saving routines without evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. No security risks or malware indicators are detected.",
