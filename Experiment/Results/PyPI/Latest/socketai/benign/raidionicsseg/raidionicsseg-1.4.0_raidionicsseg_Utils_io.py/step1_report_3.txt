{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for loading, converting, and saving medical imaging data and predictions related to neuroimaging analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads image files using nibabel and SimpleITK; reads and writes files to disk; reads configuration parameters from an imported module.",
  "sinks": "Writes prediction and classification result files to disk; reads image files from disk; potentially writes to any specified storage path.",
  "flows": "Loads image data from disk via nib.load() or sitk.ReadImage(); processes predictions; saves output images and CSV files based on predictions and parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected. The code performs standard data I/O and processing tasks with no obfuscated or misleading constructs. No external network calls or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly handles loading medical image data, converting images between formats, and dumping prediction results to disk in standard formats. No use of untrusted input for system commands or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or covert channels, is observed. Error handling via exceptions is standard, and no hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The use of configuration parameters appears normal. All file operations are confined to specified paths, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard medical imaging processing and prediction dumping module with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is well-structured for its purpose and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
