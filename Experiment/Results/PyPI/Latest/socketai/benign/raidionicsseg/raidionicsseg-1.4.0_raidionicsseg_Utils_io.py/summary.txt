  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for neuroimaging data handling and prediction storage. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with typical file I/O routines in such applications."
