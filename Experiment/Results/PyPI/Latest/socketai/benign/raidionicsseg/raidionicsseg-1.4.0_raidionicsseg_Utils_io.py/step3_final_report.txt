{
  "purpose": "The code handles loading, converting, and saving neuroimaging data and predictions, primarily for medical imaging workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads input files via nib.load and sitk.ReadImage; accesses parameters and configuration data; reads/writes image and CSV files.",
  "sinks": "Writes prediction images and classification results to disk; outputs CSV files and NIfTI images.",
  "flows": "Source files are loaded, processed, and then saved as output images or CSVs; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected; standard error handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard neuroimaging data I/O and processing using well-known libraries (nibabel, SimpleITK). It includes proper error handling and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious logic. No external network calls or code injection points are present. The file paths are constructed straightforwardly, and no hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident. The functions serve typical purposes in medical imaging pipelines, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for neuroimaging data handling and prediction storage. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with typical file I/O routines in such applications.",
