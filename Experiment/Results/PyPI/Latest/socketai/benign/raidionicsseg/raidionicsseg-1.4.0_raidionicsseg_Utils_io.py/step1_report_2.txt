{
  "purpose": "The code handles loading, converting, and saving neuroimaging data and prediction results, primarily in NIfTI format, for medical imaging applications.",
  "sources": "Data sources include file paths for loading images (`nib.load`, `sitk.ReadImage`) and parameters for prediction and output directory paths (`storage_path`).",
  "sinks": "Output files are written using `nib.save` and file writes in CSV format, with no apparent untrusted data sinks. File paths are constructed from input parameters and filenames.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input file reading (`nib.load`, `sitk.ReadImage`) to data processing and then to output file writing (`nib.save`, CSV files). There are no evident untrusted data flows leading to insecure or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation are present. Use of `traceback.format_exc()` in exception logs is standard for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code reads medical imaging data from files using established libraries (`nibabel`, `SimpleITK`). It processes predictions and saves output images and CSV files based on runtime parameters. No suspicious data manipulation or dynamic code execution is observed. Exception handling logs errors and raises exceptions properly. No signs of malicious intent such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data processing and saving script for medical imaging applications. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It functions as intended for its domain without evident malicious intent or supply chain threats.",
