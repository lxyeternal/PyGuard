{
  "purpose": "The code performs medical image preprocessing tasks including loading NIfTI volumes, resampling, background cropping, normalization, resizing, and handling multiple inputs for inference.",
  "sources": "File loading from specified filenames, input data passed as numpy arrays in diffloader function.",
  "sinks": "Processed volume data in memory; no external network or system calls observed.",
  "flows": "Loading data from files -> resampling -> cropping/background removal -> normalization -> resizing -> optional transposition -> output data.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code sections and unused variables are present but are typical placeholders; no suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard medical image preprocessing procedures. It loads NIfTI files, resamples to desired spacing, applies background cropping for CT or MRI, normalizes intensities, resizes volumes, and optionally transposes data. No external network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Commented code and unused variables are benign. The logic is consistent, and no security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard medical image preprocessing pipeline with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
