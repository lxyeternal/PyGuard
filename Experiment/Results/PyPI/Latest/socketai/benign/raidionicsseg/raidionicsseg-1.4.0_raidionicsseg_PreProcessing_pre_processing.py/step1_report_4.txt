{
  "purpose": "The code preprocesses medical imaging data (CT/MRI) for further analysis or inference, including resampling, normalization, cropping, and volume resizing.",
  "sources": "Data is read from NIfTI files via load_nifti_volume(), file paths provided as filename arguments, and some parameters from ConfigResources.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs include processed volumes and crop bounding boxes; no direct data leakage or insecure output is evident. No network or system command outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Input files are loaded -> data is resampled and normalized -> optional cropping and resizing -> data is returned for inference.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code blocks suggest previous or alternative implementations, but no unusual or suspicious code segments are actively executed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard medical image preprocessing steps: loading NIfTI files, resampling to desired spacing, background cropping based on modality, intensity normalization, and optional volume resizing. The functions utilize established libraries and follow typical data flow patterns. No network operations, system modifications, or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears to be designed for legitimate data preparation, with no indications of malicious intent. Use of deep copies and commented code does not introduce security concerns. All operations are consistent with common medical image preprocessing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical medical image preprocessing module with no malicious behavior. It processes imaging data securely and transparently for inference tasks. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
