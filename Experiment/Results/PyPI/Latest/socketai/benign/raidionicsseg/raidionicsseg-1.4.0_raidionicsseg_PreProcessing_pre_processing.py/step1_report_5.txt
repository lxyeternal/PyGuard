{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform pre-processing on medical imaging data (such as CT or MRI), including loading, resampling, cropping, normalization, and data augmentation for downstream inference tasks.",
  "sources": "File input via 'load_nifti_volume', reading image files with specific filenames, and accessing image header information.",
  "sinks": "Returns processed image data, possibly for use in machine learning inference pipelines; no apparent data leaks or external data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input files are loaded and processed through functions that normalize, resample, crop, and transform data; outputs are processed volumes. Data flows from file loading to in-memory numpy arrays with no external data transmission or sensitive data leaks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code contains commented-out sections that suggest incomplete or debugging code, but these do not perform malicious actions. No network operations, system commands, or external communications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code handles medical image pre-processing securely, relying on standard libraries and functions. It loads data, performs resampling, cropping, normalization, and optional transposition. There are no obfuscated language features, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic. Commented-out sections suggest previous or placeholder code; no malicious intent is evident. Functions are focused solely on data processing, with no external communications or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate medical image pre-processing module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. No malware, external data exfiltration, or security risks are detected based on this code snippet.",
