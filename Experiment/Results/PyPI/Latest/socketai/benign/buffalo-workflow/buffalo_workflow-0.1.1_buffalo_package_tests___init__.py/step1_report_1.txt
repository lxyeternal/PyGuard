  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a Python script or module, possibly involving data processing or utility functions. No explicit intent to harm is evident from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, local variables, and possibly external modules or libraries. No clear external data sources such as network inputs, files, or environment variables are directly indicated.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if present. However, based on the visible code, there are no obvious sinks where untrusted data leads to security-impacting actions.",
  "flows": "The data flow primarily involves internal processing within functions or classes, with no evidence of external data flow paths such as network transmission or database queries involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are observed. The code appears clean and standard, with no obfuscated or unnecessary dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code appears to be a typical Python implementation with standard libraries and functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoor mechanisms. The structure is straightforward, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are evident. The code does not utilize insecure practices like unsafe SQL, code injection, or insecure environment variable handling. The absence of obfuscation, unusual language features, or hidden code suggests a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign, well-structured, and free of anomalies or suspicious activity. The overall security risk is minimal.",
