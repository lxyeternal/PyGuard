  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve filesystem paths for templates based on the module's location, facilitating project setup.",
  "sources": "The functions get_template_dir() and get_template_path() derive paths from __file__ and os.path.join.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; filesystem paths are generated from static, trusted locations.",
  "flows": "The functions generate paths based solely on the module location without external input or data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines exception classes, utility functions, and two path-related functions. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The functions simply compute paths relative to the current file. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The code is typical for package initialization and utility setup, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package setup code with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low risk score (~0.05-0.1) reflecting minimal security concern due to filesystem path handling. The overall assessment confirms the code's safe and benign nature.",
