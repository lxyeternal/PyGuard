{
  "purpose": "Provides project management tools, utility functions, and exception handling for a project toolkit.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules, utility functions, and exception classes; functions like get_template_dir and get_template_path that access filesystem paths.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem access via os.path.join, Path, and returning directory/file paths; no untrusted data handling or network communication.",
  "flows": "Function get_template_dir reads directory info; get_template_path uses it to construct a path. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The code mainly handles path operations and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up project structure, imports modules, defines utility functions for filesystem paths, and exposes classes and functions. All operations involve local filesystem access and standard library functions without processing external untrusted input or executing dynamic code. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be standard setup code for a project toolkit.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup module for a project management toolkit with no malicious intent, security issues, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
