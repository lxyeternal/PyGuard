  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, inheriting from base Exception classes, with descriptive docstrings. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external data reads, nor any sink points for untrusted data. The code appears to be standard and straightforward for defining custom exceptions. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of custom exception class definitions with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
