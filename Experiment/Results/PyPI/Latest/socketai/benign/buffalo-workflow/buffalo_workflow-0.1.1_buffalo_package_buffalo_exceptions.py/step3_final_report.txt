  "purpose": "Definition of custom exception classes for error handling in the Buffalo application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception, no external data input or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; classes are static definitions without dynamic execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, inheriting from a base exception class and Python's built-in Exception. There are no input/output operations, external calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The classes serve purely as error categorization and do not contain any malicious or security-sensitive logic. The structure is standard, and the code is static and straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and clarity strongly suggest it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify the code as harmless and purely definitional. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's nature.",
