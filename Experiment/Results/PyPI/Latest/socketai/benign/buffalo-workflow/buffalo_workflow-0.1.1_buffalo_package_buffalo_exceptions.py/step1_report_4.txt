  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the Buffalo project.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading operations present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, especially no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists of straightforward class definitions with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no data inputs, external calls, or suspicious constructs. The classes serve as error types for the application, with appropriate inheritance structure and descriptive docstrings. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears clean, intended solely for error categorization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a structured way to handle exceptions in the application. There is no malicious intent, no data leakage, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
