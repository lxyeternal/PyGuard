  "review": "Let's review the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Analysis:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from a base exception class and Python's built-in Exception.\n   - All classes have descriptive docstrings.\n   - No input/output operations, data processing, external calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code appears benign and standard for defining custom exception classes.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The report's conclusion that the code is harmless and purely definitional is accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - Malware score: 0 in all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n   - Obfuscated score: 0, correct given the straightforward nature.\n   - Risk score: 0, justified as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious elements.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious code are made; the analysis is based solely on the visible code.\n\n5. **Any discrepancies or recommendations:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a benign set of custom exception class definitions.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores reflect this correctly.",
