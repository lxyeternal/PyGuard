  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Buffalo project.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read; all classes are static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes are only class definitions with no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance without dynamic code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception base class. There are no data input, output, or dynamic operations. No hardcoded secrets, external data handling, or malicious constructs are present. The structure is consistent and typical for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
