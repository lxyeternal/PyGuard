  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's `Exception` class.\n   - There are no input sources, no data processing, no external data reads, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded credentials.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with descriptive docstrings, serving purely as error categorization within the application.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. This is accurate given the code's simplicity.\n   - No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning; the analysis correctly identifies that the code is standard exception class definitions.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions with no malicious behavior, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and based on the actual code content, not assumptions.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and justified.\n\n**Summary of my own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, standard set of custom exception classes. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The overall assessment aligns with the provided reports. No changes are necessary to the scores or analysis.",
