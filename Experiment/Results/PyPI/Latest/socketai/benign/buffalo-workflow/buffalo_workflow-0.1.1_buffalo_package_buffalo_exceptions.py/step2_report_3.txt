  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic execution.\n   - The code is standard, well-structured, and typical for defining exception hierarchies.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The analysis in each report correctly states that the code is purely definitional with no malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0.\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code shows no malicious activity, no risk scores above 0.0 are justified.\n   - The reports correctly assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the static, safe nature of the code.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely definitional, with no malicious or risky behavior.",
