  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - No signs of hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns.\n   - All reports confirm the benign nature of the code, with a confidence level of 1.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is purely definitional and contains no malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The summaries and conclusions align with the code's nature.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, `obfuscated` scores of 0, and `securityRisk` scores of 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, indicating no security concern.\n   - Since the code is purely definitional with no external interactions or malicious patterns, this is justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on factual observations; no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n   - The reports are cautious and accurate.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are evident.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at 0.\n- The confidence level is high (1), as all evidence points to safe code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, safe implementation of custom exceptions with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
