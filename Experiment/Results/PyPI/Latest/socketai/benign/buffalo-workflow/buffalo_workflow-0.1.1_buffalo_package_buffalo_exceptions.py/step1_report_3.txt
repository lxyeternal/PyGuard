  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Buffalo project, categorizing different error types.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; all class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; no potential for data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions, serving as error types. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no side effects. The structure and syntax are standard and straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The code appears purely as a set of exception class definitions for error handling within a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides structured error types for the Buffalo project.",
