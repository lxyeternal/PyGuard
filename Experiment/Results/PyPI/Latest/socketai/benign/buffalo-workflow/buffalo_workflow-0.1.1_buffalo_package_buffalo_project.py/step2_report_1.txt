  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily a workflow and project management utility that loads and saves YAML configuration files.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as code injection, network activity, or obfuscation, are identified.\n- The code performs validation of YAML structure, manages internal data structures, and handles exceptions appropriately.\n- The scores assigned to malware and obfuscated are all zero, and security risk is low (around 0.1-0.2), which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code **does not** contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- No evidence of untrusted data influencing system commands or network operations.\n- The YAML files are used as configuration sources and sinks, which is typical.\n- The code relies on external utility functions (`load_yaml_file`, `save_yaml_file`) assumed safe.\n- No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flows are present.\n\n### Potential issues or points of concern:\n- The code trusts the YAML files' structure, but it performs validation to prevent malformed data.\n- External YAML files could be manipulated, but this is a normal risk in configuration management, not malicious.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk due to external YAML files, but not due to malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the code and reports, **the security risk is very low**, and there is **no evidence of malware or obfuscation**.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for external YAML file trust issues, but overall very low)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward, well-structured project workflow management utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score assigned by the reports is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- No changes needed to the scores.  \n- The code is safe from a supply chain security perspective based on the provided analysis.",
