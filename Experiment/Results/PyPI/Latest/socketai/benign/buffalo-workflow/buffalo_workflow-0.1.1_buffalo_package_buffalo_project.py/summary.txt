  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured project workflow management utility that loads and saves YAML configuration files with proper validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate."
