{
  "purpose": "Manage project workflows, load and save configuration data from YAML files, and track progress of individual works within a project.",
  "sources": "YAML configuration files loaded via load_yaml_file; data read from file paths; no untrusted input beyond file I/O.",
  "sinks": "No external network, system commands, or untrusted data sinks; data is confined to file operations and internal data structures.",
  "flows": "YAML files are read as sources; data is validated and used to instantiate or update Work objects; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. Validation of YAML structure is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file existence checks, YAML parsing, validation of required fields, and manages internal data structures for project and work states. It uses exception handling appropriately and relies on external utility functions presumed safe. No malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The validation logic ensures data integrity without executing untrusted code. The overall design is typical for configuration management tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured project workflow management utility that loads and saves YAML configuration files with proper validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
