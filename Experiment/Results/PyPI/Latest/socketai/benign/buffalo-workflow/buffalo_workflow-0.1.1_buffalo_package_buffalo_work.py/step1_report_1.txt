  "purpose": "Define a class for managing work units within a workflow, including status handling and representation.",
  "sources": "No external input or untrusted data sources are read directly in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition for managing work units, including constants for statuses, initialization, string representation, and status validation. It imports a custom exception, 'WorkStatusError', for invalid status assignment. No input data parsing, network communication, file I/O, or external data handling occurs. There are no hardcoded secrets, no code injection, and no malicious patterns. The class appears to be a utility component for workflow management with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and lacks any malicious or suspicious elements. It solely manages internal state without external communication or data leakage mechanisms.",
