{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for handling YAML data and file operations with safety measures",
  "sources": "Reads input from files via read_file and load_yaml_file functions, and accepts YAML strings in safe_load_yaml",
  "sinks": "Writes data to files via write_file and save_yaml_file functions, and returns data in safe_load_yaml",
  "flows": "Data flows from input files or strings into parsing functions, then potentially into dumping functions, and finally to file outputs",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The functions handle standard file and YAML operations with proper error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard utility functions for YAML handling and file I/O, with appropriate exception handling. It uses safe YAML loading and dumping, prevents directory traversal in write operations by creating necessary directories, and correctly raises custom exceptions. No indicators of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module focused on safe YAML processing and file operations, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
