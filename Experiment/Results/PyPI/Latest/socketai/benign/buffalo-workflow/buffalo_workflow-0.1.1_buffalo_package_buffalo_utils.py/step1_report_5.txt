  "purpose": "Utility module for safe YAML handling and file operations, providing functions for reading, writing, and parsing YAML content and files.",
  "sources": "YAML strings provided as arguments, file paths used in read_file, write_file, load_yaml_file, and save_yaml_file functions.",
  "sinks": "File read and write operations, which could potentially leak data if file contents are sensitive, but no malicious data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Input YAML strings or file contents are read or parsed in safe_load_yaml, load_yaml_file functions, and written out in dump_yaml, save_yaml_file functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard file and YAML operations with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and primarily handles YAML parsing and file I/O with proper exception handling. It does not include any network operations, external command executions, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All inputs are from file systems or function parameters, and there are no evident sources of untrusted data leading to unsafe sinks. The code is well-structured, uses safe YAML functions, and creates directories before writing files, reducing risk. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a safe utility module for YAML and file operations. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
