  "purpose": "Utility functions for safe YAML handling and file operations in Buffalo project.",
  "sources": "File reading functions (read_file, load_yaml_file), data input via function arguments (yaml_string, data, file_path).",
  "sinks": "Writing to files (write_file), raising exceptions, potentially exposing file paths or error messages.",
  "flows": "Input data from user or file → processing functions → file write/read operations, exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no dynamic execution, no external network calls, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard safe YAML parsing, data dumping, and file I/O operations. Exception handling is in place to manage errors without exposing sensitive info. No data leaks, no external communications, no backdoors, and no malicious code segments are present. Use of standard library functions and safe YAML methods indicates typical utility behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage within this module.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides straightforward utility functions for YAML and file management with proper error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malware in this code. The code appears safe and intended for benign utility purposes.",
