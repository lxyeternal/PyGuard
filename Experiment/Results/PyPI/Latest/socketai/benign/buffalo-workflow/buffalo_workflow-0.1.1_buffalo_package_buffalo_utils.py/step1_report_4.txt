{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for safe YAML handling and file operations, including reading and writing YAML files and handling errors appropriately.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function arguments (yaml_string, file_path, data), environment variables (indirectly through filesystem access), and file contents read from disk.",
  "sinks": "Sinks include reading files from disk, writing files to disk, and converting data to YAML strings.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments or files (sources) through functions that parse, convert, or save, reaching sinks such as file writes or data returns. For example, read_file reads from disk; safe_load_yaml parses YAML data; dump_yaml converts data to string; write_file writes to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hidden dynamic execution detected. The code uses standard Python libraries and straightforward error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O operations, YAML parsing, and serialization with appropriate error handling. It does not contain hardcoded credentials, network connections, or any suspicious logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoors. The functions are designed for safe handling of YAML data and files, with proper exception handling for common errors. No code injection, unsafe SQL, or other security issues are present. The only minor consideration is that 'write_file' creates directories as needed, which is standard and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module focused on safe YAML processing and file management. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as intended for secure data handling.",
