  "purpose": "Utility functions for safe YAML parsing/dumping and file operations, including reading and writing files with exception handling.",
  "sources": "Reading input from YAML strings and files, reading file contents, and directory creation during file writing.",
  "sinks": "Writing YAML data to files, creating directories, raising custom exceptions on errors.",
  "flows": "Input strings or file contents are processed through safe_load_yaml or dump_yaml, then written to files via write_file, which creates directories as needed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected. Directory creation in write_file is standard but could be misused if file paths are manipulated externally.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard safe YAML functions and proper exception handling, with no network calls or malicious logic. The directory creation step is typical for utility modules. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The exception handling prevents data leaks. The code is straightforward, readable, and safe. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The potential concern is directory creation, which is a common pattern and not inherently risky in trusted contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for YAML and file handling, with no malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk issues. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
