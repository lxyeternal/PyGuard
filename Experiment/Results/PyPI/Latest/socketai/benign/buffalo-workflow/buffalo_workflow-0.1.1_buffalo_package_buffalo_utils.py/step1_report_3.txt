{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for safe YAML handling and file operations, such as reading, writing, and parsing YAML files.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include YAML strings passed to safe_load_yaml, file contents read via read_file, and data structures passed to dump_yaml.",
  "sinks": "File writing in write_file and save_yaml_file, where data is written to disk; potential for overwriting or unintended file modification.",
  "flows": "YAML data is read from files or strings and returned or written back to files, with no external network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Error handling appears standard, with exceptions raised for file and YAML errors.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and practices for file handling and YAML serialization. No untrusted data is directly executed or sent over the network. The only input sources are files and strings provided to the functions, and the sinks are file writes. Error handling is conventional and does not introduce security issues. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious anomalies detected. The module appears to be a benign utility library with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module for YAML and file operations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely handles file I/O and YAML serialization/deserialization with proper error handling. No malicious signals or anomalies are present.",
