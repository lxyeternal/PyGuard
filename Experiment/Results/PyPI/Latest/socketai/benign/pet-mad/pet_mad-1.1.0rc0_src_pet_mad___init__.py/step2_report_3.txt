  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the code simply assigns a string (`\"1.1.0-rc\"`) to the `__version__` variable. There are no external inputs, no data flows, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns. The code is minimal and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that this is a benign, standard version assignment with no malicious or security implications. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- malware: 0\n- securityRisk: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, these scores are appropriate. No change is necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is just a straightforward version string assignment, there is no reason to assign a higher risk score. The code does not perform any malicious activity, data handling, or external communication.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's content. There is no indication of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they recognize the code as standard version declaration.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nThe scores are consistent and appropriate given the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is straightforward)\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no security issues)\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and no security risks.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
