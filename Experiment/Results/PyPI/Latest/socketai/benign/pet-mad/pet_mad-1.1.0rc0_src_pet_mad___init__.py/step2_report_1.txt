  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is simply assigning a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - The code is minimal, with no external data inputs, outputs, or complex logic.\n   - The version string includes a pre-release suffix (`-rc`), which is standard for release candidates and not suspicious.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - They correctly note that the presence of `-rc` is common and not inherently malicious.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0 and `malware` of 0, there's no justification for higher scores.\n   - The code is straightforward and does not pose any security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code only assigns a string to a variable; no malicious activity is indicated.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The overall assessment aligns with the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n- **Code Review:** The code is a simple version declaration, standard in Python packages.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No malware or security risks are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Adjusted Scores:** No changes needed; all scores are appropriate.\n\n**Personal Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code snippet is entirely benign, serving only to declare the package version. No security concerns or malicious intent are evident.",
