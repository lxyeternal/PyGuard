  "anomalies": "Presence of a pre-release version indicator ('-rc'), which is standard in versioning, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the '__version__' variable. This is typical in Python packages for versioning purposes. No malicious or unusual code behaviors are present. The only content is a version string indicating a release candidate. There are no input, output, or flow patterns to analyze further. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version assignment with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
