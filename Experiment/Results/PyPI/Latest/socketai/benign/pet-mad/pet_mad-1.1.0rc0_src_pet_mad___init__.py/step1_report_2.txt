  "purpose": "Define the version string of the package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the version string to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a pre-release version indicator ('-rc') in version string; no malicious activity detected but indicates development status.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string '1.1.0-rc' to the variable __version__. This is a standard practice for versioning in Python packages. The version string indicates a release candidate but does not involve any data input, output, or processing. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and solely specifies the package version. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
