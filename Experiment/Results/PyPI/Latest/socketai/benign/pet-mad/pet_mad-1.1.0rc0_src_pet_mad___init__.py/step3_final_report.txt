  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a string variable.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; simple static string assignment, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '1.1.0-rc' to the __version__ variable. It contains no external inputs, dynamic code, or complex logic. The '-rc' suffix indicates a release candidate, which is standard practice. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving solely as a version indicator.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a standard version declaration. There are no security risks, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The assigned scores (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
