  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string value to the __version__ variable, indicating the version of the package. There are no external inputs, outputs, or other logic present. The version string includes a pre-release suffix ('-rc'), which is common for release candidates and not inherently suspicious. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to declare the package version. There is no malicious behavior or security risk present.",
