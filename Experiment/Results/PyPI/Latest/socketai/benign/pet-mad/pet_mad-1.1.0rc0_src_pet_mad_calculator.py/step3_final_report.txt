  "purpose": "Defines an ASE calculator class for PET-MAD, handling model loading from URL or checkpoint, version management, and calculation routines.",
  "sources": "Model URL construction, checkpoint path input, external functions load_model and export",
  "sinks": "Loading external model files; potential risk if source is compromised, but no code execution or data exfiltration occurs within this code",
  "flows": "Source: URL or checkpoint path -> load_model -> export -> model assignment -> calculations via _calculator",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a scientific calculator class that loads a model from a controlled URL or local checkpoint, performs calculations, and manages versioning and deprecation warnings. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations beyond model download, or contain obfuscated segments. External dependencies like load_model and export are external points of trust but are not inherently malicious. The logging of paths and URLs is standard practice. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident within this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation for loading and using a machine learning model in scientific computations. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. External model files could pose risks if compromised, but this is outside the scope of the code itself. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
