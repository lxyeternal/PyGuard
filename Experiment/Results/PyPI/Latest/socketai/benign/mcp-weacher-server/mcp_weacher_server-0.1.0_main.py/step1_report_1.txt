{
  "purpose": "The code implements a weather query service that fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and formats it for display, with an MCP server interface for interaction.",
  "sources": "API_KEY (set via command line argument), user input for city names in query_weather function",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to OpenWeather API, data returned from API, formatted weather data output",
  "flows": "API_KEY from command line -> fetch_weather() -> httpx request -> response -> format_weather() -> output string",
  "anomalies": "API_KEY is set at runtime via command-line argument; no hardcoded credentials or secrets in code. No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. The code uses standard libraries and appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes an MCP server and defines functions to fetch and format weather data from an external API. API_KEY is set dynamically via command-line, avoiding hardcoded secrets. HTTP requests are made securely with timeouts. No data leaks, no code injection, no backdoors, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The code functions as a weather data retrieval service with proper error handling. No malicious code or malware signals identified. The overall structure and functions are straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate weather query service with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It handles API keys securely at runtime and communicates with external APIs in a safe manner. No security risks or malicious behaviors detected.",
