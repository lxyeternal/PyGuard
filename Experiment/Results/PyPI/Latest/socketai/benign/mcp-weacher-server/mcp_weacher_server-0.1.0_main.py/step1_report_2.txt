{
  "purpose": "The script is a weather information server that fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API based on user input and serves it via an MCP interface.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from command-line argument '--api_key' and the 'city' parameter in the 'query_weather' function.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include the 'city' parameter passed to 'fetch_weather' which is used in API requests, and the API key supplied via command line, which could influence external API requests or configuration.",
  "flows": "Input from command line '--api_key' sets the global API_KEY used in API requests; 'city' parameter in 'query_weather' flows into 'fetch_weather' and then into the API request; the response data from OpenWeather API flows into 'format_weather' for formatting and output.",
  "anomalies": "The 'API_KEY' is set dynamically via command-line argument without validation; no hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The use of async API requests is standard. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code are evident. The code relies on external 'mcp' library for communication, but this is not suspicious in context.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an MCP server and exposes a tool 'query_weather' that fetches weather data from OpenWeather API. It handles API key input securely via command-line argument, and performs standard HTTP requests with proper error handling. No suspicious data flows, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behavior are observed. The response data is properly formatted and returned. The overall structure is straightforward and does not contain any hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign weather API wrapper and server implementation with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It securely handles API keys provided at runtime and performs standard API requests and data formatting. No malware, backdoors, or security risks are identified.",
