  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It functions as a standard weather query service with appropriate runtime API key handling. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the benign analysis."
