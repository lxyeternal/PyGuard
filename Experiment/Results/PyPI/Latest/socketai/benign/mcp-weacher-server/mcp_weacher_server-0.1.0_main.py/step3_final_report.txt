{
  "purpose": "Fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap API for a specified city and serves it via an MCP server interface.",
  "sources": "User input for city name, API key provided at runtime, external API request to OpenWeatherMap.",
  "sinks": "API request to external server, response data returned to caller, no data leaks or untrusted data execution.",
  "flows": "User provides city name -> fetch_weather() constructs API request -> response received -> format_weather() processes data -> query_weather() returns formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward weather data fetcher that uses standard libraries and practices. The API key is supplied at runtime, reducing risk of leakage. External API calls are handled with proper error handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The data flow is typical, with no signs of data exfiltration or malicious payloads. The global variable for API_KEY is a common pattern and does not introduce security issues. Overall, the code is benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It functions as a standard weather query service with appropriate runtime API key handling. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the benign analysis.",
