{
  "purpose": "This code implements a weather information server that fetches data from the OpenWeather API based on user input and provides formatted weather details.",
  "sources": "API_KEY input from command-line arguments; user input for city name via function parameter.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to OpenWeather API, output formatting and return; potential data leaks if API_KEY or user data is mishandled.",
  "flows": "API_KEY from command-line -> fetch_weather() -> HTTP request to OpenWeather API -> response -> format_weather() -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "API_KEY is set via command-line argument, which is standard; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious URL or data handling; no obfuscated code, no suspicious network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a weather server, fetches data from an external API using a user-provided API key, and formats the data for display. The API key is passed securely at runtime. HTTP requests are properly handled with error catching. No hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior detected. The overall structure is standard for such an application, and no malicious or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward weather API client with server interface, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It securely handles user input and external API requests without suspicious behavior.",
