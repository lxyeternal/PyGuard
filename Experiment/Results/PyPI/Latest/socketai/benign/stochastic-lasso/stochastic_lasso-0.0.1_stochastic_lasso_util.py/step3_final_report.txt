  "purpose": "Standardize predictor variables by mean-centering and scaling to unit variance, and mean-center response variable y.",
  "sources": "X: array of predictors, y: response vector",
  "sinks": "None; data is processed in-memory without external data sinks or network calls",
  "flows": "X -> mean-centering (X - X.mean()), then scaled by dividing by sqrt of sum of squared deviations; y -> mean-centered (y - y.mean())",
  "anomalies": "Uses sum of squared deviations for scaling instead of conventional standard deviation; no handling for zero variance predictors",
  "analysis": "The code performs mean-centering of X and y, then scales X by dividing each predictor by the Euclidean norm of its deviations, which is proportional to the standard deviation but not exactly the same. The response y is only mean-centered. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The scaling method is unconventional but not malicious; it may lead to slightly different normalization results compared to standard deviation-based scaling. No security risks or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data normalization function with a non-standard scaling method. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main issue is the unconventional calculation of the scale, which could be improved for correctness but does not pose security concerns.",
