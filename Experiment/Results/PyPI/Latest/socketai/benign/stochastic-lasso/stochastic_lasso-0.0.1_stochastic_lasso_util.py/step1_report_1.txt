{
  "purpose": "The function standardizes predictor variables and response for statistical analysis or machine learning preprocessing.",
  "sources": "Reads input arrays X and y, specifically X.mean() and y.mean() for calculating means, and array operations on X and y.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks leading to data leakage or malicious effects; the code performs standardization calculations only.",
  "flows": "Inputs (X, y) are used to compute means and scaled versions; no untrusted data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Mathematical operations are standard for data preprocessing; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. The calculation of standard deviation uses a sum of squares, which is acceptable. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standardization function, computing mean-centered X and y. It calculates mean_x as X minus its mean, then standardizes X by dividing by the square root of the sum of squared deviations (which acts as a standard deviation). y is mean-centered but not scaled otherwise. The operations are typical for data normalization. No external data, network calls, or malicious behaviors detected. No signs of data leakage, secret keys, or backdoors. The code appears safe and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data normalization function with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical statistical preprocessing without suspicious features.",
