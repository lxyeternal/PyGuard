{
  "purpose": "This code performs data standardization by mean-centering and scaling predictors and response variables for statistical analysis or machine learning preprocessing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays 'X' and 'y' for calculations; uses array operations and methods like 'mean()' and arithmetic on 'X' and 'y'.",
  "sinks": "Returns scaled predictor and response arrays; no data output or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input data 'X' and 'y' are read; mean calculations are performed; data is scaled and returned; no external data flow outside function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected; operations are standard statistical computations.",
  "analysis": "The function computes mean-centering of X and y, then scales X by dividing by the standard deviation derived from the squared differences. The calculation appears to correctly implement standardization, returning scaled data and predictor standard deviations. No external or malicious data access, no suspicious code logic, and no potentially harmful operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward statistical standardization with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a normal data preprocessing function.",
