{
  "purpose": "The function performs standardization on input features and response variable, centering and scaling them for statistical or machine learning purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the input arrays X and y, specifically their mean values and element-wise operations on X and y.",
  "sinks": "Returns scaled versions of X and y; no data is sent elsewhere or to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data (X and y) are processed internally, with operations computing means and standard deviations, then returned as scaled data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standardization function that computes the mean of X, subtracts it to center the data, and scales X by its standard deviation computed across each predictor. Similarly, y is mean-centered. All operations are straightforward mathematical transformations with no external data or system interactions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to serve a typical data preprocessing purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data normalization for machine learning, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
