{
  "purpose": "To standardize predictor variables and response variable by mean-centering and scaling to unit variance.",
  "sources": "Reads input arrays X and y, specifically accessing their mean and performing arithmetic operations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious output; computations are purely mathematical.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are read to compute means and standard deviations, then used to produce scaled arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual or obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The function calculates the mean of X, then normalizes X by subtracting this mean and dividing by the standard deviation derived from the sum of squared deviations. It similarly centers y by subtracting its mean. The calculations are straightforward statistical transformations. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The code relies solely on NumPy array operations for standardization.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical data preprocessing for machine learning without any malicious intent or security concerns. It is a standard implementation for data normalization.",
