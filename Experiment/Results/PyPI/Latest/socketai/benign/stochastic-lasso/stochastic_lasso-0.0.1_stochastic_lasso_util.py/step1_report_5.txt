{
  "purpose": "The code performs data standardization by mean-centering and scaling predictor variables and response variables for statistical or machine learning preprocessing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the variables X and y provided as function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that lead untrusted data to any external or sensitive output, nor does the code send data over a network or write to files.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the input parameters X and y through mean and standard deviation calculations within the function, resulting in scaled_X and scaled_y outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward numerical operations with no unusual language features, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The function calculates the mean of X and subtracts it to center the data, then scales by the square root of the sum of squared deviations, effectively standardizing the predictor variables. The response y is mean-centered but not scaled. All operations are standard statistical preprocessing. No network activity, file I/O, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is clear, standard, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data standardization for predictors and responses with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs basic mathematical operations without any malicious side effects.",
