{
  "purpose": "Provides Python wrapper functions for glmnet's linear and logistic regression models, including elastic net, LASSO, Ridge, and adaptive LASSO, with cross-validation for parameter tuning.",
  "sources": "Imports 'glmnet' library, which loads functions from an external Fortran-based package; input data from parameters X, y, sample_weight, adaptive_weights.",
  "sinks": "Fitted model objects and coefficients returned by functions; no data is sent elsewhere, no network or external data leakage apparent.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, y, weights) into glmnet model fit functions; model objects stored in local variables; coefficients extracted and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of external 'glmnet' library is standard. No code obfuscation, hidden dynamic execution, or misleading variables detected.",
  "analysis": "The code wraps glmnet functions for various regularized regression models. It uses common patterns for cross-validation, parameter tuning, and model fitting. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious logic observed. The library glmnet is a known external package for statistical modeling, not a malicious component. The functions accept parameters, perform regression fitting, and return coefficients without performing any suspicious operations. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate wrapper around glmnet for regularized regression modeling, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
