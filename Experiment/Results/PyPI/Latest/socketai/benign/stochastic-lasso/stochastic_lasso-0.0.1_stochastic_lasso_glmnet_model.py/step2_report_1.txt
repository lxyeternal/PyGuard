  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a legitimate wrapper around glmnet, with no malicious activity or suspicious code. The confidence is high (0.9). No obfuscation or malware is detected, and security risk is zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code matches the description; it simply wraps glmnet functions for various models. No signs of malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious logic.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, security risk is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with slightly higher security risk (0.1). No obfuscation or malware, just standard wrapping of glmnet models.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward. The minor security risk could be due to the use of external libraries or general code practices, but nothing malicious.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score remains 0; security risk at 0.1 seems reasonable given the external dependency, but no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard wrapper functions with no suspicious patterns. Security risk is slightly higher at 0.2, but no malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings; no malicious indicators.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware remains 0; security risk at 0.2 is acceptable considering external library usage.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—standard wrapper, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, malware score 0, security risk 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's behavior.\n\n- **Score justification:** No change needed; scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—legitimate wrapper, no malicious activity, security risk 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code and other reports.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is a straightforward wrapper around the glmnet library, performing standard statistical modeling tasks. No suspicious logic, obfuscation, or malicious code is present.\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any network activity, system modifications, or malicious operations.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Given the external dependency on glmnet (a known open-source statistical library), the minor security risk scores (ranging from 0.1 to 0.2) are acceptable. No evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities is present.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the external dependency and the nature of the code, a low risk score (around 0.1) is justified, but not higher.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| 0               | 0                  | 0.1–0.2    |\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports and code analysis)\n\nThe code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious intent.",
