{
  "purpose": "The code provides wrappers for the glmnet library to perform various regularization techniques (Lasso, Elastic Net, Ridge, Adaptive Lasso) for linear and logistic regression models, with cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data arrays X and y, as well as optional parameters such as sample_weight, adaptive_weights, and random_state.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily calls external glmnet library functions for model fitting and coefficient extraction; no data is written or sent over networks.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into glmnet model fitting functions; model results (coefficients) are returned after computation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, such as dynamic execution, obfuscated patterns, or hidden backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around the glmnet library, facilitating model training for different regularization methods with cross-validation. It uses numpy for array operations and constructs multiple glmnet models based on input parameters. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious code, or unusual behavior. The functions rely on standard library calls and do not perform any network operations, system modifications, or sensitive data handling beyond standard modeling procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured wrapper for glmnet modeling techniques with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates as a standard machine learning utility, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
