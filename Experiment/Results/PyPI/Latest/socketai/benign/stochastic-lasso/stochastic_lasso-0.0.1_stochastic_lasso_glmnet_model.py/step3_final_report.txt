{
  "purpose": "A Python wrapper for the glmnet library, implementing linear and logistic regression models with cross-validation.",
  "sources": "Imports glmnet and numpy; reads input data X, y, and optional parameters.",
  "sinks": "Returns model coefficients; no data leaks, network activity, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into glmnet model fitting functions, resulting in coefficient outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around the glmnet library, providing functions for adaptive Lasso, Elastic Net, LASSO, and Ridge regressions with cross-validation. It uses external, well-known libraries without any network activity, system modifications, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code adheres to standard practices and is transparent in its operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign wrapper for glmnet, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal external dependency considerations. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
