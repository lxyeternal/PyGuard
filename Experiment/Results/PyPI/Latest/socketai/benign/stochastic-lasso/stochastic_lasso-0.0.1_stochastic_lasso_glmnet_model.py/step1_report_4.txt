{
  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper for glmnet library functions to perform various regularized regression models such as Adaptive Lasso, Elastic Net, LASSO, and Ridge, primarily for linear and logistic regression, with cross-validation to select optimal hyperparameters.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'glmnet' and 'numpy'; function parameters (X, y, sample_weight, adaptive_weights); data used in fit() methods.",
  "sinks": "Return of model coefficients; no direct data output or data leakage points; no system or network calls observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, y) flows into model fitting functions, which compute models and output coefficients; no external data flow or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; the code solely wraps glmnet functions and performs standard regularized regression modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known open-source library (glmnet) for statistical modeling, and provides functions to perform Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net regressions with cross-validation. Each function instantiates models from glmnet, fits them to the input data, and returns the model coefficients. No suspicious data handling, network activity, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be straightforward, designed for statistical modeling tasks without any hidden or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of statistical modeling wrappers around the glmnet library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured modeling utility without security risks.",
