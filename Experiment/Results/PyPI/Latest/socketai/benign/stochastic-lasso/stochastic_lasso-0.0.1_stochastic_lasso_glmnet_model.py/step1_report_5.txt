{
  "purpose": "This code provides wrapper functions for regularized regression models (Adaptive Lasso, Elastic Net, LASSO, Ridge) using the glmnet library, supporting both linear and logistic models for statistical analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from parameters X and y provided to each function. It also uses optional parameters like sample_weight and adaptive_weights for model fitting.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external locations, transmit data over the network, or include any system commands. It only returns model coefficients.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (X, y, sample_weight, adaptive_weights) into model fitting functions, which produce trained models and coefficients as output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling is present. Usage of external library glmnet appears legitimate. No unusual or suspicious code constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple wrapper functions for glmnet models, supporting both logistic and linear regression with cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning. The functions use standard patterns: initialize models, fit with provided data and weights, and return coefficients. There are no signs of data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious behavior. External library glmnet is used as intended. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or hidden behaviors are observed. All operations are typical for a statistical modeling package.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured wrapper around the glmnet library for regularized regression models, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
