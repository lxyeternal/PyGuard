{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Stochastic LASSO model with optional logistic regression for feature selection, including bootstrapping and predictor sampling techniques.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays X and y; uses np.random for random number generation; reads sample_weight if provided.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that send untrusted data to external systems, network, or disk. No data leakage or privacy violations detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input X, y through standardization and bootstrap sampling, with coefficients estimated and p-values computed based on bootstrap results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The predictor sampling algorithm is somewhat complex but aligns with correlation-based sampling. No malicious code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical bootstrap sampling with predictor selection based on correlation, coefficient estimation via elastic net modeling, and p-value calculations using t-tests. It uses standard libraries and appears to implement a feature selection algorithm. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are present. Use of parallel processing with ProcessPoolExecutor is standard. No signs of malware such as hidden backdoors, data theft, or system compromise are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a stochastic feature selection method with statistical testing. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or malware. The code is complex but standard for statistical modeling and feature selection tasks.",
