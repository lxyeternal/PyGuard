{
  "purpose": "Implements a stochastic LASSO feature selection method with optional logistic regression, parallel processing, and correlation-based predictor sampling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays, sample weights, and internal random number generators.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network communication, or file modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows within local functions; no external sinks or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Suppression of FutureWarning; no obfuscation or suspicious external dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical procedures including bootstrap sampling, correlation-based predictor sampling, coefficient estimation via glmnet, and p-value computation. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are present. The suppression of warnings is benign but could mask deprecation notices. External modules are assumed safe. Random seed handling appears standard for reproducibility. The implementation aligns with common practices in statistical modeling and feature selection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a stochastic LASSO feature selection pipeline with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The security risk is minimal, and the code does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
