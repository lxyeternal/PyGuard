  "purpose": "This code implements a stochastic LASSO feature selection algorithm with optional logistic regression, parallel processing, and custom predictor sampling based on correlation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data matrices X and y, random seed via random_state, and sample weights. Uses external modules util and glmnet_model for standardization and elastic net regression.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data for harmful effects. No network operations, file writes, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the fit method, which invokes bootstrap sampling, coefficient estimation, and p-value computation. Data is processed within local functions with no external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code. Usage of warnings suppression is standard but could be scrutinized if unrelated to debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a statistical feature selection process, including bootstrap sampling, correlation-based predictor sampling, and p-value calculations. The implementation relies on standard libraries and external modules for regression and standardization. No network communication, system modifications, or suspicious code structures are evident. The process appears to be a typical statistical modeling pipeline with parallelization options. There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code injection. Use of random number generators is standard for bootstrap sampling. The suppression of FutureWarning is benign but should be documented to avoid masking genuine issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a stochastic feature selection algorithm with no malicious intent. It performs statistical calculations, sampling, and regression modeling in a straightforward manner. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
