  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, standard statistical pipeline, parallel processing, no external communication.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the conclusion that there's no malicious activity.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, justified by benign code structure.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Issue:** The suppression of `FutureWarning` is benign but could hide deprecation warnings, which might be relevant for future maintenance.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing proper use of libraries, no external data leaks, responsible parallelization.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Issue:** No issues; the analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on statistical methods, no external communication, suppression of warnings noted.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Issue:** The suppression of `FutureWarning` could mask important deprecation notices but is not malicious.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard statistical feature selection with parallel processing, no external system interactions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Issue:** No issues; the code is typical for statistical modeling.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, responsible use of parallel processing, no external data leaks, standard practices.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports agree there's no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious external activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low; the only minor concern is the suppression of `FutureWarning`, which could hide deprecation warnings but does not pose a security threat.\n- **Code Behavior:** Implements a statistical feature selection pipeline with standard libraries, parallelization, and no external network or file system interactions.\n\n### **Conclusion & Recommendations:**\n\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- The **obfuscated score** should remain at **0**.\n- The **security risk score** can be justified at **0.2** due to the suppression of warnings, but this is a benign practice rather than a security concern.\n\n### **Final Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the overall consensus that the code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a statistical feature selection method with no malicious intent.",
