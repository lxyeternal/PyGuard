  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `__version__ = '0.0.1'`.\n- The analysis in each report correctly states that this is a standard version assignment in Python.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious constructs mentioned.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- Obfuscation is also correctly identified as 0, since the code is straightforward.\n\n**Confirmations and validations:**\n- The code is a simple string assignment, common in Python packages.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The confidence is 1 in all reports, which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n- The securityRisk score is 0, which is correct.\n- The malware score is 0, matching the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated is 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n**Any issues or inconsistencies?**\n- No. All assessments are accurate.\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the risks.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is harmless, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The reports are thorough and correct.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Security risk score: 0\n\n**Final note:**\n- Since the code is a minimal, standard version declaration, there is no reason to assign any higher risk scores.\n- The assessments are accurate, and no further action is necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet. The scoring is appropriate, and no adjustments are needed.",
