  "anomalies": "None; code is a straightforward version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard version declaration in Python, with no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. It does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, standard version string assignment with no malicious or security concerns. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
