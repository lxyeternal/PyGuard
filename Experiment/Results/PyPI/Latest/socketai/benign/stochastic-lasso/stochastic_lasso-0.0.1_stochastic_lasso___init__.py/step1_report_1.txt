  "anomalies": "No anomalies; minimal code with no complex behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a string to the __version__ variable, which is a common practice in Python packages to specify versioning. There are no inputs, no outputs, no data processing, and no suspicious constructs. This is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment with no malicious behavior or security issues. It does not pose any threat and is typical in Python package modules.",
