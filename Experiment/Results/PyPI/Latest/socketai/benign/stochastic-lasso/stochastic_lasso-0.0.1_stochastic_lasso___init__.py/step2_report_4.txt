  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. The original code is:\n\n   ```python\n   __version__ = '0.0.1'\n   ```\n\n   This is a standard practice in Python packages, with no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their description. They correctly identify that the code is minimal, benign, and typical for version declaration. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n   - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n   - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n   - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n\n   These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is a straightforward version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior, a risk score above 0.5 isn't justified. The current score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature. No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid assumptions and correctly interpret the code as a standard version declaration. No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct; no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct; code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct; no security risk)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n**My personal estimate** aligns with the reports:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis code fragment is entirely benign and typical in open-source Python packages.",
