{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package named 'stochastic_lasso', intended to configure package installation and metadata.",
  "sources": "Read from the setuptools library for setup and find_packages functions, as well as the package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network communication, file writing, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to package metadata and dependency specifications used during installation; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious dependencies, or obfuscated code are detected. The dependencies 'glmnet' and 'tqdm' are standard and well-known.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It defines package name, version, description, author info, URL, dependencies, and classifiers. No code execution or input handling occurs beyond static configuration. The dependencies and metadata appear benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious behavior or malicious code. The dependencies are standard and do not indicate malicious activity.",
