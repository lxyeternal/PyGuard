{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'stochastic_lasso' Python package, defining metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "User-provided code, primarily reading package metadata and specifying dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or code execution; standard setup procedures.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; configuration data flows from the script to the setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' to configure package installation, specifying package details such as name, version, author info, URL, dependencies, and classifiers. No external input, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present. All dependencies are listed explicitly, and the code adheres to standard packaging practices. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate package installation, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs typical package setup tasks without any anomalies.",
