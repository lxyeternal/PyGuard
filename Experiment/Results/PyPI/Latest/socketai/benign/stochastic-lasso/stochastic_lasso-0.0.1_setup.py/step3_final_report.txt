  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for the 'stochastic_lasso' Python package.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields, dependencies ('glmnet', 'tqdm'), package discovery via find_packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no network calls, no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools, defining package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns. Dependencies are standard packages. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is negligible (~0.0 to 0.1). The slight variation in risk score (0.1) in one report is conservative but acceptable. Overall, the code poses no security threat and is a standard package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is safe, benign, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. All reports are accurate; minor overestimation of risk in one case is acceptable. No changes are necessary.",
