  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for packaging the 'stochastic_lasso' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads project metadata (name, version, description, author, email, URL, dependencies, packages, keywords, Python version requirement, classifiers).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or code execution.",
  "flows": "Uses metadata to configure package setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Dependencies are standard for a Python package. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script utilizing setuptools for packaging. It specifies project metadata, dependencies ('glmnet', 'tqdm'), and package discovery. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or suspicious logic is present. All elements are typical for a Python package setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
