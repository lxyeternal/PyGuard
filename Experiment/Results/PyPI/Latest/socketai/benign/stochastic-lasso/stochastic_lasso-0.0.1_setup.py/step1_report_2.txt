  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'stochastic_lasso', including its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, author information, URL, required dependencies, and package inclusion directives.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed or where untrusted data could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The setup metadata flows from the defined variables and arguments into the packaging system to build/install the package.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or unusual code patterns. Dependencies are standard, and no dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script used for packaging Python modules. It specifies package details, dependencies, and compatibility. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. No suspicious or malicious code is included, and it relies on standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal setup configuration file for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
