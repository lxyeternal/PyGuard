{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the create_custom_ansatz function in the easy_vqe module to verify correct behavior and error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads static test data, imports modules, and calls create_custom_ansatz with specific arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs that could lead to security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - No flow from untrusted source to sink; the code performs predefined tests and assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code uses standard testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports well-known testing libraries and a quantum circuit library, then defines multiple test functions that check various scenarios of the target function. All inputs are hardcoded test data, and assertions verify expected behavior. Error handling tests are included, and no dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears to be a straightforward, conventional test suite without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test script for a quantum circuit ansatz creation function, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
