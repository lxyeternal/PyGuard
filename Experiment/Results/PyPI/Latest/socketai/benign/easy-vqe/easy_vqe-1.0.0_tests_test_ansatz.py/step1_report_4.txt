{
  "purpose": "Unit testing the create_custom_ansatz function for correctness, error handling, and structure validation.",
  "sources": "Import statements (pytest, qiskit, easy_vqe); test function inputs and assertions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input data (test parameters) flow through create_custom_ansatz, with assertions verifying output integrity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of well-structured pytest unit tests verifying the functionality and error handling of the create_custom_ansatz function. It uses standard testing patterns, with no dynamic code execution, external data sources, or suspicious patterns. The code only imports and uses open-source libraries (pytest, qiskit, easy_vqe), and all assertions check for expected behaviors and exceptions. No code indicates malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard set of unit tests for a quantum circuit ansatz creation function, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. It is legitimate test code with low security risk.",
