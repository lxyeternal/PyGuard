{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for the 'create_custom_ansatz' function from the 'easy_vqe' module, verifying its behavior with different inputs and error conditions.",
  "sources": "The code reads static test data (e.g., 'structure', 'block'), input parameters, and calls to 'create_custom_ansatz'.",
  "sinks": "Assertions that verify output properties; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input test data flows into 'create_custom_ansatz'; output and assertions check the results, but there are no external data flows or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected. The test code appears standard and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing libraries and the target function, then defines multiple test cases covering standard operation and error handling scenarios. It uses static, controlled data and does not process external user input or untrusted sources. All assertions are standard testing practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a quantum circuit ansatz creation function. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It is a safe testing script, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
