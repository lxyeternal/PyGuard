{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the create_custom_ansatz function from the easy_vqe module, verifying correct behavior and error handling.",
  "sources": "Static test data within the test functions, including ansatz_structure and parameters, with no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external inputs or outputs beyond test assertions.",
  "flows": "Input data (test structures) flow through create_custom_ansatz, with assertions verifying the outputs; no malicious or suspicious data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; the code is straightforward and standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests using static, controlled inputs to verify the behavior of create_custom_ansatz. It does not include any dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling. The tests check for expected properties and error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. All signals point to benign, standard testing code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test suite with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
