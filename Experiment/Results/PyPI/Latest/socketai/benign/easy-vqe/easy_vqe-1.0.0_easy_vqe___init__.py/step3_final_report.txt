{
  "purpose": "Provides a simple interface for running Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) simulations using Qiskit, focusing on ease of use for defining Hamiltonians and ansatz structures.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from the local '.vqe_core' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external data flows present",
  "flows": "Imports functions from '.vqe_core' without dynamic execution or data manipulation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward import and setup",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static module that imports functions, sets a version, and configures logging with NullHandler. It contains no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The imported functions are assumed to be trusted, and the code serves as an interface layer. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The security and malware scores are appropriately set to zero, and the code's simplicity supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward Python package interface with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are consistent with its static and transparent nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
