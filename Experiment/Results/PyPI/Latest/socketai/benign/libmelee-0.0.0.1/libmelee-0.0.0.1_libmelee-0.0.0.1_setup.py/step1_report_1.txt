  "purpose": "Define and configure the package metadata for 'libmelee' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from the package setup parameters such as name, version, author, author_email, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present as the code does not process untrusted input or data streams.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists since the setup parameters are hardcoded string literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or hidden behaviors are observed. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard setup script for a Python package. It uses setuptools to specify package metadata, with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious behavior. All parameters are hardcoded and simple, serving only as package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
