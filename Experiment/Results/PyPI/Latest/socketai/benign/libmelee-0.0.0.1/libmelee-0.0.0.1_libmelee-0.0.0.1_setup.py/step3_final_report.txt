  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input is processed.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static configuration parameters only.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional version number '0.0.0.1' and empty author fields, but these are placeholders, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard setup script with no dynamic or external data handling. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The version number and empty author fields are benign placeholders. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious features justify these scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
