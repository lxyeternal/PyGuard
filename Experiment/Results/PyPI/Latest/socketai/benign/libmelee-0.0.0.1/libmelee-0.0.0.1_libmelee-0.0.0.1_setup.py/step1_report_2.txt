  "purpose": "Define and configure the package metadata for distribution of the 'libmelee' Python package.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function call and its parameters within the code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks, but potential misuse if used maliciously to misrepresent package intent.",
  "flows": "The package metadata parameters flow from the source code into the setup process, with no external data input or output.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields; the version number '0.0.0.1' is unusual but not malicious; description is generic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools, with typical metadata fields. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, no external data handling, no obfuscated or malicious code present. The empty author fields are unusual but not inherently malicious. Overall, the script is a straightforward package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a placeholder or template with minimal risk.",
