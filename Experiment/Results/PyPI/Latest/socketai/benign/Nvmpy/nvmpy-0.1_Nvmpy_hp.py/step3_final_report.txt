  "purpose": "A class `HP` storing a list of code snippets as empty strings, with a method to retrieve snippets by index.",
  "sources": "The static list `codes` containing empty multi-line strings.",
  "sinks": "The `text()` method returning snippets; no external data or untrusted input processed.",
  "flows": "Index parameter passed to `text()` leading to retrieval from `codes` list.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of empty strings in `codes`, likely placeholders; no malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The class is a benign container for code snippets with safe access logic. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The empty strings are placeholders, not malicious payloads. Error handling in `text()` is appropriate. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Slightly elevated security risk score (0.1) in some reports accounts for potential future misuse if snippets are used dynamically, but as-is, the code is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign scaffold with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in its current form. The minor risk score reflects hypothetical future risks if snippets are dynamically executed, but presently, the code is safe.",
