{
  "purpose": "The code imports three classes (HP, NN, Game) from local modules within the package, likely to use their functionalities in the larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading from local modules (.hp, .nn, .game). No external input or data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potentially dangerous output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis can be conducted as there are only import statements without any data processing or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, which is typical for modular Python projects. No external data input, network activity, or suspicious behavior is evident. Since only imports are shown, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be a standard setup for a Python package or module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a normal modular Python codebase.",
