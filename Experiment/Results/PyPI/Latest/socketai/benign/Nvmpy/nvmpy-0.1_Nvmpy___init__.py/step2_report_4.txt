  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their accuracy and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward import statements from local modules.\n- No data processing, network activity, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Report 1-4:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is just import statements; no issues or malicious activity are present.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No logical errors or flaws; the reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** All assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- **Justification for scores:** Given the code snippet, these scores are justified.\n- **Potential improvements:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose and analysis:** Similar to others, no suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower at 0.9, which is acceptable but could be 1 given the simplicity.\n- **Scores:** All zeroes for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are correct.\n- **Claim about potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made; the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security risks identified.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- Since the code is purely import statements, there is no reason to assign any higher scores.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is correct.",
