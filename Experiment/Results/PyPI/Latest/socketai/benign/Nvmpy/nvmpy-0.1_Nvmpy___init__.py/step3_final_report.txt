  "purpose": "Simple import statements from local modules (.hp, .nn, .game), likely part of a larger project.",

  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static import statements with no dynamic execution or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements importing classes from local modules. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python projects. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified given the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1), as the code is simple and well-understood.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of standard import statements. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
