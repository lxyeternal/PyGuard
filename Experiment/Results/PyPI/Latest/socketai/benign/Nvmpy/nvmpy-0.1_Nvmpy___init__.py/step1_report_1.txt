  "sinks": "No sinks or data output functions present in the provided code",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks within this snippet; imports do not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected; standard import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes from relative modules. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The imports are straightforward, and no malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. This code appears to be a normal part of a package setup or module import process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard module imports without any signs of malicious intent or security issues. No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
