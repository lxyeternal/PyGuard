  "purpose": "Importing classes HP, NN, and Game from local modules for use in the larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.hp, .nn, .game).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external data flow detected.",
  "flows": "Data flow involves usage of imported classes, but no direct data flow or untrusted data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, indicating the inclusion of classes without any embedded logic or data handling. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident, and the code appears to be straightforward module imports typical in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger codebase where these classes are used, but on its own, it is benign.",
