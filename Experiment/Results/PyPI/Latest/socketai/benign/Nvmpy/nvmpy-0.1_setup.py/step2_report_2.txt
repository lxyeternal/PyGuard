  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**1. Report 1**  \n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the code as a setup configuration for Nvmpy using setuptools.  \n- **Sources:** Reading 'README.md' and importing setup, find_packages.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks; reading a local file is standard.  \n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard practice.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues here.\n\n**2. Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data handling.  \n- **Anomalies:** Use of open() without context manager, but this is common in setup scripts.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n\n**3. Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, reads 'README.md'.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard setup; no external data flow.  \n- **Anomalies:** Use of open() without context manager; minor best practice issue but not malicious.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, typical setup script.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** Valid; no security issues.\n\n**4. Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows to external systems.  \n- **Anomalies:** No validation or exception handling for file reading, but standard practice in many setup scripts.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, typical package setup.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**5. Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Reads 'README.md' without validation, but this is standard.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation; use of open() without try-except is noted but not malicious.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, standard setup script.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign malware=0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign obfuscated=0, consistent with the code.\n- **Security Risk:** All assign securityRisk=0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** All reports show high confidence (1).\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no handling of untrusted data, and no suspicious constructs. The minor issue of not closing the file with a context manager is not malicious but a best practice note.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are consistent with the code's benign and standard nature.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThe code is a typical setup script with no security concerns.",
