  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'Nvmpy' to facilitate packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the long_description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; standard setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' is used as long_description; no data flows to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context manager; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for packaging, defines package metadata, and reads 'README.md' for long description. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data leaks are present. The code structure is typical for setup scripts, with no anomalies or malicious indicators. The open() call is standard but not closed with a context manager, which is a minor best practice issue but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and is a standard package configuration file with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
