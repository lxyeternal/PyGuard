  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Nvmpy Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Reads local file (README.md) -> used in package metadata during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read a file without validation, but this is typical in setup scripts; no secrets or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools to configure package installation. It specifies package metadata including name, version, author, description, URL, and classifiers. The only file I/O operation is reading README.md for long_description, which is standard practice. There are no dynamic code executions, network connections, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears straightforward and typical for a setup script without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues.",
