  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the Nvmpy Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the long_description from 'README.md', importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data handling that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Reading file content for long_description, passing static configuration parameters to setup() - no flow of untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard setup tools with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with static parameters. No dynamic code execution, no handling of user input, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets. The code appears to be a straightforward package configuration script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply configures package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
