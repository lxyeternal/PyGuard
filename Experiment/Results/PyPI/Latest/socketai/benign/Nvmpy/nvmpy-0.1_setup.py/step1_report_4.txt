  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'Nvmpy' to facilitate packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "open('README.md').read()",
  "sinks": "None (no data flows to external systems or outputs that can be exploited)",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md').read() without validation; no other suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setup tools from setuptools to configure package metadata. It reads the long description directly from a README.md file, which is common practice. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. The code does not perform any network operations, execute untrusted code, or contain any suspicious patterns. The setup parameters appear typical and legitimate, with no hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a benign and typical package setup file.",
