  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; imports setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.md' into long_description; static data flow with no external or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without a context manager, which is a minor best practice issue but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python library. It performs static configuration with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The only minor concern is the use of open() without a context manager, which does not impact security but could be improved for robustness. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly identify it as a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious activity. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
