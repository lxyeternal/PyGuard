{
  "purpose": "Define a Game class that stores a list of code snippets and provides a method to retrieve a snippet based on an index.",
  "sources": "User input (index parameter) used in the text() method to access the code list.",
  "sinks": "Return statement that outputs the code snippet or an error message; no external data sinks or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "Input index -> text() method -> access to Game.codes array -> return value (code snippet or error message).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The code snippets stored are empty strings, indicating placeholders or incomplete code; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The class stores a list of code snippets, which are currently empty strings, and a static method to retrieve a snippet based on an index. The method includes a try-except block to handle invalid indices gracefully. There is no external data input beyond the index parameter, and no dynamic code execution, network activity, or security-sensitive operations observed. The structure appears standard, with no obfuscated code or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward class definition with placeholder code snippets and a safe retrieval method. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. The absence of actual code content prevents further analysis, but as-is, it poses no security threat.",
