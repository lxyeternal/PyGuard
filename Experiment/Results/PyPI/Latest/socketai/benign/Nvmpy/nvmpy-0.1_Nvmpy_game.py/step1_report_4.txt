{
  "purpose": "This class provides a way to retrieve pre-defined code snippets based on an index, potentially used for code management or dynamic code execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'index' parameter from the 'text' method and accesses the 'codes' list to fetch corresponding code snippets.",
  "sinks": "The 'return' statement outputs code snippets or error messages; no untrusted data is directly written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input 'index' flows from the 'text' method to the 'codes' list for retrieval, with exception handling for invalid indices.",
  "anomalies": "The 'codes' list contains empty multi-line strings, which might be placeholders. No actual malicious code or obfuscated content present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The class is simple and primarily designed to store and retrieve code snippets. The code performs safe list indexing with exception handling. The code snippets are empty strings, indicating placeholders rather than malicious payloads. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The structure is straightforward, with no dynamic execution or suspicious behavior. No external network activity, cryptographic operations, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign and appears to be a placeholder or utility for managing code snippets. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on this fragment.",
