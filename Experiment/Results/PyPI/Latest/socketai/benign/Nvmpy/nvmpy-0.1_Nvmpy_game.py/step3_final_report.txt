  "purpose": "A simple class container for code snippets with a retrieval method.",
  "sources": "The 'codes' list containing placeholder strings; the 'text' method accessing list elements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Input index passed to 'text' method flows to list access; no other data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "The 'codes' list contains only empty strings as placeholders; no actual code or secrets embedded.",
  "analysis": "The class 'Game' defines a list of placeholder strings and a static method to retrieve snippets by index with bounds checking. The snippets are empty, indicating placeholders rather than actual code. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious content is present. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign and placeholder nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a container for code snippets with no malicious intent or security risks. The placeholder content and straightforward structure justify the low malware, obfuscation, and risk scores. All reports accurately reflect this assessment.",
