{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class Game with a list of code snippets and a static method to retrieve a specific code snippet based on an index.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'index' parameter passed to the text() method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write to files, execute untrusted code, or send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input 'index' flows into the text() method and determines which element of the codes list is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains empty string entries in the codes list, which could be placeholders, but they are not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The class Game maintains a list of code snippets. The static method text() takes an index and returns the corresponding code snippet from the list, with error handling for out-of-range indices. The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leaks, or code injection. The empty strings in the list are placeholders and do not indicate malicious intent. The overall structure is straightforward and does not contain complex or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple container for code snippets with a safe retrieval method. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation appears benign and intended for safe use.",
