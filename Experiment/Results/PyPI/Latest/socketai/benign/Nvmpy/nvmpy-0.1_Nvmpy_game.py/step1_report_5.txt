  "purpose": "The class 'Game' appears to store a list of code snippets and provides a method to retrieve a specific snippet based on an index.",
  "sources": "The method 'text' reads the 'index' parameter provided by the caller.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks in the code that process or execute untrusted data, as the method only returns stored string values.",
  "flows": "The input 'index' flows from the method argument to the list access, with exception handling for out-of-range values.",
  "anomalies": "The 'codes' list contains empty string entries, which may suggest placeholders; however, no malicious code or obfuscation is present. The code does not perform any suspicious operations or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a static method that retrieves code snippets from a list based on an index. The list contains empty strings, which may be placeholders for future content. The method includes basic bounds checking and returns an error message if the index is invalid. There is no dynamic execution, data manipulation, or external data processing. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The code structure is simple and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign container for code snippets with a simple retrieval method. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
