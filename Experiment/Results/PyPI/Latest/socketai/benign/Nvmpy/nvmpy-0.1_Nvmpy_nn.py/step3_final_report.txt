{
  "purpose": "Static container class storing multiple code snippets as strings, retrievable by index, with no execution or data handling within the class.",
  "sources": "The class stores string literals representing code snippets; no data input, external calls, or dynamic behavior occurs here.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, no external data transmission, no code execution; purely static storage.",
  "flows": "None; the class only provides access to stored strings without processing.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no malicious code, no secrets, and no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The class is a benign static repository of code snippets related to ML, data analysis, and statistical routines. The snippets themselves are standard, well-structured code with no signs of malicious intent. No obfuscation, network activity, or external data handling is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the stored content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and align with the analysis. No improvements or changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
