  "purpose": "Asynchronous functions retrieving device platform and NED IDs via helper methods with logging and error handling.",
  "sources": "Calls to devices_helper.get_device_platform and devices_helper.get_device_ned_ids executed in asyncio.to_thread",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external network calls outside helper methods; logs are for internal monitoring",
  "flows": "Source: helper method calls; Sink: response construction and logging",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard async patterns with proper exception handling, logging, and response formatting. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. Helper methods are invoked securely, and no external network communication occurs outside these calls. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and free from malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
