  "purpose": "Factory class for creating and configuring loggers with specified file names and levels.",
  "sources": "Input parameters log_file and log_level in get_logger and __create_logger methods.",
  "sinks": "FileHandler writes logs to specified files; no untrusted data flows to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate log file paths and set logging levels, then logs are written to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Logging configuration appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logger factory with methods to create and retrieve loggers, storing them in a dictionary to avoid duplicate configuration. It uses user-provided file names and levels to configure loggers. The log file names are directly derived from input parameters without any evident sanitization or validation, but this is a common practice. No data leakage, external connections, or malicious code is present. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are observed. The code’s structure and logic are typical for logging setup, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard logger factory implementation without malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious or harmful operations. The code is straightforward and safe.",
