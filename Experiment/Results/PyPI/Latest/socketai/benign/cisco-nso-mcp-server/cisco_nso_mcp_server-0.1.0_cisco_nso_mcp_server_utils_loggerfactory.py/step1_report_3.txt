{
  "purpose": "Create and configure loggers for application modules, with options for different log levels and file handlers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: log_file, log_level",
  "sinks": "FileHandler writes logs to a file named based on log_file parameter; no untrusted data flows identified outside logging configuration",
  "flows": "Parameters (log_file, log_level) are used to set up logging outputs; no flow leads to untrusted system actions or external data exfiltration",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual dynamic code execution. Logging configuration appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logger factory class with methods to create and retrieve loggers, storing them in a dictionary. It uses parameters for log file names and levels, configures file handlers with standard format, and sets log levels based on input strings. No untrusted data handling beyond basic parameter usage. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. It avoids common security pitfalls like dynamic code execution or hardcoded credentials. The design is typical for logging setup and does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward logger factory implementation without malicious behavior or security risks. It safely manages loggers and does not expose sensitive data or enable malicious activities.",
