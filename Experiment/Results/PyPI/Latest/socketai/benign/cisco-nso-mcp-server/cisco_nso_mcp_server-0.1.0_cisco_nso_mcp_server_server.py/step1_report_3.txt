  "purpose": "This script implements a Cisco NSO MCP server providing network automation tools and resources via RESTCONF, primarily for retrieving environment summaries and device information.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for NSO and MCP configurations (NSO_SCHEME, NSO_ADDRESS, NSO_PORT, NSO_TIMEOUT, NSO_USERNAME, NSO_PASSWORD, MCP_TRANSPORT, MCP_HOST, MCP_PORT).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code mainly interacts with external services via the NSORestconfClient and exposes APIs through the MCP server. No direct data leaks or untrusted command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Configuration inputs flow from environment variables and command-line arguments into client setup and server registration functions. Data retrieval from NSO occurs through the client, with responses returned via the registered resources and tools.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of environment variables for sensitive data is standard but should be handled carefully; no hardcoded secrets are present. No obfuscated code or unusual control flow observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a REST API server to interface with Cisco NSO via RESTCONF, exposing endpoints for environment summaries and device info. Configuration parameters are sourced from environment variables or command-line arguments, which is common. The script uses asynchronous functions for resource registration, with error handling that logs errors and returns error messages. The client and server components are initialized securely with user-configurable parameters. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or system manipulation. All inputs are handled explicitly, and no unsafe code execution or network connections are directly embedded in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured server implementation for Cisco NSO network automation, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It relies on user-provided configuration and standard library usage, with no suspicious activity detected.",
