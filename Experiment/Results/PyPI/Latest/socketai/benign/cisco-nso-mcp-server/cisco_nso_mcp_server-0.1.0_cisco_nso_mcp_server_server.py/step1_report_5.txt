  "purpose": "This script implements a Cisco NSO MCP server for network automation and provides REST API resources and tools for interacting with Cisco NSO devices.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (NSO_SCHEME, NSO_ADDRESS, NSO_PORT, NSO_TIMEOUT, NSO_USERNAME, NSO_PASSWORD, MCP_TRANSPORT, MCP_HOST, MCP_PORT); user-provided parameters via API (device_name, etc.)",
  "sinks": "Parameters used in API responses, environment variables for NSO credentials, command-line arguments for server configuration",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables and API parameters flows into NSO client initialization and request handling; user inputs for device info flow into service functions and responses",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets beyond default 'admin'/'admin'; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution; no network connections to suspicious domains or system modifications observed",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a REST API server with configurable parameters for connecting to Cisco NSO, utilizing environment variables and user input. It registers resource endpoints and tools that invoke service functions, which in turn call the NSO client. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. Sensitive information is passed via environment variables, which is standard practice. The code structure and imports suggest legitimate usage aligned with network automation tasks. No anomalies or malicious behavior identified. The overall security posture appears sound, assuming dependencies are trusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a network automation server with no signs of malicious behavior. It relies on environment variables and user parameters for configuration, and no suspicious code patterns or network activity are present. Overall, it appears safe, provided dependencies are secure.",
