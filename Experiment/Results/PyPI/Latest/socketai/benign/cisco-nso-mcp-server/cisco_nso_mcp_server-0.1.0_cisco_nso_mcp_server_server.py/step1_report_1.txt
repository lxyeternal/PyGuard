{
  "purpose": "Implement a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Cisco NSO, providing network automation tools via RESTCONF.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for NSO connection details, command-line arguments for server configuration, external modules for network and device data.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data handling in API responses, error messages in logs, parameters in tools and resource functions.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and command-line arguments flows into server configuration; API request parameters flow into device info retrieval functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected; environment variables and parameters are handled securely and appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up an MCP server for network automation, with environment variables and CLI args controlling configuration. It uses secure patterns for parameter validation and error handling. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. No suspicious external communication, backdoors, or hidden functions are present. Usage of external modules appears standard, and no obfuscated code or malware indicators are detected. The functions mostly delegate to external service layers for actual data handling, which are assumed to be standard and secure. The server's security depends on external modules and environment configurations, but the script itself does not introduce risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard server setup for Cisco NSO MCP, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks apparent. It correctly handles configuration inputs, error conditions, and resource registration without evident vulnerabilities.",
