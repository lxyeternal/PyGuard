  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with straightforward imports and module exports; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a simple module to expose logging utilities. It imports specific functions and exposes them via __all__, with no input handling, data processing, or external data flows. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security issues. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for module exports, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a straightforward utility module without any malicious intent or security risks.",
