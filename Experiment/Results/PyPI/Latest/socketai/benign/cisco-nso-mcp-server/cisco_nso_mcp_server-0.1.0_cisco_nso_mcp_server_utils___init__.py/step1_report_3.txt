  "sources": "Import statement from cisco_nso_mcp_server.utils.logging",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only imports and re-exports log-related objects",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected; simple import and export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code only imports logger and LoggerFactory from a utility module and exposes them via __all__. There are no dynamic code executions, hardcoded secrets, network operations, or other suspicious behaviors. The structure is straightforward and aligns with typical utility module patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
