  "purpose": "Utility module providing logging functionalities for Cisco NSO MCP Server",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'logger' and 'LoggerFactory' from an internal module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or user inputs present",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks, as the code only imports and exposes logging components",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; straightforward module for exposing imported components",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific logging components from an internal package and exposes them via __all__ for easier access. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or network activity. The code is minimal, simple, and appears to be standard practice for utility modules. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module intended for exposing logging functionalities. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
