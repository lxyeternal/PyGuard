  "purpose": "A minimal utility module that imports and exposes logging utilities for use in other parts of the system.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'cisco_nso_mcp_server.utils.logging' (logger, LoggerFactory)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no data sinks or external communications present",
  "flows": "Import of logger components, then exposing them via __all__; no data flow beyond module scope",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export of utility functions, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports logging utilities and exposes them via __all__. It contains no data processing, input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code structure is standard and benign. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
