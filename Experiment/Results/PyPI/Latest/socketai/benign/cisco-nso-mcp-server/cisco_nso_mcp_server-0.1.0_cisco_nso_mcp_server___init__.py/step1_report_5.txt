  "purpose": "The code appears to describe a module for a Cisco NSO MCP server that facilitates network automation via RESTCONF.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reads are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only contains comments and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, consisting of only a descriptive comment, version string, and module docstring without functional code.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a simple module header with no functional implementation. It contains a docstring describing its purpose and a version attribute. There are no inputs, data processing, or output points. Given the lack of executable or data handling code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The absence of any operational code makes it unlikely to contain malicious activity or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module header with no executable logic or data handling. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
