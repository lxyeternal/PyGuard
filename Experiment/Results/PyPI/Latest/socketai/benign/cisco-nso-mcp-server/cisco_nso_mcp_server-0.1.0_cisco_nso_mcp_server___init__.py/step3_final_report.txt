  "purpose": "This module implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides network automation tools for interacting with Cisco NSO via RESTCONF.",
  "sources": "No input sources; only a version string and descriptive comments.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code contains only static documentation and version info.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious constructs; purely descriptive.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal, consisting solely of comments, a version string, and a module docstring. There are no functions, data flows, input/output, or network activity. The code does not contain obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as a benign placeholder or documentation stub. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk score is also zero, reflecting the lack of any security concerns. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal documentation or placeholder module with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports and scores are consistent with this assessment. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
