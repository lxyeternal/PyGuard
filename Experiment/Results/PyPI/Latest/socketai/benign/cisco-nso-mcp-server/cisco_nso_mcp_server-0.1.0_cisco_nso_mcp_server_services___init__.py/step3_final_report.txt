  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic execution functions (eval/exec), hardcoded strings, network or file operations, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (eval/exec, hardcoded URLs) leading to potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, complex string manipulations, dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials or URLs, convoluted logic.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits varying degrees of obfuscation and dynamic execution. Reports 1 and 3 show significant suspicious patterns, including obfuscation (scores ~0.7), dynamic code (eval/exec), and hardcoded secrets, justifying higher malware and risk scores (~0.6-0.7). Reports 2, 4, and 5 lack such patterns, with low or zero scores, indicating benign or non-analyzed code. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with no evidence of confirmed malicious actions. The overall suspicion aligns with the scores assigned, with Report 3 being the most concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The provided scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Reports 1 and 3 warrant higher concern due to obfuscation and suspicious patterns, while Reports 2, 4, and 5 are benign. No adjustments are necessary.",
