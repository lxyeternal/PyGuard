{
  "purpose": "To provide a simplified logging interface for the Cisco NSO MCP Server by exposing a pre-configured logger and the LoggerFactory for advanced use.",
  "sources": "Import statements pulling 'default_logger' and 'LoggerFactory' from external modules within 'cisco_nso_mcp_server.utils'.",
  "sinks": "Not explicitly present; the code only exposes objects and does not process untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process data flows from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard for a logging module. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. No suspicious dynamic execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a logger object and a factory class from internal modules and exposes them for external use. The structure is simple, with no evident malicious behavior. The code is primarily for configuration and modular design, not executing any dangerous actions or processing untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for logging purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It simply exposes existing components for external use.",
