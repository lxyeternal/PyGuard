{
  "purpose": "Provides a simplified logging interface by importing and exposing a default logger and a logger factory from internal modules.",
  "sources": "Imports 'default_logger' and 'LoggerFactory' from 'cisco_nso_mcp_server.utils.loggerfactory'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external communication, or data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "Imports are assigned to local names and re-exported; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and serves as an interface layer for logging utilities. It performs simple imports and re-exports without processing user input, external data, or executing dynamic code. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security risks. It functions solely as a wrapper for existing logging components, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current security assessment and scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
