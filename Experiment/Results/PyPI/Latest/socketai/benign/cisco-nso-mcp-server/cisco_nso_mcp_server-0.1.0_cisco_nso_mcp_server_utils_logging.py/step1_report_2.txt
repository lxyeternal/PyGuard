  "purpose": "To provide a simplified logging interface for the Cisco NSO MCP Server by exposing a pre-configured logger and the LoggerFactory for advanced use.",
  "sources": "Imports from cisco_nso_mcp_server.utils.loggerfactory: default_logger and LoggerFactory",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs; only module exports and import statements",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no runtime data flows from untrusted sources; no data flows to external systems",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs; straightforward module export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports a logger object and a factory class from a local utility module and exposes them for external use. There are no data processing, input reading, or untrusted data handling mechanisms present. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs detected. The code serves a simple purpose of exposing logging utilities, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module for exposing logging utilities, with no signs of malicious code or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or perform any suspicious operations.",
