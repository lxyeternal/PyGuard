  "purpose": "Provide a simplified logging interface for the Cisco NSO MCP Server, exposing a pre-configured logger and LoggerFactory for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements loading 'default_logger' and 'LoggerFactory' from 'cisco_nso_mcp_server.utils.loggerfactory'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external output mechanisms are present; the code only imports and re-exports components.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of unusual constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. It only imports and exposes existing components.",
  "analysis": "The module imports 'default_logger' and 'LoggerFactory' from a specific internal package and exposes them via '__all__'. There is no user input handling, data processing, or external communication. The code serves as a simple interface for logging components, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple interface layer exposing logging components; it contains no malicious code or security risks. It is a standard pattern for modular Python packages.",
