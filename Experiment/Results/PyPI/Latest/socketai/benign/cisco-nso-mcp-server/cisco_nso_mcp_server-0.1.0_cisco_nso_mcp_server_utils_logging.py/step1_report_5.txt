  "purpose": "Provides a simplified logging interface for the Cisco NSO MCP Server by importing and exposing a default logger and the LoggerFactory for advanced use.",
  "sources": "Import statements pulling 'default_logger' and 'LoggerFactory' from external modules 'cisco_nso_mcp_server.utils.loggerfactory'.",
  "sinks": "None detected. The code does not process untrusted data or include sinks that could leak information or cause harm.",
  "flows": "The code imports external components and exposes them; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed. The code appears straightforward and standard for logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The module imports a default logger and a factory for advanced logging configurations, then exposes them via __all__. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is minimal, focused solely on re-exporting components for logging, and uses conventional import/export patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple interface for logging setup. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected. The code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
