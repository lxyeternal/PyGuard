  "purpose": "Retrieve and analyze device environment data from NSO, generating insights on device counts, OS distribution, versions, models, and series.",
  "sources": "Data retrieved via query_helper.query_device_platform, which reads device platform info; no untrusted input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Processed data stored in dictionaries; no sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from query_helper.query_device_platform to processing functions (_process_device_data, _generate_insights), then to the final response structure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code asynchronously queries device platform data, processes it into structured dictionaries, and generates environment insights such as device count, OS distribution, versions, models, and series. It uses standard libraries, exception handling, and logging. No external network activity beyond the initial query, no data exfiltration, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code are present. The functions perform safe, routine data processing without any malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard data collection and analysis, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0-0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
