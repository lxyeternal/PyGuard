  "purpose": "Retrieve and process NSO environment device data to generate an environment summary with insights.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'query_helper.query_device_platform', environment timestamp from datetime.now()",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data output or external network interactions",
  "flows": "Data retrieved from query_helper, processed internally, and formatted into a response object",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious function calls",
  "analysis": "The code asynchronously queries device platform data, processes this data into structured formats, and generates insights like device counts, OS distribution, and device models. No external network connections, no file system modifications, and no use of untrusted input outside of the provided query. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; code appears to be straightforward data processing. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated patterns. The use of asyncio and structured exception handling indicates standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data collection and processing module for device environment insights with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs benign data handling and formatting tasks.",
