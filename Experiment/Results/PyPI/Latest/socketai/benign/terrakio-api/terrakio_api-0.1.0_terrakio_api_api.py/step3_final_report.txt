  "purpose": "A function to perform an API POST request with error handling and SSL verification.",
  "sources": "session.post() call, response.json() for error details",
  "sinks": "Response object returned; potential error message construction",
  "flows": "Input payload to session.post(), response to error handling or return",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward request and error handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API request wrapper that uses requests.Session.post() to send data, handles HTTP errors by parsing JSON error details, and raises a custom APIError. It verifies SSL certificates by default and does not contain hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. Error handling is appropriate, and no suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is clear, well-structured, and follows best practices for network requests.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API request function with proper error handling and SSL verification. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
