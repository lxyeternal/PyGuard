{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a file from a specified URL and writes it to a file or file-like object.",
  "sources": "Reads URL input, reads from response stream, reads target filename or file-like object.",
  "sinks": "Writes data chunks to file or file-like object.",
  "flows": "URL input -> HTTP response stream -> data chunks -> target file or file-like object.",
  "anomalies": "Uses response.iter_content without validation of response content; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code; straightforward download logic.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles HTTP requests with optional session reuse and verifies SSL certificates by default. It streams data to prevent memory issues and supports writing to files or file-like objects. Error handling wraps request exceptions in custom DownloadError. No suspicious or malicious operations are present. No unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets are detected. The logic is standard for downloading files over HTTP.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation of a file downloader without malicious intent or security issues.",
