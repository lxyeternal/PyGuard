  "purpose": "The function downloads a file from a specified URL and writes it to a given target, which can be a file path, file-like object, or binary stream.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the 'url' parameter for the download source.",
  "sinks": "Writes downloaded data to the specified 'target' (file path, file-like object, or stream). No other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the URL (source) through the network request, streamed in chunks, to the target destination (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code handles exceptions properly. It uses a standard download pattern with stream handling. No obfuscation or malicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code securely performs file download over HTTP/HTTPS, streaming data in chunks to avoid memory issues. It properly handles different target types and manages the session lifecycle responsibly. No insecure data handling, code injection points, or malicious behaviors are observed. It does not perform any suspicious network communications beyond the intended download. No anomalies such as embedded malicious logic, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration methods are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, well-structured file download utility function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscation and appears safe for use.",
