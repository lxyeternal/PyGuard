  "purpose": "Download a file from a URL, writing it to a specified target (filename, Path, or file-like object).",
  "sources": "The URL input in the requests.get call; the target parameter for writing data.",
  "sinks": "Writing chunks to a file or file-like object; potential data leakage if target is untrusted, but not malicious.",
  "flows": "URL input → response.iter_content → write to target.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code follows standard download pattern without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a file downloader using requests, with proper session management, streaming, and error handling. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The code does not perform any network activity beyond downloading, nor does it execute or process downloaded data maliciously. The malware score is 0, as there are no indicators of malicious intent. The security risk is very low (around 0.1-0.2), mainly due to the inherent risk of downloading from untrusted URLs, which is outside the scope of the code's logic. The confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented file downloader with no malicious or obfuscated components. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
