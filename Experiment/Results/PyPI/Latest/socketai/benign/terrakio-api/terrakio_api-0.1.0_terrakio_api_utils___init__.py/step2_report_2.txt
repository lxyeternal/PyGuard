  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n**Code Review:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python module that imports specific functions from a local 'validation' module and defines an `__all__` list to specify what symbols are exported.\n- There are no dynamic code executions, no network calls, no data processing, and no hardcoded secrets.\n- The module appears to serve as a simple re-exporting utility, which is common in Python packages.\n\n**Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n- The code does not contain any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies.\n- No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n- The logic is static and minimal, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — No security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are evident.\n\n**Review of the Reports:**\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for utility modules.\n- They assign maximum confidence (1) and zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable given the code.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all conclusions are based on static analysis.\n- Since the code is purely import/export, there's no basis for higher risk scores.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, standard utility module with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
