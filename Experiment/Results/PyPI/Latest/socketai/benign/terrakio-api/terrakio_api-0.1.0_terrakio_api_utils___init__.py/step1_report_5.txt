  "purpose": "Utility functions for the Terrakio API client, likely to validate and create geographic features.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions from a local module named 'validation'. No input data sources are evident in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or cause side effects such as network operations, file writes, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports functions and defines an export list; no data flow occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors. The code appears straightforward, importing and exporting functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module and defines an __all__ list to specify exports. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or security-sensitive operations present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or anomalies are visible in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for setting up module exports and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and purposeful for utility function organization.",
