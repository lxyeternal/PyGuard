{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a utility module that re-exports specific functions from a local validation package for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from the local '.validation' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data outputs; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only imports functions and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal utility module that imports three functions and exposes them via __all__. It contains no executable logic, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities within this snippet. The only potential concern could be the imported functions' security, but that cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code is standard, safe, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and should be maintained.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
