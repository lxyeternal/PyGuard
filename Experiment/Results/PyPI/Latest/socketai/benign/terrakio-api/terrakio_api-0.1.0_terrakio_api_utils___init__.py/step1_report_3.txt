  "purpose": "Utility functions for the Terrakio API client, specifically for validation and feature creation.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local validation module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are explicitly present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are observable within this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a local module 'validation' and defines an __all__ list to specify exported symbols. It appears to be a standard module that re-exports specific functions. No input reading, no data processing, no network operations, or other suspicious activities are present. The code is minimal and appears to be a straightforward utility module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, non-malicious module setup for utility functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
