  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll five reports uniformly conclude that the code is a straightforward, benign utility module that imports functions from a local validation module and declares an `__all__` list for exports. No suspicious activity, malicious code, or security risks are identified. The code is minimal, with no data flows, external network interactions, or obfuscated patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is very simple; it only imports functions and defines an export list. There are no hidden or malicious operations.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** All reports agree on zero malware and obfuscation scores.\n- **Security risks:** No security risks are indicated, and the code doesn't process untrusted data or perform any risky operations.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Logical flaws or mistakes:** No logical flaws are apparent; the code is standard for a utility module.\n- **Scores assessment:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n  - **Risk score:** All are 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- Since the code only imports and exports functions, and no suspicious patterns or data flows are present, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is appropriate given the straightforward analysis.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall consensus and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The scores are accurate; the code is safe, and the reports correctly reflect that.",
