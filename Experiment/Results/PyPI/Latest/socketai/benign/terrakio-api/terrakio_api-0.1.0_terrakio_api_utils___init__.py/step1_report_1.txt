  "purpose": "Utility functions for the Terrakio API client, specifically for validation and feature creation.",
  "sources": "Imports validation functions from a local module: .validation",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or output is evident",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and declares exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward module export",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local validation module and defines an __all__ list to specify public API symbols. It is a simple, standard module setup without dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or network interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. The structure and content are typical for a utility module.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It only imports functions and declares an export list, with no suspicious or harmful operations.",
