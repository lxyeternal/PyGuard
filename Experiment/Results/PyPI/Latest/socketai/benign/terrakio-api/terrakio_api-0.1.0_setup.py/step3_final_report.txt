  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'terrakio_api', configuring metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package list; static metadata fields; explicit dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input, network activity, or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration with no external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with explicit package listing and static content.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup.py script for packaging a Python module. It reads a local README file, explicitly lists packages, and specifies dependencies. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscation, or external input handling. The code does not perform any network activity or data leakage. All signals indicate a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0. The overall security posture is benign.",
