{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'terrakio_api', specifying metadata, dependencies, and package structure.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; static string definitions in setup() parameters; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks within this script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with explicit package listing and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, reads a local 'README.md' file to include long description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All data appears static and intended for package configuration. No dynamic code execution, external input, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not process untrusted input or include obfuscated/malicious code.",
