  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios in an application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from the Exception base class, with docstrings explaining their purpose. There are no dynamic code executions, data handling, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code constructs, and no obfuscation detected. The code appears to be a standard pattern for custom error handling in Python applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard definition of custom exception classes with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies. It is a benign and typical pattern used in Python programming.",
