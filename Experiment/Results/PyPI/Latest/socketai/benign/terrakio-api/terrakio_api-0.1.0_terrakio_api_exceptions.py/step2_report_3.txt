  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from `Exception`.\n- No data input/output, data processing, external calls, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes with no malicious or suspicious content.  \n  **No issues or malicious behavior are present in the code.**\n\n---\n\n### Logical and reasoning review:\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard. This is accurate.  \n  No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.  \n  **The reasoning is sound and consistent.**\n\n---\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes, they are consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports emphasize the lack of external data, suspicious constructs, or malicious behavior, which is correct.\n- No false positives or negatives are apparent here.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no adjustments are necessary.**\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The scores are appropriate, and there's no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python, with no security concerns.",
