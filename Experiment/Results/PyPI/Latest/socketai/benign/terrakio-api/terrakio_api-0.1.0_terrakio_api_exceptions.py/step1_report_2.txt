  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for API response handling, configuration issues, download failures, and validation errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, input reading, or data fetching; only class and exception definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or external calls.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input-output operations, or untrusted data paths present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. Exception classes are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, each with a descriptive docstring. The classes are simple, with no additional logic, data handling, or side effects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. The code appears to serve as part of a larger application to categorize and handle errors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is benign and typical for error handling in Python projects.",
