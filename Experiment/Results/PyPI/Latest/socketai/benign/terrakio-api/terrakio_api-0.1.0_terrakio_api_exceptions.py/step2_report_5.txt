  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as consisting solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception.\n- No data inputs, outputs, external interactions, or complex logic are present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated constructs are identified.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are all zero, which aligns with the code content.\n\n**Confirming code presence:**\n- The original code matches the descriptions: simple class definitions with no additional logic.\n- No issues or discrepancies are found between the code and the reports.\n\n**Error, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- The securityRisk score is 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The confidence score is 1, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since the code is only class definitions, there's no scope for malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, safe pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python, with no security concerns.",
