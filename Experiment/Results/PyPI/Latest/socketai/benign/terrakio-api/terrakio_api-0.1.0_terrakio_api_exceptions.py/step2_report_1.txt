  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code and considering the security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining simple custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`.\n- No data inputs, external interactions, or complex logic are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n- The code appears to be a standard pattern for error handling in Python.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code content:\n- The original code matches the descriptions: straightforward class definitions for exceptions with docstrings.\n- No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or malicious code are evident.\n- No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present.\n\n### Evaluation of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and free of security issues.\n- They correctly identify that the classes are simple, with no data flow, external data handling, or malicious intent.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. All reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which is justified.  \n  The `securityRisk` score is also 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.  \n  The `obfuscated` score is 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n- **Any assumptions that should be challenged?**  \n  The reports assume that defining exception classes is inherently benign, which is generally true. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Given the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign pattern for defining custom exceptions.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, straightforward, and typical for error handling in Python. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
