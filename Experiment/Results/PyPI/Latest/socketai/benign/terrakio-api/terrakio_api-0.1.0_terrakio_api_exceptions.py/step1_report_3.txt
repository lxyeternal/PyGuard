  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions in an application.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of exception class declarations with no additional logic or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, each representing specific error types (API, configuration, download, validation). There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing logic present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The classes are straightforward and standard in Python for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple and benign set of custom exception definitions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
