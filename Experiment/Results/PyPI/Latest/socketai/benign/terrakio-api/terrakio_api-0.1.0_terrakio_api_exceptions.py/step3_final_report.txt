  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from 'Exception' with no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code contains only class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class definitions do not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of simple class definitions for custom exceptions, each inheriting from 'Exception' and containing descriptive docstrings. There are no data inputs, external calls, or complex logic. The code is standard for error handling in Python. All reports correctly identify the benign and straightforward nature of the code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
