  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error cases in an application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data output; exception classes do not perform actions beyond inheritance.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data passing through; classes are simple exception subclasses.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from the base Exception class. There are no data inputs, no data processing, and no external interactions or obfuscated elements. The structure is typical for defining custom exceptions in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of custom exception definitions with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
