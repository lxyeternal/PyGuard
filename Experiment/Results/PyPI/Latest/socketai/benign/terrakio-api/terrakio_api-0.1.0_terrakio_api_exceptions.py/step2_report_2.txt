  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the underlying code to ensure the assessments are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm presence of issues in the code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from `Exception`. There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or complex logic. The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n**Step 2: Check for errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning**  \n- The reports uniformly state that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- They correctly note the absence of data flow, external interactions, or suspicious constructs.  \n- The reasoning is consistent and sound: defining exception classes is a common, benign pattern.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious or suspicious code.  \n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.  \n- **Confidence score:** All are 1, indicating high confidence in their benign assessment.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**  \n- No evidence suggests any risk or malicious intent. The code is purely definitional, with no runtime behavior or external interactions.  \n- The reports' scores are consistent with this.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any assumptions about vulnerabilities**  \n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.  \n- There are no unwarranted assumptions.\n\n**Step 6: Check for consistency in scores**  \n- The scores are consistent across all reports, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional considerations:**  \n- Since the code is only class definitions, there's no possibility of hidden malicious behavior unless the classes are used maliciously elsewhere, which is outside the scope of these snippets.  \n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and standard for defining custom exceptions.  \n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.  \n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.  \n- The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the assessments provided.**",
