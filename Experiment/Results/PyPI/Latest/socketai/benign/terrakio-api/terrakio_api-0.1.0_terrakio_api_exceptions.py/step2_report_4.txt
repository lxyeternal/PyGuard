  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of simple class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No data inputs, outputs, external interactions, or dynamic code are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The purpose across all reports is consistent: defining error classes for various failure scenarios.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating certainty about benign nature.\n- Malware scores are 0 in all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risks are rated as 0, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Confirming the code's content:**\n- The original code defines five exception classes, each inheriting from `Exception`, with descriptive docstrings.\n- No code execution, data handling, or external calls are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n\n**Assessment of the reports:**\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and without security issues.\n- Their reasoning is sound, and their conclusions justified.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk score of 0 aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since the code is simple class definitions, there's no reason to assign any higher risk scores.\n- The reports do not suggest any hidden malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign, standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python. No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- No further action needed.",
