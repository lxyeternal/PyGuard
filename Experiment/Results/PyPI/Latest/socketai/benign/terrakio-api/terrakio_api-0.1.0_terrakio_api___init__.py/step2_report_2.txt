  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple module initializer, setting up version info, importing local components, and defining exports.\n- No external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code appears to be a standard `__init__.py` or module setup for a Python package.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is purely structural, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with their analysis.\n- The confidence level is high (1) in all reports, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Critical assessment:**\n- The code provided is minimal and standard for a package's entry point.\n- There are no indications of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious activity.\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that because the code is static, it cannot be malicious. While this is generally true for such module setup files, it is important to consider that malicious code could be hidden elsewhere in the package.\n- However, based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at **0**.\n- The overall security risk score should be **0**.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Given the evidence, I agree with the current scores.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard package initialization with no security concerns.",
