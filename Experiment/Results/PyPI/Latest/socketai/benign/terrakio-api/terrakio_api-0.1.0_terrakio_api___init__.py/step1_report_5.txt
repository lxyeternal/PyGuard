  "purpose": "This code defines the module's metadata, imports, and exports for a Python client library to access Terrakio's Web Coverage Service API.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this snippet; it primarily imports modules and defines metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data output or external communication is performed here.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink within this code segment; it is mainly configuration and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of module docstring, version assignment, imports, and __all__ declaration. All elements are standard and contain no dynamic or malicious behavior. No external data, user input, or network activities are involved. The code appears to be straightforward module setup code for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module definition with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves as a clean setup for a Python client library without any suspicious activity.",
