  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data handling or external network operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors identified. The code appears to be standard module initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions from local modules, defines a version string, and specifies exports. There are no dynamic code executions, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations present. It is a typical package __init__.py file serving as an API entry point.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward package initialization file with no malicious intent or security issues. It solely manages imports and exports for a Python package. No signs of malware or security risks detected.",
