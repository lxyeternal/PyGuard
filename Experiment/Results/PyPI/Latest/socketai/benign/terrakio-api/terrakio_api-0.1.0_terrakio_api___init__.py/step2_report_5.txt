  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, focusing on the details provided and cross-checking with the code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code in question is a minimal, straightforward module initialization script for a Python package. It defines version info, imports core components from local modules, and declares what symbols are exported.\n- No external data processing, network calls, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input are present.\n- The code is typical for a package's `__init__.py` or main module, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports describe the code as a standard package setup, which aligns with the code provided. No issues or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or security flaws?**  \n  None detected. The code does not process untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or handle sensitive information.  \n  **Conclusion:** No errors or flaws are present.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Security Risk:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's benign purpose.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n### Justification for any high risk scores:\n- Since all reports assign zero risk, and the code is a simple module initializer, there is no justification for higher scores.\n\n### Challenge assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is benign, which is correct. No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are warranted here.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, safe package setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive elements.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical Python package initialization file, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
