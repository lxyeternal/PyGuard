{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the package initializer for a Python client library, setting up version info, importing core components, and defining exported symbols.",
  "sources": "No external sources; static code with imports from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; static import and export setup only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py or module entry point, defining version, importing classes/functions, and setting __all__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or input handling. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
