{
  "purpose": "This code defines the entry point for a Python client library for interacting with Terrakio's Web Coverage Service (WCS) API, establishing exports and module metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .client, .config, .exceptions",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external calls are visible",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows or untrusted data processing observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module metadata, version, and exports. It imports core components like Client, configuration creators, and exception classes from local modules. There are no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, no use of environment variables, and no user input handling. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or main module file. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module initialization file for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks.",
