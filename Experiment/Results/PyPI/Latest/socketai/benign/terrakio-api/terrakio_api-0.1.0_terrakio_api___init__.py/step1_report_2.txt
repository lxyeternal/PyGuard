  "purpose": "This code serves as a module for a Python client library for accessing Terrakio's Web Coverage Service API, providing imports, version info, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read; all imports are from local modules or standard library.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data outputs that process untrusted data; no potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. The version string is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of module metadata, version info, import statements, and __all__ exports. It does not process any input or execute any logic that could be malicious. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer for a Python client library with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and straightforward.",
