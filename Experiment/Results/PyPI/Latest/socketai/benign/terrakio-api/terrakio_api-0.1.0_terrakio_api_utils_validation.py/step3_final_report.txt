  "purpose": "Provides functions to validate and create GeoJSON Feature objects, specifically Point and Polygon features, ensuring structural correctness.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'feature' dictionary, 'lon', 'lat', and 'coordinates' lists, and optional 'properties' dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or leak data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct GeoJSON feature dictionaries; validation functions check the structure and types without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard validation and object creation without suspicious patterns or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing basic type and structure validation for GeoJSON features and creating feature objects with optional properties. It ensures polygon closure by appending the first coordinate if needed. There are no external system calls, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The import from a relative module is typical for modular codebases. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal risk score (0.1) in some reports is justified by the import statement but does not indicate actual security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and safe for use. It performs expected validation and creation tasks without malicious or suspicious elements. The low security risk score is appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
