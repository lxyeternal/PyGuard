{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to validate and create GeoJSON Feature objects, specifically for Point and Polygon geometries.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as feature dictionaries, coordinates, longitude, latitude, and optional properties; also, data in the 'feature' dictionary for validation.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write or send data externally; they only process and return data structures.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed directly; no external data flow or untrusted data handling beyond function arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or behaviors. The code performs straightforward validation and data construction.",
  "analysis": "The code validates GeoJSON Feature dictionaries to ensure proper structure and types, raising ValidationError if invalid. The create_point_feature function constructs a Point feature with given coordinates and optional properties, defaulting to empty if none provided. The create_polygon_feature function constructs a Polygon feature, automatically closing the polygon if not already closed. No malicious code, external network calls, or hidden behaviors are present. The functions handle data safely, with no apparent security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard, and intended for GeoJSON data handling. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The functions perform validation and data structuring without external dependencies or unsafe operations.",
