{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to validate and create GeoJSON Feature objects, specifically Point and Polygon features, including validation for correct structure and properties.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'feature' dictionary in validate_feature, 'lon', 'lat', 'coordinates', and 'properties' in create_point_feature and create_polygon_feature functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks are present; the functions return constructed dictionaries and perform validation without writing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function arguments into validation checks and object creation. No untrusted data is sent to external systems or used insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs basic validation and object creation; it does not include any suspicious or unusual code patterns. There are no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly handles GeoJSON object validation and creation, with straightforward input validation and object construction. No external system calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The polygon creation function ensures the polygon is closed by appending the first coordinate if necessary, which is standard practice. No unsafe code constructs or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured GeoJSON utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs validation and object creation securely without external side effects.",
