{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to validate and create GeoJSON Feature objects, specifically Points and Polygons, for geospatial data handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'feature' dictionary in validate_feature, 'lon', 'lat', 'coordinates', and 'properties' in creation functions.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs and returns dictionaries representing GeoJSON features; no sinks like network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through validation and construction functions, resulting in GeoJSON feature dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. No dynamic code execution or external data handling. The code imports an exception class from a relative module but does not use or manipulate external inputs or system data.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly focuses on validation and creation of GeoJSON features, employing straightforward data checks and dictionary constructions. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or include any potentially malicious code. The import statement from a relative module ('..exceptions') is standard for modular code and does not introduce security concerns. The functions validate input data types and structure, but do not process external data sources or execute untrusted code. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The logic is typical for data validation and object creation, with no evident security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is secure, clean, and performs basic data validation and construction for GeoJSON features. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk score is low.",
