{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions to validate and create GeoJSON feature objects, specifically Points and Polygons.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: feature dictionary, longitude, latitude, coordinates list, and optional properties dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Return statements generating GeoJSON feature dictionaries; no sinks that process untrusted data beyond returning data structures.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into return objects; validation functions check data types and structure before use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation of input data structures and creates GeoJSON features with basic data validation. It uses standard Python constructs, with no external network calls, code injection points, or sensitive data handling. The polygon creation function ensures the polygon is closed by appending the first coordinate if needed, which is a standard approach. No malicious or backdoor code detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical data processing patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for creating and validating GeoJSON features. No malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is safe to use within expected parameters.",
