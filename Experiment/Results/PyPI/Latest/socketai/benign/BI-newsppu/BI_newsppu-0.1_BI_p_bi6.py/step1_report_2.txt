{
  "purpose": "This code performs KMeans clustering analysis on the Iris dataset, including data standardization, optimal cluster number determination via elbow method and silhouette score, and visualization of the clustering results.",
  "sources": "Loads Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets; reads data from pandas DataFrame; reads inertia values for different k during the loop; reads silhouette score from sklearn.metrics",
  "sinks": "Uses clustering results to assign labels; outputs plots and printed cluster comparison; no untrusted input or data leaks observed",
  "flows": "Data loaded from sklearn.datasets to DataFrame; data standardized; inertia computed for each k; elbow point identified; KMeans model fitted; cluster labels assigned; visualization generated; cluster labels compared to true species; silhouette score calculated",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code. Usage of standard sklearn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and kneed libraries is typical for data analysis.",
  "analysis": "The script loads the Iris dataset, standardizes the features, computes inertia for k from 1 to 10 to find the optimal number of clusters via the elbow method using KneeLocator, then fits a KMeans model with the optimal k. It visualizes the clusters and compares them to actual species labels, also calculating the silhouette score to evaluate clustering quality. All operations are standard data analysis steps with no signs of malicious code, such as network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The code relies solely on open-source libraries and performs intended analysis tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard clustering analysis on a public dataset using common libraries, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a typical data science script for exploratory clustering analysis. No malware indicators or security risks are detected.",
