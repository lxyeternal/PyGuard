{
  "purpose": "This script performs data analysis and clustering on the Iris dataset, including visualization and evaluation of the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow and Silhouette methods.",
  "sources": "Loads the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets, reads dataset features, and uses libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn (KMeans, StandardScaler, silhouette_score), and kneed for elbow detection.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include print statements for cluster comparison, optimal k value, and silhouette score, as well as plots for clustering and elbow method. No untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading -> standardization -> clustering (KMeans) -> cluster label assignment -> visualization -> evaluation metrics. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of external libraries appears standard for data analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common data science libraries and performs standard clustering procedures on the Iris dataset. It calculates inertia across different k values, applies the KneeLocator to find the optimal number of clusters, and visualizes results. The use of 'kneed' for automatic elbow detection is appropriate and does not introduce malicious behavior. No parts of the code perform network operations, file access beyond standard dataset loading, or any suspicious activity. The code is well-structured for legitimate data analysis purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data analysis script for clustering with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It uses standard libraries and techniques to perform clustering and visualization on publicly available data. There are no security risks or malware indications.",
