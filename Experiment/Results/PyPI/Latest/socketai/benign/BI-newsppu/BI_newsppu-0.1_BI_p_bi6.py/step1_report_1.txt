{
  "purpose": "Perform K-Means clustering analysis on the Iris dataset, including optimal cluster determination and visualization.",
  "sources": "Libraries imported (pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn, kneed), dataset loading, inertia calculation, elbow method, silhouette score calculation.",
  "sinks": "Data visualization (scatter plots, elbow plot), print statements showing clustering results and metrics.",
  "flows": "Data loaded from sklearn datasets -> scaled -> inertia calculated for different k -> elbow method finds optimal k -> final clustering with optimal k -> visualization and metrics output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network operations detected. External libraries are standard and relevant for data analysis. No code execution, code injection, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard clustering analysis on the Iris dataset using widely accepted libraries. The 'kneed' library is used to identify the elbow point automatically, which is legitimate. No data leaks, network communications, or malicious code are present. The code strictly performs clustering and visualization without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of K-Means clustering with proper methods for optimal cluster determination and visualization. No malicious intent or security risks are identified.",
