{
  "purpose": "The code performs K-Means clustering analysis on the Iris dataset, including data loading, standardization, optimal cluster determination via elbow method and silhouette score, and visualization of results.",
  "sources": "The code reads dataset data from sklearn.datasets.load_iris(), and input data from the pandas DataFrame containing the Iris features.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs plots and prints results; no untrusted data is written to external systems or files, and there are no network transmissions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading to standardization, then to clustering, and finally to visualization and evaluation metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code uses established libraries and standard practices. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical machine learning workflow for clustering analysis using scikit-learn and visualization libraries. It loads a well-known dataset, processes it, determines optimal clustering parameters, and visualizes the results. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. All imported libraries are common in data science workflows. No data leaks or security risks are evident. The code executes standard clustering procedures without any unexpected or hidden code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate clustering analysis script without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe to use and contains no signs of malware or security risks.",
