{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform clustering analysis on the Iris dataset using the KMeans algorithm, determine the optimal number of clusters via the Elbow method and KneeLocator, and visualize the results.",
  "sources": "Data is loaded from the sklearn.datasets.load_iris function; input data is the Iris dataset features. No external untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs plots, console logs, and a DataFrame with cluster assignments; no data is written to external servers or files, and no untrusted sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset load to scaling, then into KMeans clustering, with cluster labels assigned back to the DataFrame. Visualizations and print statements display analysis results.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious external calls, or obfuscated code. Usage of external libraries (scikit-learn, seaborn, kneed) is typical for data analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data analysis and clustering procedures on a well-known dataset. The inclusion of the 'kneed' library for elbow point detection is legitimate. There are no indications of malicious behavior. Variables and functions are used conventionally. No suspicious code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign clustering analysis script for the Iris dataset, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard data science libraries and techniques without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
