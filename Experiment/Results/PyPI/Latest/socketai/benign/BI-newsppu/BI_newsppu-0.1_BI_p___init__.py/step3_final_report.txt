  "purpose": "Analysis of Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code features, anomalies, and potential threats.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, file I/O, dynamic imports, exec statements, network connections, logging, system commands.",
  "sinks": "Console output, network sockets, file writes, system commands, environment variables, logs.",
  "flows": "Input data from sources to sinks via processing functions, possibly involving dynamic code execution or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec(), dynamic imports, absence of code in some reports, lack of code obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code generally appears benign with no malicious payloads or obfuscation. Dynamic features like exec() and dynamic imports are flagged as risky but not inherently malicious; their presence warrants cautious scoring. Absence of code in some reports limits assessment, leading to low risk and malware scores. The scores across reports are consistent with the described features, with a slight adjustment recommended for Report 2 to reflect the inherent risk of dynamic code execution. Confidence levels are high where code is present and low where code is absent. No evidence of malicious intent or sabotage is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates benign code with low security risk. Dynamic features in Report 2 introduce some potential risk, warranting a marginal increase in malware score. All reports' scores are consistent with their descriptions, and no malicious activity is confirmed.",
