  "purpose": "Data analysis and modeling of Titanic dataset for survival prediction using logistic regression.",
  "sources": "Reading data from 'titanic.csv', importing libraries, accessing and manipulating DataFrame columns.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used in a way that affects system security or leaks sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Data is read from a CSV file, processed, and then used for model training and evaluation. No flow leads to external network or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is standard data analysis and modeling code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard data science libraries, reads a dataset, preprocesses data, trains a logistic regression model using grid search, and visualizes data and model performance. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior is detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. The code performs typical machine learning workflow without any obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical data analysis and predictive modeling workflow with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes the Titanic dataset for survival prediction using standard libraries and techniques.",
