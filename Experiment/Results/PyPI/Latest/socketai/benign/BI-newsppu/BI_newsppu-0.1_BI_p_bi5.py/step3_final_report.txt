  "purpose": "Standard data analysis and modeling pipeline for Titanic dataset, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads 'titanic.csv' from local disk; no external data sources or network activity.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include print statements, plots, and evaluation metrics; no data exfiltration or external system modifications.",
  "flows": "Reads CSV -> cleans and encodes data -> creates features -> scales data -> splits into train/test -> trains model -> predicts and evaluates -> generates plots",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data science tasks with no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns. It reads a local CSV, processes data, trains a logistic regression model with hyperparameter tuning, and visualizes results. No malicious or malicious-like behavior is evident. The security implications are minimal; the code does not exfiltrate data or modify system state. The scoring in the reports correctly reflects this benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data analysis script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
