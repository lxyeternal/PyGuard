{
  "purpose": "The code performs data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and visualization on the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'titanic.csv' file using pandas.read_csv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include print statements, plotting figures, and model evaluation metrics; no data is written or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded, processed, scaled, split, modeled, and visualized sequentially within the script; no external network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or hidden backdoors identified. Use of standard libraries and straightforward data processing steps.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a CSV file, performs typical data cleaning and encoding, applies a machine learning model, and generates visualizations for analysis. All steps are standard for data science workflows. No suspicious activity such as network calls, code injection, or malicious data handling is evident. No obfuscated code or abnormal behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data analysis and modeling script for Titanic dataset prediction tasks, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
