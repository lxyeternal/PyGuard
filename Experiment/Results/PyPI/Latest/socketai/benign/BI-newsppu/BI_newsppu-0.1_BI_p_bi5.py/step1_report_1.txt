  "purpose": "Data analysis and modeling of Titanic dataset for survival prediction, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Reading the dataset from 'titanic.csv'; importing external libraries.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data influences system or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "Data is read from 'titanic.csv' and processed; model predictions and visualizations are generated within the code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code mainly performs standard data science tasks without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a CSV dataset, performs typical preprocessing (dropping features, filling missing values, encoding categorical variables), scales features, splits data, trains a logistic regression model with hyperparameter tuning, and evaluates it. It generates several visualizations for exploratory data analysis. All operations are standard for a data science workflow. There are no indications of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code does not interact with the network, filesystem in an unusual manner, or handle sensitive data insecurely beyond reading a CSV file. The functions and flow are typical, and the code appears to serve an analytical purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard data analysis and modeling script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs common data science operations and visualizations. There are no anomalies indicating sabotage or malware.",
