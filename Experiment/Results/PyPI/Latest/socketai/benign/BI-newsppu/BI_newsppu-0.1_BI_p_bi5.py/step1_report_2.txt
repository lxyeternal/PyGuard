  "purpose": "Data analysis and predictive modeling of Titanic passenger survival using logistic regression.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV file 'titanic.csv' for dataset input.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or sensitive information exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Reads data from CSV -> preprocesses and encodes data -> trains model -> evaluates model -> generates visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or unusual code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data science procedures: data loading, cleaning, encoding, feature engineering, scaling, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and visualization. No suspicious patterns, hidden code, or malicious behaviors are evident. All external data interactions are limited to reading a CSV file; no network or system modifications are present. The code’s structure and logic align with common machine learning workflows without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a typical, legitimate data analysis pipeline with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It reads data from a local file, processes it, trains and evaluates a logistic regression model, and produces visualizations for insights. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration.",
