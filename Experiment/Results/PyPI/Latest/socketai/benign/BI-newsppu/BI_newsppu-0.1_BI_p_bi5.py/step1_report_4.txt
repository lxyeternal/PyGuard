  "purpose": "This code performs data analysis and modeling on the Titanic dataset, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'titanic.csv' using pd.read_csv.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs model evaluation metrics, plots, and displays data summaries; it does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'titanic.csv' flows into preprocessing steps; processed data flows into model training and evaluation; model outputs and visualizations are generated locally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses common libraries and standard practices without unusual or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a CSV file for data analysis, preprocesses data (including handling missing values and encoding), trains a logistic regression model with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV, evaluates the model, and produces various plots for data insights. All operations are typical for a data science pipeline and involve no external communication, system manipulation, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard data analysis and machine learning pipeline without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs data loading, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization using common libraries and methods. No signs of malware or security risks are detected.",
