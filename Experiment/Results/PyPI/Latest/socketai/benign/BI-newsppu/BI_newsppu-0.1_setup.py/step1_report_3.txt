  "purpose": "To configure and package a Python educational library related to BI code examples.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs, no user input handling, no environment variables read.",
  "sinks": "No sensitive data output, no network connections, no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only sets up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of standard setup configuration with no suspicious parameters, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No code executes external commands, handles input, or contains obfuscated or suspicious code. The dependencies are common scientific Python libraries. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
