  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or external code execution is mentioned.\n- The dependencies are common data science libraries.\n- The URL is a placeholder, which is typical during development, not malicious.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or network activity are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code is straightforward and aligns with typical Python packaging practices. No issues or anomalies are detected.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports note no obfuscation, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk:** Given the benign nature, all reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Issue Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports give a `malware` score of 0, `obfuscated` of 0, and `securityRisk` of 0, which is consistent and justified.\n- **Confidence:** All reports have a confidence of 1, which is reasonable given the clear, standard code.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n\n- The only minor point is the placeholder URL, but this is common during development and not malicious.\n- No indication of supply chain attack vectors, malicious dependencies, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional comments:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                               |\n|--------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0      | No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      | Clear, standard code with no obfuscation.                     |\n| Security Risk      | 0      | No vulnerabilities, secrets, or external threats identified. |\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The package setup code is safe, benign, and aligns with standard practices. No further action needed.",
