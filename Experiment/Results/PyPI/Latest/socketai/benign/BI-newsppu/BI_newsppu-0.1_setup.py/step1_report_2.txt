  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'BI_newsppu' containing educational BI code examples.",
  "sources": "User input for package metadata, dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; straightforward setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. All fields appear standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. All dependencies are standard Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning. The URL field is a placeholder, which is not suspicious but should be updated. No suspicious patterns or anomalies identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate, standard setup configuration for a Python educational package. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
