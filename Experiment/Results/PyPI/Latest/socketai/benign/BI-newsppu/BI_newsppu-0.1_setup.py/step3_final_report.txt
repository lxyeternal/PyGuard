  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading package name, version, author info, description, URL, dependencies, classifiers, and Python version requirements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input sources; static configuration data only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools to specify package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious constructs. All dependencies are common data science libraries. The URL is a placeholder, typical during development. Multiple expert reviews confirm the absence of malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
