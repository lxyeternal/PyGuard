  "purpose": "Perform clustering analysis on the Iris dataset and visualize the results.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pandas, matplotlib, sklearn libraries, loading Iris dataset, reading data from sklearn datasets.",
  "sinks": "Plotting functions (matplotlib, seaborn) display data visualizations; print statements output data summaries.",
  "flows": "Data loaded from sklearn datasets -> stored in pandas DataFrame -> standardized with StandardScaler -> clustered with KMeans -> cluster labels added to DataFrame -> visualized with seaborn and matplotlib.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior; standard data analysis and visualization procedures. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical machine learning tasks: data loading, standardization, clustering, and visualization. All libraries are well-known for data analysis purposes. No malicious or suspicious activities detected. No untrusted inputs or network communications are present. The flow of data is straightforward and conventional for this kind of analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data analysis script for clustering the Iris dataset. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or signs of sabotage detected.",
