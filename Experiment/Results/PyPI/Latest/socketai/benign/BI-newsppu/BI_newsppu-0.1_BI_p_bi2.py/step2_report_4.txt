  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, malware, obfuscation, and risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as standard data analysis using well-known libraries and datasets.\n- No external or untrusted data sources are used.\n- No network activity, file manipulations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code segments.\n- The code performs clustering and visualization, which are common tasks.\n\n**Malware assessment:**\n\n- The code does not contain any malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The use of standard libraries and datasets further reduces suspicion.\n- No claims or evidence of malicious intent or payloads.\n\n**Obfuscation assessment:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, readable, and uses standard syntax.\n- No obfuscated or encrypted code segments are present.\n\n**Risk score assessment:**\n\n- Given the above, the overall security risk appears minimal, with no signs of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- The highest risk score should be close to 0, reflecting benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific score justifications:\n\n**Malware score: 0**\n\n- No malicious behavior or code is present.\n- All reports agree on benign analysis.\n\n**Obfuscated score: 0**\n\n- Clear, standard code with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score: 0**\n\n- No security risks, vulnerabilities, or suspicious flows are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0** |\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign data analysis script.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain at zero for all categories.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent with this assessment. No changes are necessary.",
