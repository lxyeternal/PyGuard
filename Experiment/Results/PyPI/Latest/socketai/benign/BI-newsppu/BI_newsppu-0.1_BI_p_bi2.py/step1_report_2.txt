{
  "purpose": "The code loads the Iris dataset, performs standardization, applies K-Means clustering, and visualizes the resulting clusters along with a comparison to actual species labels.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the sklearn.datasets.load_iris() function; no external or untrusted input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Data is printed to the console, visualized using matplotlib and seaborn; no sinks for untrusted data or sensitive information are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading into dataframes, through processing and clustering, into visualization functions, and finally to printed output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The code performs standard machine learning and visualization tasks without obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common data science libraries, loads a standard dataset, performs typical preprocessing (scaling), runs clustering, and visualizes results. All operations are typical for an ML pipeline; no suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious commands are present. No code injection, environment variable misuse, or unsafe SQL is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward machine learning analysis script for the Iris dataset with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It uses standard libraries and functions for data analysis and visualization, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
