{
  "purpose": "The code loads the Iris dataset, performs K-Means clustering, and visualizes the results, likely for data analysis or educational purposes.",
  "sources": "Data is loaded from sklearn.datasets.load_iris(), which is a static dataset; no external input sources or untrusted data inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn, and prints a DataFrame comparison. No data is written to network, files, or external systems; no sinks for untrusted data are detected.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the dataset load through processing and clustering, then to visualization and print output. There are no flows involving untrusted external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behaviors. The code performs standard data analysis tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing standard data science libraries and loading a well-known public dataset. It standardizes data and applies K-Means clustering, both common procedures. Visualization and printing results are typical steps for exploratory data analysis. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No external network communications, file manipulations, or sensitive data handling are present. The code is straightforward and intended for analysis or educational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical example of data analysis using publicly available datasets and standard libraries. There is no malicious intent or security risks detected. The code is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscated sections.",
