{
  "purpose": "The code performs data analysis and visualization on the Iris dataset using clustering techniques, specifically applying KMeans clustering and plotting the results.",
  "sources": "The code loads the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets, standardizes the data with StandardScaler, and reads no external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a scatter plot and prints dataframes, which do not handle untrusted data or cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading to preprocessing, clustering, and visualization, all using trusted, predefined data; no untrusted source-to-sink flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are observed. The code uses standard libraries and functions as intended for data analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code loads the Iris dataset, standardizes it, applies KMeans clustering, and visualizes the results. All operations utilize common, open-source Python libraries for data science. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated sections, or suspicious behaviors. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are processed. The code performs typical machine learning workflows without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data analysis script using established libraries with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely for data clustering and visualization.",
