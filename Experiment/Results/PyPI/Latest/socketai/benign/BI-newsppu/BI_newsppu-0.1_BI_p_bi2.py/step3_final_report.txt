{
  "purpose": "The code performs data analysis and visualization on the Iris dataset using standard machine learning libraries, with no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "sources": "The code reads the static Iris dataset loaded via sklearn's load_iris() function.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn, and prints a comparison DataFrame; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the load_iris() dataset into pandas DataFrame, then through standardization, clustering, and visualization steps; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of clustering and visualization on a static dataset, using trusted libraries with no network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted inputs. It performs standard data science tasks with clear, readable code. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard data analysis tasks, and contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as 0, aligning with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
