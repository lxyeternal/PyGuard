{
  "purpose": "This code performs data analysis and visualization by clustering the Iris dataset using KMeans and visualizing the results.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the sklearn.datasets.load_iris function, which loads the Iris dataset into memory.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs plots via matplotlib and seaborn, and prints to the console. No untrusted data is written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Data from load_iris is loaded into memory, then processed with StandardScaler, then clustered with KMeans. The cluster labels are added to the dataset, and visualizations are generated based on the processed data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard libraries and functions for data analysis and visualization. There are no hardcoded secrets, network communications, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a well-known dataset from sklearn, standardizes it, applies clustering, and visualizes the results. All steps involve local processing and visualization. There are no suspicious or malicious operations, no external communications, and no obfuscated or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a typical data analysis script.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign data analysis and visualization tool utilizing standard machine learning and plotting libraries. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
