  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, potentially for data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose is unclear due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Input data could originate from environment variables, function parameters, or external files (though none are explicitly shown). No explicit input sources are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network calls, file writes, or execution functions if present, but none are visible in the snippet. Without explicit I/O operations, no direct sinks are identifiable.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within the provided code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code structures, or unusual behaviors are evident. The code uses standard constructs without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment is minimal and does not contain functions, input/output operations, or any suspicious constructs. The lack of context limits detection of malicious intent, but based on the visible content, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the given code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security issues. The code appears benign, though the limited context restricts a comprehensive assessment.",
