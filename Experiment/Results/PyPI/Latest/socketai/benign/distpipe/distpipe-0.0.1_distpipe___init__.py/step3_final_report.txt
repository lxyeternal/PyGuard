{
  "purpose": "The code performs routine data processing and network communication without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, function parameters, network responses, or file inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, console output, or data storage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs) through functions and processing steps, with no suspicious untrusted data handling identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected; code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and lacks indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. No suspicious data flows or hardcoded credentials are present. The network operations are typical and do not suggest malicious intent. The overall structure and behavior align with benign routines, and the absence of anomalies supports a low threat profile.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is effectively zero. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the provided analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
