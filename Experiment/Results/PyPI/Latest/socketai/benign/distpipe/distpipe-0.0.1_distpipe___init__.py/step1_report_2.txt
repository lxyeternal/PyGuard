  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some operation that requires reading input data, possibly processing or transmitting it.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from user input, environment variables, or external files. Specific input sources are not explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Data may be sent over network connections, written to files, or processed in sensitive functions such as database queries or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to sinks potentially via intermediate processing functions, which could introduce security risks if not properly validated.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are detected. The code structure appears straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "A step-by-step review shows that the code performs standard operations: importing libraries, reading input, performing computations, and possibly outputting results. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network connections to suspicious domains, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Usage of third-party libraries appears normal. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The code does not invoke dangerous functions or execute untrusted input unsafely.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious behavior. It appears to be a typical Python script performing legitimate operations without security risks. The overall security risk is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
