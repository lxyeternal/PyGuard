      "conclusion": "The code is insecure due to unsafe deserialization of untrusted data via pickle, which can lead to remote code execution. While the code is not malicious per se, its unsafe pattern poses a high security risk. The scores should reflect this high risk, with malware potential at approximately 0.75 and overall security risk at 0.75. The use of pickle in this context is a critical vulnerability that should be addressed by replacing it with safer serialization methods or adding validation measures."

The main concern is the abrupt shutdown behavior, which could be improved for graceful termination but does not constitute malicious intent."
