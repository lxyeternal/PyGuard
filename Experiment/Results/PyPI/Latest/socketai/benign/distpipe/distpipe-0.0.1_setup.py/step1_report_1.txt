  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration script for packaging the 'distpipe' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; static metadata fields like name, version, author, etc.",
  "targets": "No untrusted input or data flow; no sinks that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from sources to sinks; static setup configuration with no user input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated parts, or hidden behaviors; straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code simply reads a markdown file for description and calls setuptools.setup() with static package metadata. No user input, no network connections, and no code execution beyond package configuration. All data is hardcoded or file-based, with no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python packaging configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
