  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'distpipe' Python package, including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; package discovery via setuptools.find_packages().",
  "sinks": "None present; no handling of untrusted data or external inputs during runtime.",
  "flows": "Reading README file -> package setup parameters -> package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets detected. The code uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup, reads a README.md file for the long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with standard package metadata and configuration. There are no dynamic code executions, no network operations, or handling of sensitive data. All elements follow typical Python packaging practices without signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, supply chain security risks, or obfuscation. It simply prepares package metadata for distribution.",
