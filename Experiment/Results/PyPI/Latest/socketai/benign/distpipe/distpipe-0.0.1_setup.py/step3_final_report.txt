  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for distributing a project named 'distpipe'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; static code with no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Reading static file -> calling setuptools.setup() with static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads a markdown file for description and invokes setuptools.setup() with fixed parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent and justified given the code's simplicity and static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Python packaging script with no malicious intent or security issues. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
