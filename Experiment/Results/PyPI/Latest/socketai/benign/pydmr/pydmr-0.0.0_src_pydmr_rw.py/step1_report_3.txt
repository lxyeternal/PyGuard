{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to write and read a custom .dmr file format, involving data serialization/deserialization of structured experimental data, parameters, ROIs, and standard deviations.",
  "sources": "Input sources include file paths provided to write/read functions, and CSV/zip file contents during reading. Data is read from CSV files within a ZIP archive.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing CSV files, creating ZIP archives, and writing data to disk. No unsafe data handling or external network calls are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into internal data structures; during read, from CSV contents into dictionaries; during write, from data structures into CSV files and ZIP archive. No external untrusted data flows to system commands or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are evident. The code primarily performs data validation, serialization, and file I/O without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly validates data schemas, types, and consistency before writing files. The read function carefully parses CSV contents, enforcing data types and consistency checks. Functions for nested/dictionary conversions are straightforward. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or network activity. The only potential concern is the creation and deletion of directories and ZIP files, but these are standard for file packaging processes. No suspicious or malicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation for managing a specific file format for experimental data. No malicious intent, backdoors, or malware are identified. It performs data validation and file handling without unsafe operations.",
