  "conclusion": "The code is benign with respect to malicious activity; the main concern is the trustworthiness of the third-party 'pydmr' package and the use of 'import *'. The scores are appropriate, with a slight increase in risk due to potential obscured malicious code within the dependency. No active malicious behavior is detected."
