{
  "purpose": "Import functions and classes from the 'pydmr' library, specifically 'rw' and all its contents.",
  "sources": "Import statements at the beginning of the code, which load modules from the external 'pydmr' package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to the import process; no runtime data flow from source to sink is present in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any suspicious or unusual constructs. The use of 'import *' can sometimes obscure imported content, but on its own, it is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports the 'rw' module from 'pydmr' and then imports all its contents. There are no function calls, data processing, or network operations shown. Without further code, there are no signs of malicious behavior. The use of 'import *' could be considered poor practice but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a basic import statement with no harmful actions visible.",
