  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, straightforward implementation of GitLab file operations. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
