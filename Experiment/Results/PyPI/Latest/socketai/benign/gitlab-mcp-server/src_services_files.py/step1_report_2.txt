  "purpose": "Service functions for interacting with GitLab repository files via REST API, including get, create, update, and delete operations.",
  "sources": "Input models (GetFileContentsInput, CreateFileInput, UpdateFileInput, DeleteFileInput) providing project path, file path, branch, content, commit messages, etc.",
  "sinks": "API calls to gitlab_rest_client methods (get_async, post_async, put_async, delete_async) that send requests to the GitLab API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input models are processed to encode project and file paths, then used to construct API request endpoints and payloads. API responses (base64 content) are decoded and returned. Errors are caught and raised as custom exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Use of base64 decoding of API responses is standard for GitLab API. No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code securely interacts with the GitLab API to manage repository files. It validates required inputs before API calls, encodes paths properly, and handles various error scenarios by raising specific exceptions. The API responses are decoded correctly. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The functions perform expected file operations without suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and implements legitimate file management operations with appropriate error handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code fragment.",
