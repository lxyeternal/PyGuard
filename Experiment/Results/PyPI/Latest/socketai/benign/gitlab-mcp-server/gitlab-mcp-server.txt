      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "All reports are generally accurate; however, report 2's malware score should be increased from 0 to approximately 0.6 due to the described suspicious pattern involving eval/exec with untrusted input. Other scores are consistent with the evidence, and the overall security assessment remains low to moderate, with specific attention needed for potential unsafe functions."

The security risk is minimal, primarily due to standard API interaction practices, and the malware score is zero. The overall assessment confirms a high-security posture."

The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure API wrapper for fetching GitLab CI/CD job logs. It employs proper error handling and URL encoding, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external API interaction, but this is standard practice. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting low but non-zero risk due to external dependencies."

The low security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate given external API dependencies but does not indicate any immediate threat."
