  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, external modules, network operations, data processing points.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, environment variables, code execution points, data outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources to processing functions, then to sinks such as network or file systems, potentially untrusted data paths.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic execution, obfuscated variable names, high obfuscation scores, minimal or obfuscated code, lack of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate low likelihood of malicious activity, with scores reflecting cautious suspicion mainly due to obfuscation or minimal code. Confidence levels are high where code is clear, moderate where obfuscation or minimal code is present. Malware scores are consistently low (0–0.1), matching the absence of concrete malicious indicators. Obfuscation scores are higher where code is obfuscated or minimal, justified by the description. Security risks are low (0.2), aligning with the lack of suspicious patterns. The scores are internally consistent and justified by the detailed reasoning in each report.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates minimal to no malicious activity in the analyzed code snippets. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the observations. No significant adjustments are necessary unless further code or context reveals malicious behavior.",
