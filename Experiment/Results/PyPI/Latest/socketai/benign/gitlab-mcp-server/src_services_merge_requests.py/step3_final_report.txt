  "purpose": "Provides a set of functions for managing GitLab merge requests, including creation, listing, retrieval, updating, deletion, comments, discussions, suggestions, and merging.",
  "sources": "User inputs such as project_path, merge request IDs, comment bodies, suggestion IDs, and data from API responses.",
  "sinks": "API requests to GitLab endpoints, response handling, and response validation.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into API payloads and URL parameters; responses are validated and returned as model instances.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious control flow detected. Data handling is standard for API wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client for GitLab merge request operations, with proper encoding, error handling, and response validation. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage. The logic is standard, and data flows are typical for such API wrappers. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The minimal security risk score reflects the fact that user input is directly sent to external APIs, which is normal for such code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for managing GitLab merge requests. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are accurate and appropriate.",
