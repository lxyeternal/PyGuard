  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure API wrapper for fetching GitLab CI/CD job logs. It employs proper error handling and URL encoding, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external API interaction, but this is standard practice. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting low but non-zero risk due to external dependencies."
