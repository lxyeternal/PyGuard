  "purpose": "Provide functions to retrieve GitLab CI/CD job logs via REST API calls.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'input_model' (project_path, job_id); accesses 'gitlab_rest_client' for API requests.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'gitlab_rest_client.get_async' to perform HTTP GET request with encoded project path and job ID.",
  "flows": "Input data (project_path, job_id) -> encoding via '_encode_path_parameter' -> API request via 'get_async' -> response returned as JobLogsResponse.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code. No unusual or hidden behaviors detected. The API call is standard. Exception handling re-raises specific exceptions with contextual info.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly retrieves job logs from a GitLab API client. It encodes the project path before making an asynchronous GET request. Error handling wraps exceptions into a custom error with contextual info. No untrusted input appears to be used in unsafe ways, nor are there signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The functions are straightforward, using provided models and a REST client, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a GitLab CI/CD log retrieval function, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly handles exceptions and performs safe API requests.",
