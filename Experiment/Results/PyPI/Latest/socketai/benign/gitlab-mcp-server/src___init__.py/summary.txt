  "conclusion": "All reports are generally accurate; however, report 2's malware score should be increased from 0 to approximately 0.6 due to the described suspicious pattern involving eval/exec with untrusted input. Other scores are consistent with the evidence, and the overall security assessment remains low to moderate, with specific attention needed for potential unsafe functions."
