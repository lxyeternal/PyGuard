  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task or functionality, but without seeing the code itself, the exact intent cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from environment variables, user inputs, or external files (specific sources cannot be identified without the code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, writing to system files, executing commands, or handling sensitive data, but specifics are unavailable without code details.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through function calls or data processing routines, but exact paths cannot be traced without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without examining the code. Need to check for hardcoded secrets, suspicious functions, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "Due to absence of the code snippet, a thorough step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Normally, this would include examining code for suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, dangerous function calls, or obfuscation. Without code, only a generic assessment is possible.",
