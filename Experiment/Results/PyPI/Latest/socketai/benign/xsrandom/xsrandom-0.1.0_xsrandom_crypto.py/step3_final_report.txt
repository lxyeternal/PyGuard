  "purpose": "Cryptographic utility functions for secure random data generation, hashing, UUIDs, token creation, and related cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Standard Python modules (_secrets, uuid, hashlib, hmac, base64, string) and internal functions for randomness and encoding.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic functions, encoding outputs, JWT token signing, fingerprint generation, and data formatting; no external data leaks or untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Secure random data generated by _secrets or internal functions flows into hashing, encoding, UUID, and token functions; JWT creation involves internal data and optional external secret keys; no external data sources or leaks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscation; external secret key in jwt_token is generated securely if not provided, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cryptographic libraries and practices, generating secure random data, hashes, UUIDs, and tokens. No external data sources or leaks are present. The jwt_token function optionally accepts an external secret key, but defaults to securely generated data. All functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The use of secure modules and proper encoding indicates a well-implemented cryptographic utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure cryptographic utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score reflects the typical considerations around external secret handling in JWTs, which is standard practice. Overall, the code is safe and well-implemented.",
