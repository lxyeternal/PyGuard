  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's functions and dependencies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; data flows are from secure generators into cryptographic functions, with no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns. The use of external modules like `.core` is noted, but presumed safe.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report rightly identifies the code as secure, with no malicious intent. The optional external secret in `jwt_token` is standard practice, not a vulnerability.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (reasonable, given the optional external secret)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Overall, the scoring aligns with the findings.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; the code relies on secure modules, no external untrusted data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly described; data flows are secure, with no external leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly states that the code uses standard cryptographic practices and is free from malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 (low, given the secure design)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; uses secure sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is secure, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (reasonable)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** The evaluation is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; relies on secure modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper; no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately identifies the code as secure and standard.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (reasonable)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; standard cryptographic sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; no external leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is a legitimate cryptographic utility with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0 (correct, given the code's nature)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** The report is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is justified given the code clarity.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable considering the optional external secret key in `jwt_token`, but overall, the code appears secure.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to the optional external secret key which could be misused if improperly handled but is standard practice.\n\n**Note:** The code appears well-implemented, using standard cryptographic libraries, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores, and I would maintain the overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code is secure, clear, and free from malicious intent.",
