  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured geographic data generator with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0–0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior. Overall, it is safe for use, with minimal inherent security risk due to randomness, which is typical for such utilities."
