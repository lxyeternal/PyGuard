{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for generating random geographical data such as coordinates, altitude, country codes, city names, and other location-related information.",
  "sources": "Uses imported functions: random(), uniform(), randint(), choice(), normal(); Reads no external inputs other than function arguments; Reads constants such as country codes and city lists.",
  "sinks": "Returns generated data; no external sinks involved; no network or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal data sources (lists, constants) and random functions to return values; no flow from untrusted external input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; no code injection, data leakage, or insecure handling observed; code appears straightforward in purpose. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for generating random geographic and location data using standard Python libraries and in-code lists. It relies solely on well-understood random functions and predefined static data. The functions include coordinate generation, country and city name selection, postal code creation, and distance calculations. There are no external inputs that could be maliciously manipulated, and no data is transmitted or used insecurely. The code is structured clearly with appropriate validation and error handling. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for generating random geographic data. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe for use within applications that need synthetic geographic data.",
