  "purpose": "Functions for generating random geographic data such as latitude, longitude, coordinates, altitude, and related information for simulation or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Standard Python random functions (random(), randint(), choice(), uniform(), normal()), static lists of country codes, city names, place types, etc.",
  "sinks": "No external data inputs, network communication, or data leaks; all data is generated internally.",
  "flows": "Input sources (random number generators, static lists) flow into data generation functions which produce geographic data outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions for geographic data generation, relying on standard libraries and static data. Validation checks are in place for coordinate ranges. No external inputs or network activity are present. The functions use common mathematical formulas and randomization methods typical for such utilities. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of randomness and normal distribution in altitude is standard and not malicious. The code is well-structured, clear, and intended solely for data simulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured geographic data generator with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0–0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior. Overall, it is safe for use, with minimal inherent security risk due to randomness, which is typical for such utilities.",
