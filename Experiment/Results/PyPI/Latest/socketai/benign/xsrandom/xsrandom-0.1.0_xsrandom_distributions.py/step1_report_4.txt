{
  "purpose": "The code provides a collection of functions to generate random values following various statistical distributions, intended for use in simulations or probabilistic modeling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments (e.g., distribution parameters), and uses the 'random()' function imported from a local module. It also generates random numbers via numpy's functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe functions include 'custom_distribution' which can generate arbitrary data; 'multivariate_normal' which manipulates covariance matrices; and 'weighted_choice' which processes weights for random selection. The code may leak data if external 'random()' or distribution parameters are influenced externally, especially in 'custom_distribution'.",
  "flows": "Sources include function parameters and 'random()' calls. Data flows into distribution calculations, mathematical functions, and random sampling methods. Untrusted data (e.g., distribution parameters) could influence outcomes if externally manipulated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. The code uses standard random distribution algorithms with no obfuscated or misleading code structures. No malicious system calls or network operations are present. All functions appear standard for statistical sampling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of statistical distribution generators, utilizing standard Python math, numpy, and custom 'random()' source. It employs proper validation for distribution parameters. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are present. The function 'custom_distribution' may be exploited to generate arbitrary data if 'pdf_function' is malicious, but this is a normal pattern for customizable sampling. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious intents are evident. The code appears well-structured for statistical purposes without obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate collection of random distribution functions with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It could be misused if external functions like 'pdf_function' in 'custom_distribution' are malicious, but this is a normal and expected use case. No malware or malicious behavior is detected.",
