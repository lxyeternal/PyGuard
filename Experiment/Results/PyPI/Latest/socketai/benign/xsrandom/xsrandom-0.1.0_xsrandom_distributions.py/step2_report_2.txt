  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard implementation of statistical distribution functions.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The functions validate parameters properly.\n- The use of `random()` from a local module could be a concern if that module is compromised, but in the context of these reports, no evidence suggests malicious control.\n- The `custom_distribution()` function employs rejection sampling, which is common, but could be misused if `pdf_function` is malicious. However, this is a normal pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- The code does not contain network operations, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues:\n- **Code correctness:** No issues are detected in the code logic; all implementations match standard formulas.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, sabotage, or backdoors.\n- **Parameter validation:** Properly handled.\n- **Potential concerns:** The only minor point is the source of `random()` (imported from `.core`), which could be controlled externally if the module is compromised, but this is not evidenced here.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with clear code.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero potential risk, mainly due to the use of external randomness sources and `custom_distribution`.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- The overall low scores are justified given the benign nature of the code.\n- Slightly higher risk (0.2) in some reports accounts for the potential misuse of `custom_distribution()` or reliance on the external `random()` source.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as standard and safe.\n- No report suggests any assumptions about vulnerabilities that are unfounded.\n- The use of numpy's random functions is standard and safe in this context.\n- The `custom_distribution()` function, while flexible, is a common technique and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code appears legitimate, with no malicious intent or sabotage. The minor concerns about the randomness source are typical in such utility modules and do not indicate malicious behavior.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to potential misuse of flexible functions, but no actual malicious activity)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, well-implemented set of statistical distribution functions with proper validation and no signs of malicious behavior. The low risk score is justified, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, and the scores reflect its benign nature.",
