{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for generating random values with various statistical distributions, relying on internal and external sources of randomness.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters; uses 'random()' from a local module, and 'uniform()', 'choices()', 'randint()' from the same module; utilizes numpy's random functions for some distributions.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks or network activity; generates random data internally for statistical sampling.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (parameters, 'random()') influence the distribution calculations; no external data flows or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'random()' from a local module could be a concern if that module is compromised, but no malicious patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard statistical distribution functions with proper parameter validation. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected. The reliance on 'random()' from a local module is noted but not inherently malicious. The rejection sampling in 'custom_distribution()' is a common technique. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of statistical distribution functions with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The low security risk score is justified, primarily due to reliance on an external 'random()' source, but no malicious intent is detected. The code is safe for use in open-source projects, assuming the 'random()' function from the local module is trustworthy.",
