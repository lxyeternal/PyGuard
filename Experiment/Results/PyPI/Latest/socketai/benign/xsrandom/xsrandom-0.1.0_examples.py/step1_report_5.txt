{
  "purpose": "The script demonstrates usage examples for the 'xsrandom' library, showcasing various random data generation functions across multiple domains.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from user-defined functions, library functions (e.g., seed, rand, choice), and input parameters provided within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console via print statements; no data is sent over the network, written to files, or stored persistently. No untrusted data sources are used.",
  "flows": "The script initializes the random seed, then calls 'xsrandom' functions to generate and print random data across different categories, with no external data flows or untrusted inputs leading to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The functions appear to perform standard random data generation. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or unusual dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, calling library functions for various random data types and distributions, then printing the results. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or harmful operations. The use of 'xsrandom' functions seems legitimate and intended for generating sample data. No network activity, system modifications, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a comprehensive demonstration of the 'xsrandom' library's capabilities. It contains no malicious intent, suspicious patterns, or security risks. It appears safe and purely educational in nature.",
