{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate various features and usage examples of the xsrandom library, including random number generation, string creation, distribution sampling, date/time generation, cryptographic functions, geographic data, sequence operations, and performance testing.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (time), functions calling xsrandom methods with fixed parameters or random seeds",
  "sinks": "Print statements for output, calls to xsrandom functions that generate data (e.g., token_bytes, uuid, random_ip, etc.)",
  "flows": "Calls to xsrandom functions generate data, which is immediately printed to the console; no data is transmitted over networks or stored persistently within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected. All functions appear to be legitimate examples of xsrandom usage. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports xsrandom and time, then defines multiple functions demonstrating various features of xsrandom, including basic number generation, string manipulation, distribution sampling, date/time creation, cryptographic operations, geographic data, sequence handling, and performance testing. The functions rely on standard xsrandom methods with fixed parameters or random seed initialization, and their output is printed to the console. The main() function calls all these demonstrations sequentially, ensuring that no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. There are no indications of data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code appears purely educational and demonstrative.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of usage examples for the xsrandom library, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It simply demonstrates functionality without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
