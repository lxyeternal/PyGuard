{
  "purpose": "Demonstration of various features of the xsrandom library, including random number generation, string creation, distribution sampling, date/time, cryptography, geo-data, sequences, and performance testing.",
  "sources": "Internal function calls within xsrandom; no external data inputs or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Print statements displaying generated data; no external data transmission or storage.",
  "flows": "Function calls generate data which is directly printed; no external data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of demonstration functions for the xsrandom library, utilizing only internal data generation functions and printing their outputs. There are no external inputs, network activity, or data exfiltration. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The code's purpose is educational, and it does not perform any malicious or security-compromising operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for demonstration of the xsrandom library's features. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
