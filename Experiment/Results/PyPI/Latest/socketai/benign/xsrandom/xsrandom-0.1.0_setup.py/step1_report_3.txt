{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'xsrandom' Python package for distribution, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; package discovery via find_packages(); static assignment of package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no handling of untrusted data or outputting sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> storing in long_description; static configuration data used directly in setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. All code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical package setup: reads a README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns, and no external data handling or network activity. Use of static strings and standard library functions indicates typical build configuration. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It solely prepares the package for distribution.",
