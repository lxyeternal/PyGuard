  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, reading README.md for description, specifying metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file; static package metadata and dependencies",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs",
  "flows": "Reading file content into long_description; static configuration without dynamic or external data flows",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It reads a README.md file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input is present. All provided reports concur that the script is benign, with high confidence scores (1.0). No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The dependencies are common, and the code structure is standard. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard Python packaging configuration with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. All evidence and reports support a safe assessment, and no adjustments are necessary.",
