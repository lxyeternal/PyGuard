  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'xsrandom' Python library, including reading README.md for long description and specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, defining package metadata and dependencies",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content, passing parameters to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: reading a documentation file, defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are typical for a Python setup script. No untrusted input handling, no network activity, no code injection, and no suspicious code flows. The dependencies are straightforward, and no obfuscation or hidden behavior is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
