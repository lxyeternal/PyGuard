  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating random dates, times, and related data for testing or simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as start/end dates, times, timestamps, and other date/time components; internal use of standard libraries and a local '.core' module for randomness.",
  "sinks": "None; functions generate data locally without external communication or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are parsed and validated, then used to compute random date/time values within specified ranges.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard parsing and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for generating random date, time, datetime, timestamp, and related data. It uses standard libraries and a local '.core' module for randomness. All functions perform input validation, handle string parsing, and generate data within specified ranges. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious logic are present. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The minimal security risk scores (0.1) in some reports are justified by the potential for misuse of generated data but do not indicate vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for random date/time data generation. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
