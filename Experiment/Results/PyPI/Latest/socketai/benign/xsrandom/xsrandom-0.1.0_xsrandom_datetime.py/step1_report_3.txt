{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to generate random dates, times, date ranges, and related temporal data for testing or simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "Functions read input parameters such as start/end dates, times, date ranges, holiday lists, and optional locale or format settings.",
  "sinks": "Most functions generate and return data; no direct untrusted data sinks or sensitive data handling observed. No external network calls, file access, or environment variable usage is present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) flow through parsing and validation steps, leading to random number generation (sinks), resulting in date/time outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. Usage of random functions appears straightforward for data generation. No obfuscation, code injection, or misleading variable names are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple functions to generate random temporal data within specified ranges. It uses standard libraries (_datetime, _time, _calendar) and a local 'randint', 'random', 'choices' functions from '.core'. No external network calls, file system access, or environment variable manipulations are present. The functions handle input parsing, validation, and date calculations correctly, with appropriate error handling for invalid ranges. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication. No indications of obfuscation or malicious behavior are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for generating random date/time data without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The overall security risk score is low.",
