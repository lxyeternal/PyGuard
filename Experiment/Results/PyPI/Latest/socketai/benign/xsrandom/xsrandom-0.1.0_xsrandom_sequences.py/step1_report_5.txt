{
  "purpose": "Provides various random and combinatorial functions for generating permutations, combinations, sequences, and Markov chains.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function parameters, internal list conversions, and the imported 'random' functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'choices', 'sample', 'shuffle', and 'randint' which could process untrusted input if parameters are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (iterables, numbers) flow into functions, which generate random outputs or sequences based on these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Uses standard library functions for randomness. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. All code appears typical for a random utility library.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions related to random and combinatorial generation, including permutations, combinations, random walks, Markov sequences, and partitioning. All functions perform standard operations with input validation and use the imported 'random' module or math functions. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The functions do not execute untrusted code nor connect to external systems. They perform in-memory computations and data manipulations with no suspicious side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of random and combinatorial utilities with proper input validation. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use in generating random sequences or combinatorial data.",
