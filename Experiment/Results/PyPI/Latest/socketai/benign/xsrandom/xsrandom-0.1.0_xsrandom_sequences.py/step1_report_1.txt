{
  "purpose": "The code provides various randomization and combinatorial functions such as permutations, combinations, random walks, Markov sequences, and partitioning of integers, intended for use in probabilistic simulations or stochastic processes.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, including iterables, numerical values, and state lists. The only data reading operations are parameter inputs, no external data sources or user input functions are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit data sinks or network communication. No writing to files, databases, or network connections is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters into processing logic, primarily through sampling and calculations. No untrusted data flows into external systems or outputs; all data is internally processed.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be well-structured and uses standard library functions for math and itertools. No suspicious or obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are evident. No dynamic code execution or misleading variable names are present.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform standard probabilistic and combinatorial operations: permutation, combination, random sequence generation, Markov chain simulation, and random partitioning. They rely on the imported 'random' and 'math' modules for core operations, with input validation to prevent invalid parameters. The implementation appears legitimate and aligns with common algorithms in stochastic simulations. No signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection, are detected. All logic is transparent, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of legitimate probabilistic utility functions with proper input validation and no evidence of malicious intent. It does not perform any suspicious or harmful operations. Overall security risk is low, with no indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities within this module.",
