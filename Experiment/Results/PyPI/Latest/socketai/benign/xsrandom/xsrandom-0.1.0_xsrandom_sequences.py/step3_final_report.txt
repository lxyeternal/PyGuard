  "purpose": "A collection of probabilistic and combinatorial utility functions including permutation, combination, random sequence generation, Markov chains, and partitioning, intended for stochastic computations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as iterable sequences, lengths, probabilities, and transition matrices; local import of '.core' module for random functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or system calls; internal data flow within functions, primarily manipulating input parameters and returning results.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through validation, then used in sampling, shuffling, or sequence generation; no external data flows or untrusted data outside parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a local module '.core' which is external and unverified; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected; functions are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard probabilistic and combinatorial functions with proper validation and no malicious logic. The only potential concern is the imported '.core' module, which could contain malicious code, but cannot be assessed here. The functions do not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or system commands. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are present. The code is transparent and uses common Python constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign collection of utility functions for stochastic computations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary risk stems from the external '.core' module, which is unverified; if that module is malicious, it could compromise the system. Otherwise, the code itself is safe.",
