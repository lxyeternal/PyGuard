  "purpose": "The code provides various functions for random sampling, permutations, combinations, random walks, Markov sequences, and partitioning, primarily for stochastic data generation and manipulation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, such as iterables, numeric values, and optional initial states. It also imports standard Python libraries and a local core module for random functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of untrusted input parameters to generate data that could be misused if exploited, but no direct data exfiltration or malicious network activity is present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions, which process data using random or mathematical operations, returning sequences, lists, or numerical outputs. No untrusted data flows directly to insecure sinks like system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are detected. All code appears to perform standard random or combinatorial operations. The import of a local core module could potentially contain malicious code, but its contents are unknown and cannot be assessed here.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard mathematical and random functions for stochastic processes. It validates input parameters properly, preventing common errors. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious logic. The code does not perform network operations, file access, or other system-level actions that could indicate malicious intent. It relies on a local core module, which could be a concern if malicious, but cannot be evaluated from this snippet alone. Overall, the functions are consistent with typical stochastic algorithms without any evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a collection of stochastic and combinatorial utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior. The only potential concern is the import of a local core module, which could contain malicious code, but this cannot be assessed from the given snippet. No malicious activity or sabotage is evident in this code fragment.",
