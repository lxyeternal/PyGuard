  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The code provides probabilistic functions with input validation, no external data sources or sinks.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or obfuscated code; standard algorithms; no malicious intent.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low security risk (0.1), malware score 0, obfuscated 0, high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent with the code. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, with standard random/combinatorial functions, no external data or system calls.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code; functions are typical for statistical purposes.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Security risk very low (0), malware score 0, obfuscated 0, high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Standard random and combinatorial operations, no external system interactions.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly higher security risk (0.2) due to reliance on untrusted input but no malicious activity. Malware score remains 0, confidence high (0.95).\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly elevated security risk score is reasonable given untrusted inputs, but no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Functions for stochastic processes, using standard modules and a local core module.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The only concern is the import of `.core`, which could potentially contain malicious code.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report notes this and assigns a security risk of 0.2, but cannot verify the core module. Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The caution about the local core module is justified. The overall analysis remains conservative, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to others, with standard random/combinatorial functions, no external system calls.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low security risk (0.1), malware score 0, high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard set of probabilistic utility functions.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The only potential concern is the import of a local `.core` module (Report 4), which could contain malicious code, but there's no evidence here.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Given the absence of malicious code, the malware score should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated:** The code is clear; obfuscation score remains **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The overall security risk should stay low, around **0.1–0.2**, primarily due to reliance on untrusted inputs and the unknown `.core` module.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1–0.2** (minimal, mainly due to external core module and untrusted inputs)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.",
