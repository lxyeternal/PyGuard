  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign collection of utility functions for stochastic computations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary risk stems from the external '.core' module, which is unverified; if that module is malicious, it could compromise the system. Otherwise, the code itself is safe."
