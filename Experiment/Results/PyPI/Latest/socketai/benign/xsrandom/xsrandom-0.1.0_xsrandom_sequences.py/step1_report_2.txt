{
  "purpose": "Provide various random and combinatorial functions such as permutations, combinations, random walks, Markov sequences, and partitions.",
  "sources": "Reads include input parameters, calls to imported functions (_math, _itertools, randint, choice, choices, sample, shuffle, random).",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks of untrusted data or external network connections. No use of environment variables, system commands, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions, which perform local computations, sampling, and list manipulations. No external data or command execution detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious strings, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard combinatorial and random operations with proper validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for combinatorial and probabilistic operations, including permutation, combination, unique sequence generation, subset sampling, random walk, Markov chain simulation, and random partitioning. It performs input validation and uses standard Python modules (_math, _itertools). No external system calls, network operations, or secret leaks are evident. Functions like random_walk and markov_sequence rely on proper random selection; no malicious behavior is detected. The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for random data generation with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured utility module for combinatorial and probabilistic functions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The functions perform as intended without security issues.",
