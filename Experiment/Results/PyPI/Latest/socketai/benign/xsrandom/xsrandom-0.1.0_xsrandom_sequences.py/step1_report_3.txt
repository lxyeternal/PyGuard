{
  "purpose": "This module provides various functions for random sampling, permutations, combinations, sequences, and Markov processes, primarily for use in simulations, statistical modeling, or probabilistic analysis.",
  "sources": "Uses imported modules (_math, _itertools, and functions from .core: randint, choice, choices, sample, shuffle, random). Reads input data from function parameters such as iterable objects, numerical values, and state lists.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe usage includes reliance on untrusted inputs (e.g., iterables, parameters) which could cause resource exhaustion or logic errors but does not lead to direct data leaks or system compromise. No evident network, file, or system command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (parameters, iterables, states, matrices) flow into functions, which process them using random selection or calculations, and produce sequences, permutations, subsets, or partitions as output. No untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks like system calls or external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses standard random functions and mathematical operations. Input validation appears consistent. No suspicious dynamic code execution or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard random and combinatorial operations, with proper input validation and error handling. Functions like permutation, combination, and Markov sequence generation rely on external random functions and mathematical calculations, without any suspicious or malicious logic. The functions are typical for statistical or simulation purposes. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident. The code does not invoke system commands, network operations, or sensitive data leaks. It appears to be a safe utility module for probabilistic and combinatorial operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and purely focused on probabilistic computations and sequence generation without any malicious intent or harmful behavior. It is a standard utility module for randomness and combinatorics, with no suspicious anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
