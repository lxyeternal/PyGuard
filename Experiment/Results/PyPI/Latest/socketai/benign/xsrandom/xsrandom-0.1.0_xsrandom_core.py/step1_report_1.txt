{
  "purpose": "Provides extended functions for generating random values, expanding Python's standard random module.",
  "sources": "Reads system time, system process info, and internal random generator state.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no data output or transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Uses system entropy and internal generator state to produce random values; no external data flows or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Functions like seed_from_entropy() use system info for seeding but are standard in cryptographic contexts. No code injection, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The module provides various random number generation utilities with proper seeding and state management. Functions like randbytes() fallback to secure byte generation for Python < 3.9, which is standard. Seed functions incorporate system time and process info for entropy, typical for randomness. No signs of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. Usage of system info and entropy is consistent with legitimate random number needs. No suspicious external calls or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate extension of the Python random module with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It offers various utility functions for randomness generation without performing harmful operations.",
