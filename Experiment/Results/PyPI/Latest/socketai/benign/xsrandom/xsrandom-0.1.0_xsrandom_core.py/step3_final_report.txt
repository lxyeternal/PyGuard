  "purpose": "Extension of Python's standard random module providing additional utility functions for generating random values, seeding, and entropy sources.",
  "sources": "System time (time.time_ns, time.process_time_ns), internal random generator state, environment info (_sys.getrefcount).",
  "sinks": "No external data flows, network communication, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Internal functions use system info for seeding and entropy; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of system time and process info for entropy could be predictable but is standard practice; no obfuscation or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard random module with functions that rely solely on system info and internal state. No external communication, malicious payloads, or obfuscation are present. The seed_from_entropy() function uses system time and process info, which could be predictable but is common for entropy sources. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module for random data generation, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to entropy predictability, which does not constitute malicious intent. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The overall security assessment is that the code is safe and trustworthy.",
