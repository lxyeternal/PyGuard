{
  "purpose": "Provides extended functions for generating random values, enhancing the standard Python 'random' module.",
  "sources": "Reads system time, system process information, and uses internal generator methods for randomness; imports standard modules like time, sys, math, numpy.",
  "sinks": "Uses the random generator for producing random numbers, choices, bytes, and bits; no direct data leakage or external network operations detected.",
  "flows": "Sources such as time and system info feed into the seed function. Randomness flows through generator methods to produce various random outputs. No external data flows or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "Uses system time and process info for entropy in seed, which could be predictable if system state is known. The 'seed_from_entropy' function combines system time and process time, potentially predictable under certain conditions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The 'prime_below' function generates prime numbers but does not seem malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the Python 'random' module with additional functions such as seed, randbytes, bit_generator, and others, primarily for varied random data generation. The functions employ standard Python practices with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The use of system time and process time for entropy could be a minor concern but is common in such contexts. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious activities are detected. All functions operate within expected parameters, and the code structure is clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of the standard random module, providing additional utility functions for random data generation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of system entropy sources is typical for randomness initialization, though predictable entropy could slightly reduce randomness quality but not constitute malicious intent.",
