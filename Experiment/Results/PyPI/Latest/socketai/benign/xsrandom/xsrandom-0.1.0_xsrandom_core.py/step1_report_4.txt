{
  "purpose": "This module provides extended random number generation functions built on Python's standard 'random' module, including various utility functions for generating random values, selecting random items, and manipulating internal generator state.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time (_time), system process info (_sys), and uses the default Random instance (_DEFAULT_GENERATOR) as input sources. No external inputs or network data are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit data sinks or outputs such as network communication, file writing, or environment variable modification. The code primarily generates random data within the process.",
  "flows": "Data flows originate from system time or internal generator state (sources), through various functions like random(), randint(), choice(), etc., and produce random values; no external data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains functions such as seed_from_entropy() which combines system time and process info to reseed the generator; no suspicious or malicious code behavior like data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors is present. Usage of standard random functions does not imply malicious intent. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Functions like prime_below and dual_distribution are standard utilities. No malicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the Python random module with various utility functions for randomness. It reads system time, process info, and internally manages seedings. No external network or file operations are present, and no code appears designed to perform harmful actions. It does not collect or leak sensitive data, nor does it execute code from untrusted sources. The inclusion of seed_from_entropy() introduces custom entropy collection, but does not perform any malicious activity. Overall, the code seems focused on providing randomness utilities without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for generating random values, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It operates solely within the process environment, offering various randomness functions without external data leaks or harmful actions.",
