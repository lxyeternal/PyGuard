  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of the 'diatomics' module, which cannot be evaluated here. The scores should reflect low maliciousness and obfuscation, with a low to moderate security risk. The overall assessment is that the code is safe, with the main risk stemming from external dependencies."
