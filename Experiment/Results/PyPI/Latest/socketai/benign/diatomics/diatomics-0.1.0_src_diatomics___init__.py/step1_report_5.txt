{
  "purpose": "The script searches for diatomic molecules containing specified atoms and outputs matching molecules.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for atoms; calls get_diatomics() to retrieve molecule data.",
  "sinks": "Outputs messages to stdout; no data sink that leaks untrusted data identified.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> filtering logic -> printing molecule info based on name matches.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns; standard use of argparse and print statements.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts atom names as input, retrieves diatomic molecules via get_diatomics(), and filters molecules based on atom presence. No untrusted data processing beyond argument parsing, and the filtering is based on molecule names. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The usage of get_diatomics() depends on an external library, but the call itself appears legitimate. The logic is straightforward with no obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple molecule search based on user input with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a benign script intended for molecular data retrieval and filtering.",
