  "purpose": "This script searches for diatomic molecules containing specified atoms by querying an external data source.",
  "sources": "Input data from command-line arguments (args.atoms).",
  "sinks": "Print statements for output; no untrusted data sinks that pose security risks.",
  "flows": "User input (atoms) -> logic filters -> printed output; no data flows into external systems or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The function get_diatomics() is imported but its implementation is unknown; assuming it's a safe external data source.",
  "analysis": "The code takes command-line arguments, processes them to search for specific molecules, and outputs results based on the molecule data. There are no evident security vulnerabilities such as code injection, data leaks, or malicious payloads. Usage of the external function get_diatomics() depends on its implementation, but this is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and intended for querying and displaying data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple command-line utility for querying molecule data with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe with no malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
