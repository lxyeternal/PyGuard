  "purpose": "A command-line utility to search for diatomic molecules containing specified atoms by filtering data from get_diatomics().",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for atom names, external function get_diatomics() providing molecule data.",
  "sinks": "Console output of matching molecules; no data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input args -> filter molecules from get_diatomics() -> print matching molecules.",
  "anomalies": "Minor syntax error in the print statement of the first report; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code takes atom names as input, retrieves molecule data via get_diatomics(), and filters molecules based on name containing the atoms. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The external dependency's safety is assumed. The syntax error in the print statement should be corrected, but it does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1) due to reliance on external data. Overall, the code is benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, simple molecule search utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only issue is a minor syntax bug in the print statement, which should be fixed. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
