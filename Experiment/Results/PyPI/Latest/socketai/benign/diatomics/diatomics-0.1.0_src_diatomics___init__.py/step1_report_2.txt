  "purpose": "The script searches for diatomic molecules containing specified atoms.",
  "sources": "Input from command line arguments via argparse (args.atoms).",
  "sinks": "Console output using print(). No data is written to files or external systems.",
  "flows": "Command line input (atoms) -> Filtering and printing molecules from diatomics data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration. Usage of get_diatomics() appears to be a standard library call, assuming it is benign. No obfuscation, no unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code takes atom names as input, verifies input length, and searches through diatomic molecule data obtained from get_diatomics(). It outputs matching molecules based on input criteria. No handling of untrusted data beyond command-line arguments. No external system calls, network activity, or data leaks are detected. The code seems straightforward and intended solely for querying data. The import from 'diatomics.connector' is a dependency, but without malicious behavior shown here, it appears to be a legitimate package. Overall, the code does not contain malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple molecule search utility that processes user input to filter and display molecules. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The reliance on an external library is standard, with no evident malicious intent.",
