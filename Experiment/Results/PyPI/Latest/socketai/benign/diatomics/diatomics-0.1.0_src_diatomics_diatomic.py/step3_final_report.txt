{
  "purpose": "The code defines a data class 'DiatomicMolecule' with attributes representing molecular properties and a __str__ method that formats these properties into a human-readable string with Unicode symbols for scientific notation.",
  "sources": "The class attributes such as 'electronic_state', 'Te_cm', and 'Re_AA' are read directly from the instance data during string formatting.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code only reads its own attributes for display purposes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes into the __str__ method, where string replacements are performed for formatting, then output as a string.",
  "anomalies": "The multiple string replacements on 'electronic_state' are redundant but serve purely for formatting; no malicious or obfuscated code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data container with a custom string representation. It performs static string replacements to convert notation into Unicode symbols for readability. There are no external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The replacements are simple and serve display purposes, not obfuscation or malicious intent. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified based on the benign and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data class for representing molecular data with formatting enhancements. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk accurately reflect its safety.",
