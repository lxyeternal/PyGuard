  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward data class with a custom `__str__` method for formatting. There are no indications of external data inputs, network activity, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. The string replacements are solely for formatting symbols and do not involve any obfuscation or malicious logic.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the string replacement operations are benign formatting steps, not malicious or obfuscated code. No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. The obfuscated score is also 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward string replacements.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely for data representation and formatting, with no external interactions or suspicious behaviors, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The current scores are reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All assessments are based on the code's actual content, not assumptions. The string replacements are for display purposes, not obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Evaluation and Personal Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured data class with a string formatting method. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain dependency is safe. No further action is needed.",
