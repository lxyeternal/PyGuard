{
  "purpose": "The code defines a data class for representing diatomic molecules with various physical and spectroscopic properties, including a method for formatted string output.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class attributes such as 'name', 'electronic_state', 'Te_cm', 'Re_AA', and others.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks or outputs that handle untrusted data; the __str__ method only formats existing attribute data into a string.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes into the __str__ method for formatting, but there are no external data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "The string replacement logic within __str__ appears complex but is solely for formatting purposes; no suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The use of raw string replacements for special characters is standard formatting code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data container with a method to produce a formatted string. It does not include input/output operations beyond string formatting, nor does it interact with external systems or perform network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The only notable complexity is the formatting logic for LaTeX-like symbols, which is benign. No hardcoded credentials, environment variable misuse, or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data class used for representing molecular properties with custom string formatting. There are no malicious or suspicious behaviors identified. The code is secure and free from malware or security risks.",
