{
  "purpose": "Define a data class for representing diatomic molecule properties and provide a string representation method with symbolic replacements.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`dataclasses`, `datetime`), class attributes, and the `__str__` method.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted input handling, data output, or network operations.",
  "flows": "None; no data flows from sources to sinks that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "The `__str__` method performs multiple string replacements with raw string patterns, which could be redundant but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class with optional attributes related to molecular data, and a string method that formats and replaces certain patterns in the `electronic_state`. The replacements use `.replace()` with raw string literals, mainly for symbol substitution, which appears to be for formatting purposes. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. The code is straightforward and mainly focused on formatting output, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data container with a formatting method; it shows no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It simply formats property strings for display purposes. No malware or security risks detected.",
