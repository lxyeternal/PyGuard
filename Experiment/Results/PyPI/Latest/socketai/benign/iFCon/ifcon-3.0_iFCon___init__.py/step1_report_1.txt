{
  "purpose": "Importing the iFConFile class from the local module .iFConFile, likely for use within the current package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module (.iFConFile), which may contain code or data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data processing present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "Import statement imports code from a local module; no data flows are evident here.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, but potential concern if .iFConFile contains malicious code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing a class from a local module. This is typical for package structure and does not indicate malicious intent by itself. Without inspecting the contents of .iFConFile, it's impossible to determine if it contains malicious code or backdoors. The line itself does not perform any dangerous actions or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement; no malicious behavior can be inferred from this line alone. Further review of the .iFConFile module would be necessary to assess security risks.",
