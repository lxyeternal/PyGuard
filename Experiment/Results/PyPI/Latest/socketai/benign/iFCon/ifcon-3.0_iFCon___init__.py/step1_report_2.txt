  "purpose": "Import the iFConFile class from the local module .iFConFile, likely for handling configuration or file operations within the package.",

  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond the import statement",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. Importing a class from a local module is standard.",
  "analysis": "This code consists solely of an import statement, which is a common practice in Python to include functionality from other modules. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. Since the code is minimal, it cannot be evaluated for malicious intent beyond the import itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be part of normal package structure.",
