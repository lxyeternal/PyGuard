  "purpose": "To import the class iFConFile from a local module, enabling its use in the current context.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output data, nor does it handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows within this minimal code snippet; it only imports a class without executing further logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard relative import of a class from a local module. It does not perform any operations, data handling, or network activity. Given the minimal context, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The import alone is benign; potential risks depend entirely on the contents of the imported module, which cannot be assessed here. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (0.1), reflecting the minimal inherent risk of a simple import statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns. The risk is minimal, and the scores are consistent with the code's simplicity. Further inspection of the imported module is recommended for comprehensive security assessment, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe.",
