  "purpose": "Importing the class 'iFConFile' from a local module in the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'iFConFile' class from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling is present in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing is observable from this line alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are visible.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a relative import of 'iFConFile' from a local module. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data leakage, or security issues in this import statement alone. Since no other code is provided, it's impossible to assess further behavior or potential risks. The import appears standard for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single import statement, there is no indication of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risk. It appears to be a normal import of a class from a local module.",
