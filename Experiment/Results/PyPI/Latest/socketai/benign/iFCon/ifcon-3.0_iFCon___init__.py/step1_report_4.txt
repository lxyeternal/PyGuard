  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow or untrusted data handling shown",
  "flows": "None detected; only an import statement",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import is standard; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement bringing in the class iFConFile from a local module. There are no functions, no data processing, and no external input or output operations. This minimal code fragment does not indicate malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. Since only an import statement is shown, it is impossible to assess the entire module’s behavior, but based on this snippet, there is no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports a class from a local module, and there is no evidence of malware or security concerns in this fragment.",
