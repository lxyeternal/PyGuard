{
  "purpose": "The code implements a custom binary file container format called iFConFile, allowing reading, writing, and extracting files and folders from a single archive.",
  "sources": "Reads include file input streams when opening and reading headers, index, file contents, and reading from the filesystem for adding files and folders.",
  "sinks": "Writes include header, index, and file data into the archive file; filesystem writes occur during extraction and saving; no network or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (file content and filesystem data) flows into the archive creation, while stored index data is used to locate and extract files, which are written back to disk during extraction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns such as obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or hardcoded credentials. No dynamic code execution, suspicious system calls, or backdoors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a file archive format with methods to add, extract, and save files and folders. It performs straightforward file I/O, data serialization, and deserialization without any external network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic. The reading and writing of file data is standard, and the code maintains internal consistency. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or covert channels. The only potential concern could be misuse of the archive to store sensitive data, but that is dependent on user intent, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a custom archive format with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It performs file packaging and extraction functions securely, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
