{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for extracting or packing iFCon files using the iFConFile class.",
  "sources": "User inputs from command-line arguments: 'file', '--extract', '--pack', and '--output'.",
  "targets": "Methods of the iFConFile class, specifically extractAll and addfolder, which operate on files and directories specified by user input.",
  "flows": "User provides a filename and either extract or pack option -> iFConFile is instantiated with the filename -> extractAll or addfolder method is called based on user choice -> data is read or written to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behaviors. Use of standard argparse and file handling. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard argument parsing to determine whether to extract or pack an iFCon file. It instantiates the iFConFile class with the provided filename in binary mode. The methods extractAll and addfolder are called depending on the operation. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code relies on the external iFConFile class for core functionality, which is not provided here but assumed to be standard file handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign command-line utility for managing iFCon files with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It simply facilitates file operations based on user input.",
