{
  "purpose": "A command-line tool for extracting or packing iFCon files, utilizing the iFConFile class for file operations.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line arguments: 'file', 'pack'; reading these to determine file paths and actions.",
  "sinks": "File operations performed via iFConFile methods (extractAll, addfolder), which handle files based on user input.",
  "flows": "User provides a filename and either extraction or packing command; the script instantiates iFConFile with these files and calls relevant methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code properly handles command-line inputs without evident malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments to perform file extraction or packing using the iFConFile class. It reads user inputs directly and calls corresponding methods for file operations. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The code relies on external class 'iFConFile' for core functionality, which is not provided here. Overall, the script appears straightforward, with no malicious or maliciously obfuscated code. It functions as a typical command-line utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard command-line utility for managing iFCon files without any apparent malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It securely processes user inputs and performs file operations accordingly.",
