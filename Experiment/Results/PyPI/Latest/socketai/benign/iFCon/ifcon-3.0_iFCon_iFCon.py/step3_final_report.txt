  "purpose": "A command-line utility for extracting and packing iFCon files using the external iFConFile class.",
  "sources": "User input file path, command-line arguments for extract or pack operations.",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations via iFConFile methods, no untrusted data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> file opening in binary mode -> method calls on iFConFile -> file closure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that parses arguments and delegates file operations to the external iFConFile class. It performs standard file handling without network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The class's internal behavior is unknown, but the code itself is benign. No logical errors or security issues are apparent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for managing iFCon files, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, assuming the external class is safe. Overall, the code appears secure and appropriate for its purpose.",
