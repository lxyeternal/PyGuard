  "purpose": "A command-line tool for extracting and packing iFCon files using the iFConFile class.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for file paths, operation modes (extract or pack), and output directory.",
  "sinks": "Uses file paths from user input to read/write files and manipulate iFCon files.",
  "flows": "User input (file, operation mode, output directory) → iFConFile methods (extractAll, addfolder) → file system.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No unsafe operations or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily parses command-line arguments and calls methods on an imported iFConFile class to manipulate files. No data is sent over the network, no system information is leaked, and no malicious commands are executed. The code depends on external class iFConFile for core functionality, which is not provided. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident within this snippet. The code structure and flow are straightforward, with no unusual or obfuscated code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI utility for handling iFCon files. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected within this code fragment. Security risks are minimal, assuming the external iFConFile class is safe.",
