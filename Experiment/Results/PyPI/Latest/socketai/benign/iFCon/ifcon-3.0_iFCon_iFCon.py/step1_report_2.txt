  "purpose": "A command-line tool for extracting and packing iFCon files using the iFConFile class.",
  "sources": "Input filename from command-line argument 'file', optional folder path from 'pack'.",
  "sinks": "File operations (reading or writing files) through iFConFile methods 'extractAll' and 'addfolder'.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> iFConFile object creation -> extractAll or addfolder method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior. Usage appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments to either extract or pack an iFCon file. It utilizes the iFConFile class (imported locally) to perform file operations. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code relies on user-supplied file paths and folder names, which is typical for such tools. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent in this code segment. The code is simple and functional, with no obfuscated patterns or hidden functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a basic CLI utility for handling iFCon files without any suspicious or malicious activity. It does not perform any network operations or contain hidden behaviors. The security risk is minimal and primarily related to the security of the iFConFile class implementation, which is not provided here.",
