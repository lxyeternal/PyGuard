{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'iFCon', defining its metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, package discovery via find_packages(), and hardcoded metadata fields such as name, version, author, and email.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the script only sets up package metadata and entry points without data processing or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets are standard for setup scripts, and there are no hidden code execution paths.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads a README file for description, and defines package metadata including author details, license, URL, and package discovery. Entry points define a console script. The code performs standard setup tasks without any dynamic code execution, network calls, or processing of untrusted input. All fields are typical for a Python package configuration. No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It is safe to use as intended.",
