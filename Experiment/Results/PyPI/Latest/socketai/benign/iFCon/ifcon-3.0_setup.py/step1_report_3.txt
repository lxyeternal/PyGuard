  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the iFCon Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading the long description from 'README.md', setting package metadata, and defining entry points.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; no dynamic code execution or network operations.",
  "flows": "The only flow involves reading a file ('README.md') for description data during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the script performs standard setup operations without hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py file using setuptools to package a Python project. It reads a README file for the long description, defines package metadata, specifies a console script entry point, and sets classifiers. All operations are standard and do not involve processing untrusted input or executing code beyond package configuration. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and safe. It performs standard packaging tasks without any malicious intent or security risks.",
