  "targets": "N/A (no data flow or untrusted data handling)",
  "flows": "N/A (standard setup script without runtime data processing)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup.py file that defines package metadata and configuration. It uses standard libraries and functions such as setuptools and find_packages. The long_description reads from a local README.md file, which is common. No malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior is present. Entry points define a console script, but do not invoke any dangerous actions. The author email appears to be a generic address, but that alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be legitimate, standard packaging code without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks are evident.",
