  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, reading README.md, and setting entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, uses 'find_packages()' to discover packages, defines console_scripts entry point.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution, network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A - straightforward package setup without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Author name 'eWloYW8' appears as a base64-encoded string, but this is not inherently malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-formed setup.py script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The author name's encoding is benign and likely a placeholder. All reports correctly identify the script as safe, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and risk score of 0. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity and clarity of the code. No dynamic or external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation techniques are present.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks. The base64-encoded author name does not indicate malicious obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and the overall assessment confirms the package's safety.",
