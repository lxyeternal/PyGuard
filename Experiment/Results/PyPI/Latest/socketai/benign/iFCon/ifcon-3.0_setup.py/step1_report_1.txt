{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the iFCon Python tool.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, package discovery via find_packages(), reading setup parameters.",
  "targets": "No direct untrusted input or data sources are handled; the script primarily defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A - the script does not process untrusted data streams or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious indicators present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata, discover packages, and specify entry points for command-line execution. It reads a local README file for documentation and sets standard package information such as name, version, author, license, and classifiers. No external data sources, user inputs, or dynamic code execution are involved. The code structure is straightforward, adhering to typical setup.py conventions without any suspicious or malicious code features.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
