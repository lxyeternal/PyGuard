  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'iFCon' including metadata, package discovery, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading long_description from 'README.md', package discovery via find_packages(), and package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no runtime data processing or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> Package setup variables -> Define console script entry point.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The author name appears as a base64-encoded string ('eWloYW8'), but this is not inherently malicious. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file for the long description, discovers packages automatically, and sets up a console script entry point. The author name is not meaningful and could be scrutinized further, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent. No external inputs, untrusted data handling, or security-critical operations are present. All functions and variables serve typical packaging purposes. No anomalies or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and standard for Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code.",
