{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides simple substitution-based methods for encrypting and decrypting strings using emoji and symbol replacements.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from method parameters 'string' in 'encrypt' and 'encrypted_token' in 'decrypt'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs transformed strings; no external data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed through a series of string replacements in 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods, mapping characters to emojis and vice versa.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward character substitution without any obfuscated code, external data access, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The substitution is symmetrical and static, and there are no input validation or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a substitution cipher using emoji and symbols for character mapping. The 'encrypt' method replaces characters with emojis, while 'decrypt' reverses the process. There is no external data access, no network communication, no file operations, or code execution involved. The design is simplistic and purely mapping characters to other characters, which does not constitute malicious behavior or malware. There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns. The implementation appears to be a benign obfuscation or encoding mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple substitution cipher based on emoji mapping; it shows no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is a benign encoding utility with no security risks identified.",
