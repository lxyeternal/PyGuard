{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple substitution cipher for encrypting and decrypting strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The methods take input strings for encryption and encrypted tokens for decryption.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to files, send data over networks, or interact with system resources; it only processes strings in memory.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow into encrypt/decrypt methods, undergo character replacements, and produce transformed strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The substitution cipher is simplistic and does not provide security, but it is not malicious. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a straightforward character substitution cipher, replacing alphanumeric and some punctuation characters with emojis for obfuscation. The decrypt method reverses this process. No input/output operations, network activity, or system modifications are involved. The code appears intended for simple obfuscation rather than secure encryption. No suspicious or malicious behavior identified. The design is simple, with direct string replacements, and does not include external dependencies or unsafe code practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic character substitution cipher for obfuscation, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not exhibit malware behaviors such as data exfiltration or system manipulation. Overall, it is benign but insecure for cryptographic purposes.",
