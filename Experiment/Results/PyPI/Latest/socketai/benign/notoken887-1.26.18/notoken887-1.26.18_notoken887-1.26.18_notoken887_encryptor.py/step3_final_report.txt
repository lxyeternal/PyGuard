  "purpose": "A class providing character substitution encoding and decoding using emojis for obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Method parameters 'string' and 'encrypted_token' for input data.",
  "sinks": "In-memory string replacements; no external data sinks or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via sequential replacements from characters to emojis (encrypt) and emojis back to characters (decrypt).",
  "anomalies": "Use of extensive emoji mappings as a form of simple obfuscation; no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no external data access.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static character substitutions for encoding and decoding, with no external dependencies or malicious behaviors. The extensive emoji mappings serve as a basic obfuscation method. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or external data leaks are present. The code is straightforward, with no complex logic or obfuscation beyond static replacements. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious activity. The obfuscation level is moderate due to emoji use, warranting a score around 0.6. The overall security risk is negligible, approximately 0.1, given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static substitution cipher intended for obfuscation or aesthetic encoding. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, and no adjustments are necessary.",
