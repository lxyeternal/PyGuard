  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining metadata, package discovery, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Metadata fields such as name, version, author, author_email, description, url, classifiers, python_requires, and entry_points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external data input, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static setup configuration with no data flow or code execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org'), and description referencing obfuscation testing, but no actual obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with no embedded malicious or obfuscated code. Metadata contains unprofessional contact info, which is suspicious but not indicative of malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code and obfuscation, assigning malware score 0 and obfuscated score 0. Risk scores are low (~0.2-0.3), justified by metadata concerns. Confidence levels are high (0.7-0.9). No code-level vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The primary concern is metadata suspicion, not technical security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is benign and standard, with suspicious metadata that could be used for social engineering or reputation issues but does not contain active malicious code or obfuscation. Scores are consistent with the evidence; malware and obfuscated scores remain at 0, and risk score is approximately 0.3 due to metadata concerns.",
