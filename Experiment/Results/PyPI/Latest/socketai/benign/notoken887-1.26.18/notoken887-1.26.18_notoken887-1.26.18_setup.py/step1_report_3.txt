  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887', including metadata, package discovery, and entry point for command-line execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the setup() parameters, find_packages(), and the 'console_scripts' entry point.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code primarily sets package metadata and entry points.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The author_email is set to 'hitler@gmail.com', which is suspicious and unprofessional; the description mentions 'obfuscation test lib' which could imply obfuscation activities but no actual obfuscation code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and console entry points. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The only notable concern is the author_email, which appears intentionally provocative or unprofessional. No signs of malware, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The package appears to be a normal setup configuration with questionable metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks found in the code itself. The primary concern is the questionable email address used for the author, which is unprofessional but not malicious.",
