{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and distribution of the cuik_molmaker Python module, including copying a compiled extension and creating an __init__.py to load the extension.",
  "sources": "Environment variable PACKAGE_VERSION, file system checks for build artifacts, and the script itself reading/writing files",
  "sinks": "File system operations (os.path.exists, shutil.copy2, open/write), print statements for logging, dynamic module loading via importlib machinery",
  "flows": "Environment variable PACKAGE_VERSION is used for versioning; script checks for .so file and copies it; __init__.py dynamically loads extension module at runtime; module attributes are imported into globals()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network operations; dynamic import of compiled extension is typical for C extensions; no obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution; print statements are benign; no untrusted input sources evident",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup process for a Python C extension package. It reads environment variables for versioning, checks for prebuilt shared object files, copies them if present, and generates an __init__.py to dynamically load the shared object at import time. The __init__.py script uses standard importlib machinery to load a .so file found in the same directory, then imports its attributes into the package namespace. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, network activity, or data leaks. All operations are typical for packaging compiled extensions, and no suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate package setup process with no indications of malicious intent or malware. It dynamically loads a compiled extension safely within expected use cases. No security risks or malware are detected.",
