{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up a Python package named 'cuik_molmaker', copying a compiled shared object (.so) file, and dynamically importing it.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_VERSION', filesystem (checking and copying files), and script code itself.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem operations (os.path.exists, shutil.copy2, open), dynamic module loading via importlib, printing to console.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_VERSION' influences package version; filesystem checks locate and copy the .so file; the __init__.py dynamically loads the .so module at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic creation of __init__.py that automatically loads any '.so' file in the directory; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no network communication or suspicious external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, handling file system checks, copying a compiled extension, and generating an __init__.py to load the extension dynamically. It uses standard libraries and conventional methods. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The dynamic import via importlib is standard for extension modules. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a scientific Python package with compiled extensions. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected. The dynamic import mechanism is standard for extension modules and does not indicate malicious intent.",
