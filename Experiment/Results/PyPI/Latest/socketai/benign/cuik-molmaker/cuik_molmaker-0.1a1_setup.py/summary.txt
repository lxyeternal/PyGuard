  "conclusion": "The code itself is standard and does not contain malicious code. However, the pattern of dynamically loading shared objects without validation introduces a supply chain security risk. If malicious shared libraries are supplied, they could execute arbitrary code upon import. The malware score should be low but non-zero, and the overall risk is moderate. Implementing checksum verification or signature validation for the shared objects would mitigate this risk."
