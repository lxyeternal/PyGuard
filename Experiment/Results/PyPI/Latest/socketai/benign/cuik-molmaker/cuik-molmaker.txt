      "conclusion": "The code itself is standard and does not contain malicious code. However, the pattern of dynamically loading shared objects without validation introduces a supply chain security risk. If malicious shared libraries are supplied, they could execute arbitrary code upon import. The malware score should be low but non-zero, and the overall risk is moderate. Implementing checksum verification or signature validation for the shared objects would mitigate this risk."

      "conclusion": "The script is straightforward and does not contain malicious code; however, it poses a significant security risk if the loaded .so file is malicious or compromised. The pattern of loading untrusted native code without validation can lead to arbitrary code execution, making it potentially dangerous in untrusted environments."
