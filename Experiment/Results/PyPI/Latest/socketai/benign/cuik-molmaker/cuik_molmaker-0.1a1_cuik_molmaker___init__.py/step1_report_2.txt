  "purpose": "Dynamically load a compiled extension (.so file) located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the directory contents to find a .so file in the current script directory.",
  "sinks": "The code loads and executes a shared object file, then imports its attributes into the global namespace.",
  "flows": "Directory listing -> selection of .so file -> loading via ExtensionFileLoader -> executing module -> importing attributes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic execution, or obfuscated code detected. Uses standard importlib machinery to load a native extension file.",
  "analysis": "The script searches the current directory for a file ending with '.so'. When found, it uses importlib's ExtensionFileLoader to load the shared object as a Python module, then imports all non-private attributes into the global namespace. This is a common pattern for dynamically loading compiled extensions. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The dynamic loading approach itself is standard for native modules. No anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code safely loads a shared object file from the current directory and imports its attributes, without signs of malicious intent. It performs a standard dynamic import of a native extension. No security risks identified.",
